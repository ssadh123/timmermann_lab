Agent. All prepayments of Eurodollar Rate Loans and CD Rate Loans shall be
applied to the payment of any interest that has accrued to the date of such

Base Rate as the case may be.

(b) Subject to Section 2.8(c), from and after the Effective Date,
interest shall be payable in arrears on the Loans on each Interest Payment Date
applicable to that Loan. Interest paid on the date of any partial prepayment of
Loans hereunder shall be paid in respect of the portion of the Loans so prepaid.

(c) Any principal payments on the Loans not paid when due and, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans not
paid when due, in each case whether at stated maturity, by notice of prepayment,
by acceleration or otherwise, shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand
at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise
payable under this Agreement.

-------------------------------- 
Loans and fees payable under this Agreement shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it
accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of the Loan
or the first day of an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be included
and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided that, if a Loan is repaid on
-------- 
the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.

(b) Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change
in the Applicable Amount, Reserve Percentage or Eurodollar Reserve Percentage
shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such
change in the Applicable Amount or Eurodollar Reserve Percentage becomes
effective. Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent pursuant hereto
shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and the Banks in the absence of

payment which is received by the Agent after that time shall be deemed to have
been paid by the Company on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

(b) Subject to the provisions in the definition of "Interest Period",
whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such

-21-
<PAGE>

time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as
the case may be.

(c) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the
Company will not make such payment in full as and when required hereunder, the
Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in full to the Agent on
such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so
required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and
to the extent the Company shall not have made such payment in full to the Agent,
each Bank shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount distributed to such
Bank, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate as in effect for each such day.

(San Francisco time) one Business Day prior to the date of any proposed
borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Bank will not make available to the
Agent as and when required hereunder for the account of the Company the amount
of that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the borrowing, the Agent may assume that each
Bank has made such amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds
on the Funding Date and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made its
full amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds and the Agent
in such circumstances has made available to the Company such amount, that Bank
shall on the next Business Day following the date of such borrowing make such
amount available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate
for and determined as of each day during such period. A notice of the Agent
submitted to any Bank with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.12(a)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made
available, such payment to the Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on the
date of borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not
made available to the Agent on the next Business Day following the date of such
borrowing, the Agent shall notify the Company of

-22-
<PAGE>

such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Agent, the Company shall pay such
amount to the Agent for the Agent's account, together with interest thereon for
each day elapsed since the date of such borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to
the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such borrowing.

(b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any date of borrowing
shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on
the date of such borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any
borrowing.

2.13 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If, other than as expressly provided
------------------------- 
elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by
it any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments on
account of the Loans obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith (a)
notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Banks such
participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
-------- 
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
- ------- 
recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be
rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase
price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Bank's Pro
Rata Share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank's
required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing
Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in
respect of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Bank so
purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.13 may,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such
participation. The Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased pursuant
to this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Banks following any such
purchases or repayments.

SECTION 3.

PAYMENTS IN GENERAL.
--------------------

3.1 Taxes.
----- 

(a) Subject to Section 3.1(d) and Section 3.1(g), any and all
payments by the Company to each Bank or the Agent under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any and all
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings,
and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank
and the Agent, such taxes (including income taxes or franchise taxes) as are
imposed on or measured by each Bank's or the Agent's net income by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be,
is organized or maintains a Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof
(all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").

(b) In addition, the Company shall pay any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) Subject to Section 3.1(g), the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Bank and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.1) paid by such Bank or the
Agent and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank or the
Agent makes written demand therefor.

(d) If the Company shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any
Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Bank
or the Agent, then, subject to Section 3.1(g): (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.1) such
Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received

-24-
<PAGE>

had no such deductions been made; (ii) the Company shall make such deductions,
and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(e) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Company of
Taxes or Other Taxes, the Company shall furnish to the Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to the Agent.

(f) Each Bank which is a foreign person (i.e., a person other than a
United States person for United States Federal income tax purposes) agrees that:
(i) it shall, no later than the Effective Date (or, in the case of a Bank which
becomes a party hereto after the Effective Date, the date upon which the Bank
becomes a party hereto) deliver to the Company and the Agent: (A) if any
Lending Office is located in the United States, two accurate and complete signed
originals of Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or any successor thereto ("Form
4224"), and (B) if any Lending Office is located outside the United States, two
accurate and complete signed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or
any successor thereto ("Form 1001"), in each case indicating that the Bank is on
the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest
and fees for the account of such Lending Office or Offices under this Agreement
free from withholding of United States Federal income tax; (ii) if at any time
the Bank changes its Lending Office or Offices or selects an additional Lending
Office as herein provided, it shall with reasonable promptness deliver to the
Company and the Agent in replacement for, or in addition to, the forms
previously delivered by it hereunder: (A) if such changed or additional Lending
Office is located in the United States, two accurate and complete signed
originals of Form 4224; or (B) otherwise, two accurate and complete signed
originals of Form 1001, in each case indicating that the Bank is on the date of
delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees
for the account of such changed or additional Lending Office under this
Agreement free from withholding of United States Federal income tax; (iii) it
shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any event (including the
passing of time but excluding any event mentioned in (ii) above) requiring a
change in the most recent Form 4224 or Form 1001 previously delivered by such
Bank and if the delivery of the same be lawful, deliver to the Company and the
Agent two accurate and complete original signed copies of Form 4224 or Form 1001
in replacement for the forms previously delivered by the Bank; and (iv) it
shall, promptly upon the Company's reasonable request to that effect, deliver to
the Company and the Agent such other forms or similar documentation

-25-
<PAGE>

as may be required from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or
regulation in order to establish such Bank's tax status for withholding
purposes.

(g) The Company will not be required to pay any additional amounts in
respect of United States Federal income tax pursuant to Section 3.1(d) to any
Bank for the account of any Lending Office of such Bank: (i) if the obligation
to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such
Bank to comply with its obligations under Section 3.1(f) in respect of such
Lending Office; (ii) if such Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form
4224 in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to Section 3.1(f)(i)(A), and
such Bank shall not be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of
United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the Company hereunder
for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in
United States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law
or regulations by any Governmental Person charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date
of delivery of such Form 4224; or (iii) if the Bank shall have delivered to the
Company a Form 1001 in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to Section
3.1(f)(i)(B), and such Bank shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from
deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of
payments by the Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any
reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or any applicable
tax treaty or regulations or in the official interpretation of any such law,
treaty or regulations by any Governmental Person charged with the interpretation
or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the
date of delivery of such Form 1001.

(h) If, at any time, the Company requests any Bank to deliver any
forms or other documentation pursuant to Section 3.1(f)(iv), then the Company
shall, on demand of such Bank through the Agent, reimburse such Bank for any
costs and expenses (including expenses of outside legal counsel and the
allocated costs of in-house counsel) reasonably incurred by such Bank in the
preparation or delivery of such forms or other documentation.

(i) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank
or the Agent pursuant to Section 3.1(d), then such Bank shall use its reasonable
best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional
payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue if

-26-
<PAGE>

such change in the judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to
such Bank.

(j) The agreements and obligations of the Company contained in this
Section 3.1 shall survive the payment in full of all other Obligations.

3.2 Capital Adequacy. If (a) any adoption of or any change in or in
---------------- 
the interpretation of any law, rule or regulation, or (b) compliance with any
guideline, request or directive of any central bank or other Governmental Person
or quasi-governmental authority exercising control over banks or financial
institutions generally or any court (whether or not having the force of law), or
(c) any change in the force or effectiveness of the regulations set forth at 12
C.F.R. Part 3 (Appendix A), 12 C.F.R. Part 225 (Appendix A), 12 C.F.R. Part 208
(Appendix A) or 12 C.F.R. Part 325 (Appendix A) requires that the commitments of
any Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, commitments and obligations
in respect of Loans) be treated as an asset or otherwise be included for
purposes of calculating the appropriate amount of capital to be maintained by
such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank (a "Change in Law"), the
result of which is to reduce the rate of return on such Bank's capital as a
consequence of such commitments to a level below that which such Bank could have
achieved but for such Change in Law, taking into consideration such Bank's
policies with respect to capital adequacy, by an amount which such Bank deems to
be material, the Bank shall deliver to the Company a statement of the amount
necessary to compensate such Bank for the reduction in the rate of return on its
capital attributable to such commitments (the "Capital Compensation Amount").
The Bank shall determine the Capital Compensation Amount in good faith, using
reasonable attribution and averaging methods. The Bank shall from time to time
notify the Company of the amount so determined. Such amount shall be due and
payable by the Company to such Bank ten Business Days after such notice is
given. As soon as practicable after any Change in Law, each Bank shall submit
to the Company estimates of the Capital Compensation Amounts that would be
payable as a function of such Bank's commitments hereunder.

3.3 Illegality.
---------- 

(a) If any Bank shall determine that any Governmental Rule or any
change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Person has asserted that it is unlawful, for
any Bank or its Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice
thereof by the Bank to the Company through the Agent, the obligation of the Bank
to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall

-27-
<PAGE>

be suspended until the Bank shall have notified the Agent and the Company that
the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exists.

(b) If a Bank shall determine that any Governmental Rule or any
change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Person has asserted that it is unlawful, for
any Bank or its Lending Office to maintain any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Company
shall prepay all Eurodollar Rate Loans of the Bank then outstanding, together
with interest accrued thereon, or convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of the Bank
then outstanding to CD Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.4,
either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if the Bank may lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or promptly, if the
Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans, together
with any amounts required to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to Section
3.5.

(c) If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans has been terminated, the Company may elect, by giving notice to the Bank
through the Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be made by the Bank as
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be instead CD Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans.

(d) Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section
3.3, the affected Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with respect
to its Eurodollar Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving
such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be
illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank.

3.4 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. If any Bank shall
--------------------------------------- 
determine that, due to either (a) the introduction of or any change (other than
any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included
in the calculation of the CD Rate or the Eurodollar Rate) in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (b) the compliance with any guideline
or request from any Governmental Person (whether or not having the force of
law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank of agreeing to make
or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans,
then the Company shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand
therefor by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to such
Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Bank for such
increased costs. Each Bank agrees to notify the Company of the occurrence of
such an increased cost event promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof.

-28-
<PAGE>

3.5 Funding Losses. The Company agrees to reimburse each Bank and to
-------------- 
hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which the Bank may sustain or
incur as a consequence of: (a) the failure of the Company to make any payment
or prepayment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan
(including payments made after any acceleration thereof); (b) the failure of the
Company to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after the Company has given (or is
deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/
Continuation; (c) the failure of the Company to make any prepayment after the
Company has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.6; or (d) the prepayment
of a Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan on a day which is not the last day of
the Interest Period with respect thereto; including any such loss or expense
arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain
its Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans hereunder or from fees payable to
terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Solely for purposes
of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Banks under this Section
3.5, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have
been funded at the Eurodollar Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the
interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period,
whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan is in fact so funded and (ii) each CD
Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the Certificate
of Deposit Rate used in determining the CD Rate for such CD Rate Loan by the
issuance of its certificate of deposit in a comparable amount and for a
comparable period, whether or not such CD Rate Loan is in fact so funded. This
covenant shall survive the payment in full of all other Obligations.

3.6 Inability to Determine Rates. If any two Reference Banks shall
---------------------------- 
have determined that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan, or if the Requisite
Banks advise the Agent in writing that the Eurodollar Rate or the CD Rate
applicable for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Banks of funding such Loan, the Agent will forthwith give notice of
such determination to the Company and each Bank. Thereafter, the obligation of
the Banks to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, as the
case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until the Agent upon the instruction
of the Requisite Banks revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such

-29-
<PAGE>

notice, the Company may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/
Continuation then submitted by it. If the Company does not revoke such notice
with respect to Loans, the Banks shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as
proposed by the Company, in the amount specified in the applicable notice
submitted by the Company, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued
as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, as
applicable.

3.7 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Company in this
-------- 
Section 3 shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

5.2 Good Standing. The Company and, except for changes in the
------------- 
ordinary course of business or as permitted or contemplated by this Agreement,
each Material Subsidiary is in good standing wherever necessary to carry on its
present business and operations, except in jurisdictions in which the failure to
be in good standing has or will have no Material Adverse Effect.

5.3 Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in the immediately succeeding
------------ 
sentence and except for changes in the ordinary course of business or as
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, Schedule 5.3 hereto correctly sets
forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation and ownership interest of the
Company in each of its Material Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Except as
identified on Schedule 5.3 hereto and except

-33-
<PAGE>

for changes in the ordinary course of business or as permitted or contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company has no subsidiaries the book value of whose
assets as at December 31, 1993, exceed $1,000,000 or, when considered in the
aggregate with all other subsidiaries not listed on Schedule 5.3 hereto
constitute an amount in excess of $4,000,000.

5.4 Authorization of Borrowing. The execution, delivery and

any material order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of

-34-
<PAGE>

5.8 Financial Condition. The Company has heretofore delivered to the
------------------- 
Banks a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 and related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders' equity and changes in financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for such fiscal year, audited by Price Waterhouse. All
such statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the
date thereof and the consolidated results of operations and statement of cash
flow of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the period then ended. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material Contingent Obligation,
liability for taxes or long-term lease which as of the date of this Agreement,
individually or in the aggregate, would, if it became absolute, result in a
Material Adverse Effect which is not reflected in the foregoing statements or in
the notes thereto.

5.9 Changes, Etc. Since December 31, 1993, there has been no event or
------------ 
events that have, either individually or in the aggregate, resulted in a
Material Adverse Effect.

5.10 Title to Properties. The Company and its Subsidiaries have 
------------------- 
good, sufficient and legal title to all the properties and assets reflected
in the consolidated balance sheet referred to in Section 5.8 except as set forth
in said balance sheet or in the notes thereto, except for assets acquired or
disposed of in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise permitted by this
Agreement since December 31, 1993.

5.11 Litigation; Adverse Facts. There is no action, suit,
------------------------- 
proceeding or arbitration (whether or not purportedly on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) at law or in equity or before or by any Federal,
state, municipal or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau,
agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Company's or such Subsidiaries' properties which, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company and its executive officers (assuming
adverse determination of facts which the Company in good faith believes it would
not successfully prove, and considering damages which in their best judgment is
the maximum that would be awarded upon, and the likelihood of, an adverse
determination of the claim or the amount which reflects their best judgment as
to that required to be paid to settle the claims) would result in a Material
Adverse Effect and there is no basis known to such executive officers for any
such action, suit or proceeding. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is (i) in violation of any applicable law which

-35-
<PAGE>

the Loan Commitment of each Bank to make Loans to be terminated, whereupon such
Loan Commitments shall forthwith be terminated; (b) declare the unpaid principal
amount of all outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and
all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to
be immediately due and payable; without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Company; and
(c) exercise on behalf of itself and the Banks all rights and remedies available
to it and the Banks under the Loan Documents or applicable law; provided,
-------- 
however, that upon the occurrence of any event specified in paragraph (f) or (g)
- ------- 
of Section 8.1 above (in the case of clause (ii) of paragraph (f) upon the
expiration of the 45-day period mentioned therein), the obligation of each Bank
to make Loans shall automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of
all outstanding Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall
automatically become due and payable without further act of the Agent or any
Bank.

8.3 Rights Not Exclusive. The rights provided for in this Agreement
-------------------- 
and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
rights, powers, privileges or remedies provided by law or in equity, or under
any other instrument, document or agreement now existing or hereafter arising.

THE AGENT.
--------- 

9.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank hereby irrevocably
----------------------------- 
appoints, designates and authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by
the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agent.

9.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties
-------------------- 
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees
or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

9.3 Liability of Agent. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i)
------------------ 
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to
any of the Banks for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by
the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, or any officer
thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or for the value of any Collateral or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Company or any other party to
any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-
Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained
in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect
the Properties, books or records of the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

-50-
<PAGE>

9.4 Reliance by Agent.
----------------- 

(a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or
other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Requisite Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Requisite
Banks and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all of the Banks.

(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, each Bank that has executed this Agreement
shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied
with each document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Bank for
consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank, unless an
officer of the Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents shall have received notice from the Bank prior to any borrowing
specifying its objection thereto and either such objection shall not have been
withdrawn by notice to the Agent to that effect or the Bank shall not have made
available to the Agent the Bank's ratable portion of such borrowing.

9.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
----------------- 
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except
with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required
to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent shall
have received written notice from a Bank or the Company referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks and the Transfer
and Administration Agent. The Agent shall take such action with

-51-
<PAGE>

respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be requested by the
Requisite Banks in accordance with Section 8; provided, however, that unless and
-------- ------- 
until the Agent shall have received any such request, the Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the
best interest of the Banks.

9.6 Credit Decision. Each Bank expressly acknowledges that none of
--------------- 
the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it and that
no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to
the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the
transactions contemplated thereby, and made its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and extend credit to the Company hereunder. Each Bank also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent,
the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any
credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Company which
may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

9.7 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
--------------- 
hereby shall be consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-
Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company and
without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the repayment
of the Loans and the termination or resignation of the related Agent) be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person any way

-52-
<PAGE>

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with
any of the foregoing; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the
-------- ------- 
payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence
or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall
reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-
pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel and the allocated cost
of in-house counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other
Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein to the
extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Internal
Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or
other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly withhold tax
from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank (because the appropriate
form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Bank failed
to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason)
such Bank shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or
indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to
the Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses (including
fees and expenses of counsel and the allocated cost of in-house counsel). The
obligation of the Banks in this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations hereunder.

9.8 Agent in Individual Capacity. Bank of America and its Affiliates
---------------------------- 
may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits
from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust, financial advisory or other business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Agent
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks. With respect to its
Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

-53-
<PAGE>

9.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may, and at the request of the
--------------- 
Requisite Banks shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks. If
the Agent shall resign as Agent under this Agreement, the Requisite Banks shall
appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks which successor
agent shall be approved by the Company. If no successor agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Company, a successor agent from
among the Banks. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent
hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Section 9 and Sections 10.4 and 10.15 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
under this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent
by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation,
the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Requisite Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for
above.

SECTION 10.

MISCELLANEOUS.
------------- 

10.1 Sales of Participations. (a) Upon advance written notice
----------------------- 
to the Company, each Bank shall have the right at any time to sell or otherwise
transfer participations in all or any part of the Loans and any Notes, to one or
more Affiliates of such Bank or to one or more commercial banks, merchant banks,
savings and loan associations or (with the consent of the Company) any other
institution (a "Participant"); provided that any such disposition shall be in a
-------- 
minimum amount of $5,000,000 and such Bank shall concurrently with any sale of a
participation herein sell a ratable participation in the 364-Day Facility and
the Transfer and Administration Agreement and thereafter cause any such
participation herein to remain ratable with such participation in the Transfer
and Administration Agreement. The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that
any such disposition will give rise to a direct obligation of the Company to the
Participant and the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections
3.1, 3.4 and 10.15 as if it were a "Bank"; provided further, that in the case of
-------- ------- 
a participation, (i) the Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain

-54-
<PAGE>

unchanged, (ii) the Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of
such obligations, (iii) the Company and the Agent shall continue to deal solely
and directly with the Bank in connection with the Bank's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, and (iv) no Bank shall transfer or grant any participating
interest under which the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment
to, or any consent or waiver with respect to this Agreement except to the extent
such amendment, consent or waiver would require unanimous consent as described
in the first proviso to Section 10.8. In the case of any such participation, the
Participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement, or any of the other
Loan Documents, and all amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be
determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation, except that if
amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been
declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in
respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to
the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement.

(b) Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and
exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information provided to
it by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or by the Agent on such
Company's or Subsidiary's behalf, in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such
information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant to the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, the 364-Day Facility and the Transfer and
Adminstration Agreement; except to the extent such information (i) was or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure
by the Bank, or (ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Company, provided that such source is not bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Company known to the Bank; provided, however,
-------- -------
that any Bank may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to
any requirement of any Governmental Person to which the Bank is subject or in
connection with an examination of such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant
to subpoena or other court process and when required to do so in accordance with
the provisions of any applicable Governmental Rule; provided, that a Bank shall
-------- 
disclose only the information required by such request and shall notify the
Company in advance of such disclosure so that the Company may seek an
appropriate protective order, and (C) to such Bank's independent auditors and
other professional advisors provided such Persons are obligated to keep such
information

-55-
<PAGE>

confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company authorizes each Bank to
disclose to any Participant and to any prospective Participant, such financial
and other information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries which has been delivered to Agent or the Banks pursuant to this
Agreement or which has been delivered to the Agent or the Banks by the Company
in connection with the Banks' credit evaluation of the Company prior to entering
into this Agreement; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, such
--------
Participant agrees in writing to such Bank to keep such information confidential
to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder.

10.2 Survival of Warranties and of Certain Agreements. (a) All 
------------------------------------------------ 
agreements, representations and warranties made herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the making of the Loans hereunder and
the execution and delivery of any Notes.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to
the contrary, the agreements of the Company set forth in Sections 2.9, 3, 10.4
and 10.15 and the agreements of the Banks set forth in Sections 2.13, 9, 10.1(b)
and 10.5 shall survive the payment of the Obligations by the Company and the
termination of this Agreement.

10.3 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No
----------------------------------------------------- 
failure or delay on the part of any Bank or any holder of any Note in the
exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall
impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any
default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of
any other right, power or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement or any Notes are cumulative to and not exclusive of, any rights
or remedies otherwise available.

10.4 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the transactions
----------------- 
contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Company agrees to pay within 30
days after submission of an invoice therefor (a) all the actual and reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of preparation of the Loan Documents and all
the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for the Company (including
without limitation any opinions requested by the Banks as to any legal matters
arising hereunder), and of the Company's performance of and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained therein on its part to be performed or
complied with; (b) the cost of delivering to the Banks any Notes pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement; (c) the reasonable

-56-
<PAGE>

fees, expenses and disbursements of the Agent and the Agent's counsel (including
the allocated cost of Agent's inhouse counsel and staff) in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and administration of the Loan Documents and
the Loans and any amendments and waivers hereto; and (d) after the occurrence of
an Event of Default, all actual and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees of law firms engaged by the Banks and the reasonable
estimate of the allocable costs of counsel in the staff of legal departments of
the Banks and costs of settlement) incurred by the Agent and each Bank in
enforcing any Obligations or in collecting any payments due from the Company
hereunder or under any Notes by reason of such Event of Default or in connection
with any refinancing or restructuring of any Loan Document in the nature of a
"work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

10.5 Set Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted 
------- 
under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of Default (after the
giving of any notice and the expiration of any grace period contained in the
definition thereof), each Bank and each subsequent holder of any Note is hereby
authorized by the Company at any time or from time to time, without notice to
the Company, or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly
waived, to set off and to appropriate any and all deposits (including, but not
limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured
or unmatured but not including trust accounts) and any other indebtedness at any
time held or owing by that Bank or that subsequent holder to or for the credit
or the account of the Company and to apply any such amounts in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.13 irrespective of whether or not that Bank or that
subsequent holder shall have made any demand hereunder.

10.6 Notices. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any 
------- 
notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be
in writing and may be personally served, telecopied, telexed or sent by United
States mail and shall be deemed to have been given upon delivery in person,
receipt of telecopy or telex or four Business Days after deposit in the United
States mail, registered or certified, with postage prepaid and properly
addressed. For the purposes hereof, the addresses of the parties hereto (until
notice of a change thereof is delivered as provided in this Section 10.6) shall
be as set forth under each party's name on Schedule 10.6 hereto.

10.7 Severability. In case any provision in or obligation under 
------------
this Agreement or any Notes shall be invalid,

-57-
<PAGE>

illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision
or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.

10.8 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any
---------------------- 
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with
respect to any departure by the Company therefrom, shall be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by the Requisite Banks and the Company, and
acknowledged by the Agent, and then such waiver shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,
-------- 
however, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and
- ------- 
signed by all the Banks and the Company, and acknowledged by the Agent, do any
of the following:

(a) increase or extend any Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate
Loan Commitment, the Aggregate 364-Day Commitment or the Receivables Commitment
or subject any Bank to any additional obligations;

(b) postpone or delay any date fixed for any payment of principal,
interest, fees or other amounts due to the Banks (or any of them) hereunder or
under any Loan Document;

(c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein
on any Loan, or of any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any Loan
Document;

(d) change the Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Loan Commitment, the
Aggregate 364-Day Commitment or the Aggregate Receivables Commitment or of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of any extension of credit which shall be
required for the Banks or any of them to take any action hereunder;

(e) amend this Section 10.8 or Section 2.13;

(f) amend Section 2.1, the definitions of "Pro Rata Share" or
"Requisite Banks;" or

(g) discharge any Guarantor;

provided further, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall (i) unless in
- -------- ------- 
writing and signed by the Agent in addition to the Requisite Banks or all the
Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under any
Loan Document; or (ii) have the effect of making any Bank's Loan Commitment,
364-Day Commitment or Receivables Commitment be nonratable with its

-58-
<PAGE>

Receivables Commitment and its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Unpaids (as
defined in the Transfer and Administration Agreement). No notice to or demand on
the Company in any case shall entitle the Company to any other or further notice
or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any amendment, modification,
termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this Section 10.8
shall be binding upon each holder of any Notes at the time outstanding, each
future holder of the Notes and, if signed by the Company, on the Company.

10.9 Obligations Several. The obligation of each Bank hereunder 
------------------- 
is several, and no Bank shall be responsible for any obligation or
commitment of any other Bank hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement and
no action taken by Banks pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute Banks to
be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or another entity.

10.10 Certain Changes. If (a) any changes in accounting principles
--------------- 
from those used in the preparation of the financial statements referred to in
Section 5.8 hereafter occasioned by the promulgation of rules, regulations,
pronouncements and opinions by or requested by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board or the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts (or
successors thereto or agencies with similar functions) result in a change in the
method of calculation of financial covenants, standards or terms found in
Sections 1, 6 and 7, or (b) the Company changes the manner in which its fiscal
year, fiscal quarters and fiscal months are determined, the parties hereto agree
to enter into negotiations in order to amend the appropriate provisions of this
Agreement so as to equitably reflect such changes with the desired result that
the criteria for evaluating the Company's financial condition and operations or
establishing limitations hereunder shall be the same after such changes as if
such changes had not been made.

10.11 Headings. Section headings in this Agreement are included
-------- 
herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this
Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

10.12 Applicable Law. (a) This Agreement, any Notes and the other
-------------- 
Loan Documents shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to
conflicts of laws principles.

(b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and
any other Loan Documents may be brought in the courts of the State of California
or of the United States

-59-
<PAGE>

for the Central District of California, and by execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of the Company, the Agent and the Banks consents, for itself and
in respect of its property, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.
Each of the Company, the Agent and the Banks irrevocably waives any objection,
including any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum
non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any action
or proceeding in such jurisdiction in respect of this Agreement or any document
related hereto. The Company, the Agent and the Banks each waive personal service
of any summons, complaint or other process, which may be made by any other means
permitted by California law.

10.13 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall
---------------------- 
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Agent and each Bank. No Bank may assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Company and the Agent. No assignment or transfer of any Bank
will be permitted if such assignment or transfer would result in any Bank's Pro
Rata Share hereunder being a different percentage than its pro rata share of its
Aggregate 364-Day Commitment or the Total Outstanding Investment.

10.14 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments, waivers,
------------ 
consents, or supplements may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

10.15 Indemnity. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
--------- 
are consummated, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Agent-Related Persons,
and each Bank and each of its respective officers, directors, employees,
counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless
------------------ 
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements
(including reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel and the
allocated cost of internal counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may
at any time (including at any time following repayment of the Loans and the
termination, resignation or replacement of the Agent or replacement of any Bank)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person arising out of
this Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, or the

-60-
<PAGE>

transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted by any such
Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect
to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any proceeding of the
type referred to in Section 8.1(f) or (g) or appellate proceeding) related to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Loans or the use of the proceeds thereof,
whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that the Company shall
----------------------- --------
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section shall
survive payment of all other Obligations.

-61-
<PAGE>

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be duly executed and delivered by their proper and duly authorized officers as
of the day and year first above written.

THE COMMITMENTS.

all advances under the Multi-Year Facility shall not exceed the Aggregate
Multi-Year Commitment; and the amount of the Total Outstanding Investment

<PAGE>

2.2 Loan Accounts and Notes. (a) Subject to Section 2.2(b), the
----------------------- 
Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced by one or more loan accounts
maintained by such Bank in the ordinary course of business. The loan accounts
or records maintained by the Agent and each Bank shall be conclusive absent

so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Company
hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans.

(b) Upon the written request of any Bank made through the Agent, the
Loans made by such Bank may be evidenced by one or more Notes, instead of loan
accounts. Each such Bank shall endorse on the schedules annexed to its Note(s),

consist of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, and (D) in
the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans and CD Rate Loans, the requested Interest
Period. Base Rate Loans made on any Funding Date shall be in an aggregate
minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of
that amount. Eurodollar Rate Loans and CD Rate Loans made on any Funding Date
shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
$500,000 in excess of that amount.

- 15 -
<PAGE>

(b) Promptly (and normally within two hours) after receipt of a
Notice of Borrowing (or telephone notice in lieu thereof), the Agent shall
notify each Bank of the proposed borrowing. Each Bank shall make available to
the Agent its Pro Rata Share of the amount (if any) by which the principal
amount of the proposed borrowing exceeds the principal amount of the Loans (if
any) maturing on the Funding Date, in same day funds, by remitting such funds
to: Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, ABA No. 121-000-

Gateway Boulevard, Concord, California 94520, no later than 11:00 a.m. (San
Francisco time) on the Funding Date. Upon satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 4.2, the Agent shall make available to the Company on such
Funding Date the aggregate of the amounts (if any) so made available by the
Banks by causing an amount of same day funds equal to such aggregate amount (if
any) received by the Agent to be credited to the account of the Company at such
office of Bank of America. To the extent that Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate
Loans made by the Banks mature on any Funding Date, the Banks shall apply the
proceeds of the Loans made on such Funding Date, to the extent thereof, to the
repayment of such maturing Loans, such Loans and repayments intended to be a
contemporaneous exchange.

(a) The Company may upon irrevocable written notice to the Agent:
(i) elect to convert any Base Rate Loans (or any part thereof in an amount not

thereof) on the last day of any Interest Period therefor; provided, that if the
-------- 
aggregate amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans shall have been
reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of part thereof to be less than
$5,000,000, the Eurodollar Rate Loans and CD Rate Loans shall automatically
convert into Base Rate Loans, and on and after such date the right of the
Company to continue such Loans as Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans shall
terminate.

- 16 -
<PAGE>

(b) Each conversion or continuation shall be made upon irrevocable
telephonic notice to the Agent followed immediately by written notice in the
form of a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation, which telephonic notice must be
received by the Agent prior to (i) 9:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) at least three
Business Days in advance of the conversion or continuation date, if the Loans
are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans; (ii) 12:00 Noon
(San Francisco time) at least two Business Days in advance of the conversion or
continuation date, if the Loans are to be converted into or continued as CD Rate

date, if the Loans are to be converted into Base Rate Loans, specifying: (A)
the proposed conversion or continuation date; (B) the aggregate amount of Loans
to be converted or continued; (C) the nature of the proposed conversion or
continuation; and (D) the duration of the requested Interest Period, if
applicable.

(c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, the Company has failed to select a new
Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans
or type of Loan or if any Default or Event of Default shall then exist, the
Company shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans
and CD Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of
such current Interest Period.

(d) Upon receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Agent
will promptly notify each Bank thereof, or, if no timely notice is provided, the
Agent will promptly notify each Bank of the details of any automatic conversion.
All conversions and continuations shall be made pro rata according to the
respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to which the
notice was given held by each Bank.

(e) Unless the Requisite Banks shall otherwise agree, after the
occurrence of and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, the
Company may not elect to have a Loan be made as, or converted into or continued
as, a Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan.

(a) Reduction and Termination of Commitments. The Company may from
---------------------------------------- 
time to time reduce or terminate the Aggregate Facilities Commitment by reducing
or terminating the Aggregate Loan Commitment, the Aggregate Multi-Year
Commitment or the Aggregate Receivables Commitment in accordance with Section
2.5(c).

(b) Reallocation of Aggregate Receivables Commitment. The Company
------------------------------------------------ 
may, not more than twice each year, reallocate the Aggregate Receivables
Commitment to the Aggregate Loan Commitment and/or the Aggregate Multi-Year
Commitment in accordance with Section 2.5(c). It may not reallocate the
Aggregate Loan Commitment or the Aggregate Multi-Year Commitment to each other
or to the Aggregate Receivables Commitment.

(c) General. The Company shall give not less than three Business
------- 
Days' prior written notice to the Agent (and the Transfer and Administration
Agent in the case of any reduction in the Aggregate Receivables Commitment)
designating the date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of any
termination, reduction or reallocation pursuant to this Section 2.5. Any
partial reduction or reallocation shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of
$10,000,000, and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount.
Promptly after receipt of any such notice (and in no event later than the end of
the following Business Day), the Agent shall notify each Bank and the Transfer
and Administration Agent (such notice, with respect to any reduction of the
Aggregate Receivables Commitment, to be based upon information received by the
Agent from the Transfer and Administration Agent). Any reduction or
reallocation of any such Commitment shall be applied to each Bank in accordance
with such Bank's Pro Rata Share thereof. Any termination or reduction shall be

reduction in the Aggregate Receivables Commitment pursuant to Section 2.5(b).
All accrued commitment fees to, but not including the effective date of any
termination of Loan Commitments, shall be paid on the effective date of such

2.6 Prepayments. (a) Voluntary. The Company may, upon not less
----------- --------- 
than one Business Days' prior written or telephonic notice confirmed in writing
to the Agent (in the case of a prepayment of a Base Rate Loan) or three Business
Days' prior written or telephonic notice confirmed in writing to the Agent (in
the case of a prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan) (which
notice the Agent will promptly transmit by telecopy, telex or telephone to each
Bank), at any time and from time to time prepay (i) any Eurodollar Rate Loans or
CD Rate Loans in whole or in part in an aggregate minimum amount of $3,000,000
and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount so long as the
unpaid balance is not less than $5,000,000; or (ii) any Base Rate Loans in whole

of $100,000 in excess of that amount; provided that in the event of any such
-------- 
prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, the Company shall be
obligated to reimburse the Banks in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.5. If
such notice of prepayment does not specify how such prepayment shall be applied,
it shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before
application to Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, as determined by the
Agent. All prepayments of Eurodollar Rate Loans and CD Rate Loans shall be
applied to the payment of any interest that has accrued to the date of such
prepayment before application to principal. Prepayments of Base Rate Loans
shall be applied to principal only.

Rate plus the Applicable Amount or (ii) CD Rate plus the Applicable Amount or
---- ---- 
(iii) the Base Rate; provided, however, during any period when the aggregate
principal amount of Loans outstanding exceeds 50% of the Aggregate Loan
Commitment, an additional .125% will be

- 19 -
<PAGE>

added to the Eurodollar Rate, CD Rate or Base Rate as the case may be.

(b) Subject to Section 2.8(c), from and after the Effective Date,
interest shall be payable in arrears on the Loans on each Interest Payment Date
applicable to that Loan. Interest paid on the date of any partial prepayment of
Loans hereunder shall be paid in respect of the portion of the Loans so prepaid.

(c) Any principal payments on the Loans not paid when due and, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans not
paid when due, in each case whether at stated maturity, by notice of prepayment,
by acceleration or otherwise, shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand
at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise
payable under this Agreement.

2.9 Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay a commitment fee equal to
---- 
the Applicable Amount on the daily average unused portion of the Loan Commitment
during the Availability Period. The Company shall pay the commitment fee to the
Agent for distribution to each Bank in accordance with its Pro Rata Share. The
commitment fee shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual
number of days elapsed and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each fiscal quarter, for all amounts accrued to such date, and
on the Termination Date; provided that, in connection with any reduction or

termination of the Loan Commitment pursuant to Section 2.5, the accrued fee
calculated on the portion so terminated or reduced for the period ending on such
date shall also be paid on the date of such reduction or termination.

(b) The Company shall pay to the Agent and the Arranger other fees in
accordance with a term sheet dated as of February 2, 1994 from BA Securities,
Inc. to the Company.

2.10 Calculation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest on all Loans and
-------------------------------- 
fees payable under this Agreement shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year and the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it
accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of the Loan
or the first day of an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be included
and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided that, if a Loan is repaid on
-------- 
the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.

(b) Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change
in the Applicable Amount, Reserve

- 20 -
<PAGE>

Percentage or Eurodollar Reserve Percentage shall become effective as of the
opening of business on the day on which such change in the Applicable Amount or
Eurodollar Reserve Percentage becomes effective. Each determination of an
interest rate by the Agent pursuant hereto shall be conclusive and binding on
the Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error.

2.11 Payments by the Company. (a) All payments of principal, interest
----------------------- 
and fees hereunder and under any Notes shall be in same day funds and delivered
to the Agent for credit to:

Bancontrol Account No. 12358-88449
Reference: Mattel, Inc.
1850 Gateway Boulevard
Concord, California 94520

for the account of the Banks or the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (San
Francisco time) on the date due. The Agent will promptly distribute to each
Bank its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein)
of such principal, interest, fees or other amounts in like funds received. Any
payment which is received by the Agent after that time shall be deemed to have
been paid by the Company on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

(b) Subject to the provisions in the definition of "Interest Period",
whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
interest or fees, as the case may be.

(c) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the
Company will not make such payment in full as and when required hereunder, the
Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in full to the Agent on
such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so
required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and
to the extent the Company shall not have made such payment in full to the Agent,
each Bank shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount distributed to such
Bank, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate as in effect for each such day.

2.12 Payments by the Banks to the Agent.
---------------------------------- 

- 21 -
<PAGE>

(a) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank on the
Effective Date or, with respect to each borrowing after the Effective Date, by
12:00 noon (San Francisco time) one Business Day prior to the date of any
proposed borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, or by 9:00 a.m.
(San Francisco time) one Business Day prior to the date of any proposed
borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Bank will not make available to the
Agent as and when required hereunder for the account of the Company the amount
of that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the borrowing, the Agent may assume that each
Bank has made such amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds
on the Funding Date and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made its
full amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds and the Agent
in such circumstances has made available to the Company such amount, that Bank
shall on the next Business Day following the date of such borrowing make such
amount available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate
for and determined as of each day during such period. A notice of the Agent
submitted to any Bank with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.12(a)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made
available, such payment to the Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on the
date of borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not
made available to the Agent on the next Business Day following the date of such
borrowing, the Agent shall notify the Company of such failure to fund and, upon
demand by the Agent, the Company shall pay such amount to the Agent for the
Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the
date of such borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such borrowing.

(b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any date of borrowing
shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on
the date of such borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any
borrowing.

2.13 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If, other than as expressly provided
------------------------- 
elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments on account of
the Loans obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith (a) notify the
Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Banks such participations in
the Loans made by

- 22 -
<PAGE>

them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion
-------- ------- 
of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank, such
purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to
the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount
equal to such paying Bank's Pro Rata Share (according to the proportion of (i)
the amount of such paying Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The
Company agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank
pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the
Company in the amount of such participation. The Agent will keep records (which
shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of
participations purchased pursuant to this Section 2.13 and will in each case
notify the Banks following any such purchases or repayments.

increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.1) such
Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made; (ii) the Company shall
make such deductions, and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

(e) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Company of
Taxes or Other Taxes, the Company shall furnish to the Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to the Agent.

(f) Each Bank which is a foreign person (i.e., a person other than a
United States person for United States Federal income tax purposes) agrees that:
(i) it shall, no later than the Effective Date (or, in the case of a Bank which
becomes a party hereto after the Effective Date, the date upon which the Bank
becomes a party hereto) deliver to the Company and the Agent: (A) if any
Lending Office is located in the United States, two accurate and complete signed
originals of Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or any successor thereto ("Form
4224"), and (B) if any Lending Office is located outside the United States, two
accurate and complete signed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or
any successor thereto ("Form 1001"), in each case indicating that the Bank is on
the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest
and fees for the account of such Lending

- 24 -
<PAGE>

Office or Offices under this Agreement free from withholding of United States
Federal income tax; (ii) if at any time the Bank changes its Lending Office or
Offices or selects an additional Lending Office as herein provided, it shall
with reasonable promptness deliver to the Company and the Agent in replacement
for, or in addition to, the forms previously delivered by it hereunder: (A) if
such changed or additional Lending Office is located in the United States, two
accurate and complete signed originals of Form 4224; or (B) otherwise, two
accurate and complete signed originals of Form 1001, in each case indicating
that the Bank is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of
principal, interest and fees for the account of such changed or additional
Lending Office under this Agreement free from withholding of United States
Federal income tax; (iii) it shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of
any event (including the passing of time but excluding any event mentioned in
(ii) above) requiring a change in the most recent Form 4224 or Form 1001
previously delivered by such Bank and if the delivery of the same be lawful,
deliver to the Company and the Agent two accurate and complete original signed
copies of Form 4224 or Form 1001 in replacement for the forms previously
delivered by the Bank; and (iv) it shall, promptly upon the Company's reasonable
request to that effect, deliver to the Company and the Agent such other forms or
similar documentation as may be required from time to time by any applicable
law, treaty, rule or regulation in order to establish such Bank's tax status for
withholding purposes.

(g) The Company will not be required to pay any additional amounts in
respect of United States Federal income tax pursuant to Section 3.1(d) to any
Bank for the account of any Lending Office of such Bank: (i) if the obligation
to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such
Bank to comply with its obligations under Section 3.1(f) in respect of such
Lending Office; (ii) if such Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form
4224 in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to Section 3.1(f)(i)(A), and
such Bank shall not be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of
United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the Company hereunder
for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in
United States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law
or regulations by any Governmental Person charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date
of delivery of such Form 4224; or (iii) if the Bank shall have delivered to the
Company a Form 1001 in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to Section
3.1(f)(i)(B), and such Bank shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from
deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of
payments by the Company hereunder for the account of

- 25 -
<PAGE>

such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United States law or
regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the official
interpretation of any such law, treaty or regulations by any Governmental Person
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having
the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form 1001.

(h) If, at any time, the Company requests any Bank to deliver any
forms or other documentation pursuant to Section 3.1(f)(iv), then the Company
shall, on demand of such Bank through the Agent, reimburse such Bank for any
costs and expenses (including expenses of outside legal counsel and the
allocated costs of in-house counsel) reasonably incurred by such Bank in the
preparation or delivery of such forms or other documentation.

(i) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank
or the Agent pursuant to Section 3.1(d), then such Bank shall use its reasonable
best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional
payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue if such change in the
judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

(j) The agreements and obligations of the Company contained in this
Section 3.1 shall survive the payment in full of all other Obligations.

3.2 Capital Adequacy. If (a) any adoption of or any change in or in
---------------- 
the interpretation of any law, rule or regulation, or (b) compliance with any
guideline, request or directive of any central bank or other Governmental Person
or quasi-governmental authority exercising control over banks or financial
institutions generally or any court (whether or not having the force of law), or
(c) any change in the force or effectiveness of the regulations set forth at 12
C.F.R. Part 3 (Appendix A), 12 C.F.R. Part 225 (Appendix A), 12 C.F.R. Part 208
(Appendix A) or 12 C.F.R. Part 325 (Appendix A) requires that the commitments of
any Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, commitments and obligations
in respect of Loans) be treated as an asset or otherwise be included for
purposes of calculating the appropriate amount of capital to be maintained by
such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank (a "Change in Law"), the
result of which is to reduce the rate of return on such Bank's capital as a
consequence of such commitments to a level below that which such Bank could have
achieved but for such Change in Law, taking into consideration such Bank's
policies with respect to capital adequacy, by an amount which

- 26 -
<PAGE>

such Bank deems to be material, the Bank shall deliver to the Company a
statement of the amount necessary to compensate such Bank for the reduction in
the rate of return on its capital attributable to such commitments (the "Capital
Compensation Amount"). The Bank shall determine the Capital Compensation Amount
in good faith, using reasonable attribution and averaging methods. The Bank
shall from time to time notify the Company of the amount so determined. Such
amount shall be due and payable by the Company to such Bank ten Business Days
after such notice is given. As soon as practicable after any Change in Law,
each Bank shall submit to the Company estimates of the Capital Compensation
Amounts that would be payable as a function of such Bank's commitments
hereunder.

3.3 Illegality.
---------- 

(a) If any Bank shall determine that any Governmental Rule or any
change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Person has asserted that it is unlawful, for
any Bank or its Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice
thereof by the Bank to the Company through the Agent, the obligation of the Bank
to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Bank shall have
notified the Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such
determination no longer exists.

(b) If a Bank shall determine that any Governmental Rule or any
change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Person has asserted that it is unlawful, for
any Bank or its Lending Office to maintain any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Company
shall prepay all Eurodollar Rate Loans of the Bank then outstanding, together
with interest accrued thereon, or convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of the Bank
then outstanding to CD Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.4,
either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if the Bank may lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or promptly, if the
Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans, together
with any amounts required to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to Section
3.5.

(c) If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans has been terminated, the Company may elect, by giving notice to the Bank
through the Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be made by the Bank as
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be instead CD Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans.

- 27 -
<PAGE>

(d) Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section
3.3, the affected Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with respect
to its Eurodollar Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving
such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be
illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank.

3.4 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. If any Bank shall
--------------------------------------- 
determine that, due to either (a) the introduction of or any change (other than
any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included
in the calculation of the CD Rate or the Eurodollar Rate) in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (b) the compliance with any guideline
or request from any Governmental Person (whether or not having the force of
law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank of agreeing to make
or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans,
then the Company shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand
therefor by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to such
Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Bank for such
increased costs. Each Bank agrees to notify the Company of the occurrence of
such an increased cost event promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof.

3.5 Funding Losses. The Company agrees to reimburse each Bank and to
-------------- 
hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which the Bank may sustain or
incur as a consequence of: (a) the failure of the Company to make any payment
or prepayment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan
(including payments made after any acceleration thereof); (b) the failure of the
Company to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after the Company has given (or is
deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/
Continuation; (c) the failure of the Company to make any prepayment after the
Company has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.6; or (d) the prepayment
of a Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan on a day which is not the last day of
the Interest Period with respect thereto; including any such loss or expense
arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain
its Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans hereunder or from fees payable to
terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Solely for purposes
of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Banks under this Section
3.5, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have
been funded at the Eurodollar Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for
such Eurodollar Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the
interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period,
whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan is in fact so

- 28 -
<PAGE>

funded and (ii) each CD Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have
been funded at the Certificate of Deposit Rate used in determining the CD Rate
for such CD Rate Loan by the issuance of its certificate of deposit in a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such CD Rate Loan
is in fact so funded. This covenant shall survive the payment in full of all
other Obligations.

3.6 Inability to Determine Rates. If any two Reference Banks shall
---------------------------- 
have determined that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan, or if the Requisite
Banks advise the Agent in writing that the Eurodollar Rate or the CD Rate
applicable for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan or CD Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Banks of funding such Loan, the Agent will forthwith give notice of
such determination to the Company and each Bank. Thereafter, the obligation of
the Banks to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, as the
case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until the Agent upon the instruction
of the Requisite Banks revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Company may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/
Continuation then submitted by it. If the Company does not revoke such notice
with respect to Loans, the Banks shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as
proposed by the Company, in the amount specified in the applicable notice
submitted by the Company, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued
as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Rate Loans or CD Rate Loans, as
applicable.

3.7 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Company in this
-------- 
Section 3 shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

5.2 Good Standing. The Company and, except for changes in the
------------- 
ordinary course of business or as permitted or contemplated by this Agreement,
each Material Subsidiary is in good standing wherever necessary to carry on its
present business and operations, except in jurisdictions in which the failure to
be in good standing has or will have no Material Adverse Effect.

5.3 Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in the immediately succeeding
------------ 
sentence and except for changes in the ordinary course of business or as
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, Schedule 5.3 hereto correctly sets
forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation and ownership interest of the
Company in each of its Material Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Except as
identified on Schedule 5.3 hereto and except for changes in the ordinary course
of business or as permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, the Company has
no subsidiaries the book value of whose assets as at December 31, 1993, exceed
$1,000,000 or, when considered in the aggregate with all other subsidiaries not
listed on Schedule 5.3 hereto constitute an amount in excess of $4,000,000.

5.4 Authorization of Borrowing. The execution, delivery and
-------------------------- 
performance of each Loan Document to which it is a party, and acknowledgement of

5.5 No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by the
----------- 
Company of this Agreement and the acknowledgement of the Mattel Sales
Subordination Agreements and the issuance, delivery and payment of the Notes do
not and will not (a) violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
of the Company, (b) violate any provision of law applicable to the Company, or
any material order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of
government binding on the Company, the violation of which would result in a
Material Adverse Effect, (c) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute
(with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any Contractual

5.6 Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and performance
--------------------- 
by the Company of each Loan Document to which it is a party and the

or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any Federal, state
or other governmental authority or regulatory body or other such person.

5.7 Binding Obligation. This Agreement is, and each other Loan
------------------ 
Document to which it is a party, when executed and delivered hereunder will be,
the legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against it
in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws or
equitable principles relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally.

5.8 Financial Condition. The Company has heretofore delivered to the
------------------- 
Banks a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 and related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders' equity and changes in financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for such fiscal year, audited by Price Waterhouse. All
such statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the
date thereof and the consolidated results of operations and statement of cash
flow of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the period then ended. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material Contingent Obligation,
liability for taxes or long-term lease which as of the date of this Agreement,
individually or in the aggregate, would, if it became absolute, result in a
Material Adverse Effect which is not reflected in the foregoing statements or in
the notes thereto.

5.9 Changes, Etc. Since December 31, 1993, there has been no event or
------------ 
events that have, either individually or in the aggregate, resulted in a
Material Adverse Effect.

5.10 Title to Properties. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good,
------------------- 
sufficient and legal title to all the properties and assets reflected in the
consolidated balance sheet referred to in Section 5.8 except as set forth in

- 34 -
<PAGE>

acquired or disposed of in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise
permitted by this Agreement since December 31, 1993.

5.11 Litigation; Adverse Facts. There is no action, suit, proceeding
------------------------- 
or arbitration (whether or not purportedly on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) at law or in equity or before or by any Federal, state,
municipal or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign, pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of the Company's or such Subsidiaries' properties which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company and its executive officers (assuming adverse
determination of facts which the Company in good faith believes it would not
successfully prove, and considering damages which in their best judgment is the
maximum that would be awarded upon, and the likelihood of, an adverse
determination of the claim or the amount which reflects their best judgment as
to that required to be paid to settle the claims) would result in a Material
Adverse Effect and there is no basis known to such executive officers for any
such action, suit or proceeding. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is (i) in violation of any applicable law which could result in a
Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) subject to or in default with respect to any
final judgment, writ, injunction, decree, rule or regulation of any court or
Federal, state, municipal or other governmental department, commission, board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, which could result in a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which provides a reasonable basis for
questioning the validity or the enforceability of any Loan Document.

5.12 Payment of Taxes. All tax returns and reports of the Company and
---------------- 
its Material Subsidiaries required to be filed by any of them have been timely
filed, and all taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges upon the
Company and its Subsidiaries and upon their respective properties, assets,
income and franchises which are due and payable have been paid when due and
payable or bonded against, except to the extent permitted by Section 6.3. The
Company knows of no proposed tax assessment against it or any of its
Subsidiaries that would result in a Material Adverse Effect.

5.13 Agreements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
---------- 
party to or is subject to any material agreement or instrument or charter or
other internal restriction which results in a Material Adverse Effect.

- 35 -
<PAGE>

5.14 Performance. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
----------- 
in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation of
the Company, and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, except, in any such
case, where the consequences, direct or indirect, of such default or defaults,
if any, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

5.15 Governmental Regulation. Neither the Company nor any of its
----------------------- 
Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act or the
Investment Company Act of 1940 or to any Federal or state statute or regulation
limiting its ability to incur Indebtedness for money borrowed.

5.16 Employee Benefit Plans. The Company and each of its ERISA
---------------------- 
Affiliates is in compliance in all material respects with any applicable
provisions of ERISA and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder
with respect to all Pension Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has participated in or participates in any Multiemployer Plan the
withdrawal from which may result in any liability to any party in an amount in
excess of $1,000,000.

5.17 Disclosure. No representation or warranty of the Company
---------- 
contained in this Agreement or any other document, certificate or written
statement furnished to the Banks by the Company since January 1, 1994 for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as of the date
of this Agreement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact (known to the officers of the Company in the case of any
document or fact not furnished by it) necessary in order to make the statements
contained herein or therein not misleading except to the extent that any such
statement or omission that was untrue or misleading at the time made or that
subsequently became untrue or misleading has been superseded or corrected by
information provided to the Banks prior to the date of this Agreement. The
projections and pro forma financial information contained in such written
materials are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by the
Company to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Banks that
such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that
actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may
differ from the projected results. There is no fact known to the officers of
the Company as of the date of this Agreement (other than matters of a general
economic nature) which materially adversely affects the business, operations,
property,

- 36 -
<PAGE>

assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which has not been disclosed herein or in the
written materials referred to in Section 5.8 other than as disclosed in writing
to the Banks on or before the date hereof.

5.18 Mattel Sales Subordination Agreements. Each Affiliate of the
------------------------------------- 
Company with respect to which Mattel Sales has any outstanding obligations on
the date hereof is listed on Schedule 5.18.

SECTION 6.

AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.
--------------------- 

The Company agrees from the Effective Date until payment in full of
all Obligations and termination of the Aggregate Facilities Commitment and the
Transfer and Administration Agreement, unless Requisite Banks shall otherwise
give prior written consent, the Company will perform all covenants in this
Section 6.

6.1 Reporting and Information Requirements. The Company will
-------------------------------------- 
maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain, a system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with sound business practices to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The Company
will deliver to the Agent and to each Bank:

(a) as soon as practicable and in any event not later than 45 days
after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of the Company,
consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of
such period and for the fiscal year to date and the related consolidated
statements of income, consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and
consolidated statements of cash flow all in reasonable detail and certified by
the Chief Financial Officer or the Treasurer of the Company that the
consolidated statements (and to the best of his belief, the consolidating
statements) and other materials required by this clause (a) fairly present the
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates

specifying its objection thereto and either such objection shall not have been
withdrawn by notice to the Agent to that effect or the Bank shall not have made
available to the Agent the Bank's ratable portion of such borrowing.

9.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
----------------- 
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except
with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required
to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent shall
have

- 50 -
<PAGE>

received written notice from a Bank or the Company referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a notice, the
Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks and the Transfer and
Administration Agent. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as shall be requested by the Requisite Banks in
accordance with Section 8; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent
-------- ------- 
shall have received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest
of the Banks.

9.6 Credit Decision. Each Bank expressly acknowledges that none of
--------------- 
the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it and that
no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to
the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the
transactions contemplated thereby, and made its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and extend credit to the Company hereunder. Each Bank also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent,
the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any
credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Company which
may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

9.7 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
--------------- 
hereby shall be consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-
Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company and
without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably from

- 51 -
<PAGE>

and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the repayment
of the Loans and the termination or resignation of the related Agent) be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
action taken or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of
the foregoing; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment
-------- ------- 
to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the
Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses
(including fees and expenses of counsel and the allocated cost of in-house
counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein to the extent
that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Internal
Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or
other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly withhold tax
from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank (because the appropriate
form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Bank failed
to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason)
such Bank shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or
indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to
the Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses (including
fees and expenses of counsel and the allocated cost of in-house counsel). The
obligation of the Banks in this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations hereunder.

9.8 Agent in Individual Capacity. Bank of America and its Affiliates
---------------------------- 
may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits
from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust, financial advisory or other business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not

- 52 -
<PAGE>

the Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks. With respect
to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

9.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may, and at the request of the
--------------- 
Requisite Banks shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks. If
the Agent shall resign as Agent under this Agreement, the Requisite Banks shall
appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks which successor
agent shall be approved by the Company. If no successor agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Company, a successor agent from
among the Banks. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent
hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Section 9 and Sections 10.4 and 10.15 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
under this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent
by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation,
the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Requisite Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for
above.

SECTION 10.

MISCELLANEOUS.
------------- 

10.1 Sales of Participations. (a) Upon advance written notice to the
----------------------- 
Company, each Bank shall have the right at any time to sell or otherwise
transfer participations in all or any part of the Loans and any Notes, to one or
more Affiliates of such Bank or to one or more commercial banks, merchant banks,
savings and loan associations or (with the consent of the Company) any other
institution (a "Participant"); provided that any such disposition shall be in a
-------- 
minimum amount of $5,000,000 and such Bank shall concurrently with any sale of a
participation herein sell a ratable participation in the Multi-Year Facility and
the Transfer and Administration Agreement and thereafter cause any such
participation herein to remain ratable

- 53 -
<PAGE>

with such participation in the Transfer and Administration Agreement. The
Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that any such disposition will give rise
to a direct obligation of the Company to the Participant and the Participant
shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 10.15 as if it were a
"Bank"; provided further, that in the case of a participation, (i) the Bank's
-------- ------- 
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Bank shall
remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the
Company and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Bank
in connection with the Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and
(iv) no Bank shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the
Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or
waiver with respect to this Agreement except to the extent such amendment,
consent or waiver would require unanimous consent as described in the first
proviso to Section 10.8. In the case of any such participation, the Participant
shall not have any rights under this Agreement, or any of the other Loan
Documents, and all amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be determined
as if such Bank had not sold such participation, except that if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared
or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent
as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a
Bank under this Agreement.

(b) Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and
exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information provided to
it by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or by the Agent on such
Company's or Subsidiary's behalf, in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such
information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant to the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, the Multi-Year Facility and the Transfer and
Adminstration Agreement; except to the extent such information (i) was or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure
by the Bank, or (ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Company, provided that such source is not bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Company known to the Bank; provided, however,
-------- -------
that any Bank may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to
any requirement of any Governmental Person to which the Bank is subject or in
connection with an examination of such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant
to subpoena or other court process and 

- 54 -
<PAGE>

when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable
Governmental Rule; provided, that a Bank shall disclose only the information
--------
required by such request and shall notify the Company in advance of such
disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order, and 
(C) to such Bank's independent auditors and other professional advisors
provided such Persons are obligated to keep such information confidential.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to
any Participant and to any prospective Participant, such financial and other
information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
which has been delivered to Agent or the Banks pursuant to this Agreement or
which has been delivered to the Agent or the Banks by the Company in connection
with the Banks' credit evaluation of the Company prior to entering into this
Agreement; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, such
-------- 
Participant agrees in writing to such Bank to keep such information confidential
to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder.

10.2 Survival of Warranties and of Certain Agreements. (a) All
------------------------------------------------ 
agreements, representations and warranties made herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the making of the Loans hereunder and
the execution and delivery of any Notes.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to
the contrary, the agreements of the Company set forth in Sections 2.9, 3, 10.4
and 10.15 and the agreements of the Banks set forth in Sections 2.13, 9, 10.1(b)
and 10.5 shall survive the payment of the Obligations by the Company and the
termination of this Agreement.

10.3 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No
----------------------------------------------------- 
failure or delay on the part of any Bank or any holder of any Note in the
exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall
impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any
default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of
any other right, power or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement or any Notes are cumulative to and not exclusive of, any rights
or remedies otherwise available.

10.4 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
----------------- 
hereby shall be consummated, the Company agrees to pay within 30 days after
submission of an invoice therefor (a) all the actual and reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of preparation of the Loan Documents and all 

- 55 -
<PAGE>

the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for the Company (including 
without limitation any opinions requested by the Banks as to any legal matters
arising hereunder), and of the Company's performance of and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained therein on its part to be performed or
complied with; (b) the cost of delivering to the Banks any Notes pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement; (c) the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of the Agent and the Agent's counsel (including the allocated cost
of Agent's inhouse counsel and staff) in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and administration of the Loan Documents and the Loans
and any amendments and waivers hereto; and (d) after the occurrence of an Event
of Default, all actual and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees of law firms engaged by the Banks and the reasonable
estimate of the allocable costs of counsel in the staff of legal departments of
the Banks and costs of settlement) incurred by the Agent and each Bank in
enforcing any Obligations or in collecting any payments due from the Company
hereunder or under any Notes by reason of such Event of Default or in connection
with any refinancing or restructuring of any Loan Document in the nature of a
"work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

10.5 Set Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
------- 
under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of Default (after the
giving of any notice and the expiration of any grace period contained in the
definition thereof), each Bank and each subsequent holder of any Note is hereby
authorized by the Company at any time or from time to time, without notice to
the Company, or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly
waived, to set off and to appropriate any and all deposits (including, but not
limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured
or unmatured but not including trust accounts) and any other indebtedness at any
time held or owing by that Bank or that subsequent holder to or for the credit
or the account of the Company and to apply any such amounts in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.13 irrespective of whether or not that Bank or that
subsequent holder shall have made any demand hereunder.

10.6 Notices. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any
------- 
notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be
in writing and may be personally served, telecopied, telexed or sent by United
States mail and shall be deemed to have been given upon delivery in person,
receipt of telecopy or telex or four Business Days after deposit in the United
States mail, registered or certified, with postage prepaid and properly
addressed. For the purposes hereof, the 

- 56 -
<PAGE>

addresses of the parties hereto (until notice of a change thereof is delivered
as provided in this Section 10.6) shall be as set forth under each party's name
on Schedule 10.6 hereto.

10.7 Severability. In case any provision in or obligation under this
------------ 
Agreement or any Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

10.8 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision
---------------------- 
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any
departure by the Company therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Requisite Banks and the Company, and acknowledged
by the Agent, and then such waiver shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all
the Banks and the Company, and acknowledged by the Agent, do any of the
following:

(a) increase or extend any Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate
Loan Commitment, the Aggregate Multi-Year Commitment or the Receivables
Commitment or subject any Bank to any additional obligations;

(b) postpone or delay any date fixed for any payment of principal,
interest, fees or other amounts due to the Banks (or any of them) hereunder or
under any Loan Document;

(c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein
on any Loan, or of any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any Loan
Document;

(d) change the Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Loan Commitment, the
Aggregate Multi-Year Commitment or the Aggregate Receivables Commitment or of
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of any extension of credit which shall be
required for the Banks or any of them to take any action hereunder;

(e) amend this Section 10.8 or Section 2.13;

(f) amend Section 2.1, the definitions of "Pro Rata Share" or
"Requisite Banks;" or

(g) discharge any Guarantor;

- 57 -
<PAGE>

provided further, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall (i) unless in
- -------- ------- 
writing and signed by the Agent in addition to the Requisite Banks or all the
Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under any
Loan Document; or (ii) have the effect of making any Bank's Loan Commitment,
Multi-Year Commitment or Receivables Commitment be nonratable with its
Receivables Commitment and its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Unpaids (as
defined in the Transfer and Administration Agreement). No notice to or demand
on the Company in any case shall entitle the Company to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any amendment,
modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this
Section 10.8 shall be binding upon each holder of any Notes at the time
outstanding, each future holder of the Notes and, if signed by the Company, on
the Company.

10.9 Obligations Several. The obligation of each Bank hereunder is
------------------- 
several, and no Bank shall be responsible for any obligation or commitment of
any other Bank hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action
taken by Banks pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute Banks to be a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or another entity.

10.10 Certain Changes. If (a) any changes in accounting principles
--------------- 
from those used in the preparation of the financial statements referred to in
Section 5.8 hereafter occasioned by the promulgation of rules, regulations,
pronouncements and opinions by or requested by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board or the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts (or
successors thereto or agencies with similar functions) result in a change in the
method of calculation of financial covenants, standards or terms found in
Sections 1, 6 and 7, or (b) the Company changes the manner in which its fiscal
year, fiscal quarters and fiscal months are determined, the parties hereto agree
to enter into negotiations in order to amend the appropriate provisions of this
Agreement so as to equitably reflect such changes with the desired result that
the criteria for evaluating the Company's financial condition and operations or
establishing limitations hereunder shall be the same after such changes as if
such changes had not been made.

10.11 Headings. Section headings in this Agreement are included
-------- 
herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this
Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

10.12 Applicable Law. (a) This Agreement, any Notes and the other
-------------- 
Loan Documents shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with, the internal laws of

- 58 -
<PAGE>

the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

(b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and
any other Loan Documents may be brought in the courts of the State of California
or of the United States for the Central District of California, and by execution
and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Company, the Agent and the Banks
consents, for itself and in respect of its property, to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of those courts. Each of the Company, the Agent and the Banks
irrevocably waives any objection, including any objection to the laying of venue
or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens, which it may now or hereafter
have to the bringing of any action or proceeding in such jurisdiction in respect
of this Agreement or any document related hereto. The Company, the Agent and
the Banks each waive personal service of any summons, complaint or other
process, which may be made by any other means permitted by California law.

10.13 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall
---------------------- 
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Agent and each Bank. No Bank may assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Company and the Agent. No assignment or transfer of any Bank
will be permitted if such assignment or transfer would result in any Bank's Pro
Rata Share hereunder being a different percentage than its pro rata share of its
Aggregate Multi-Year Commitment or the Total Outstanding Investment.

10.14 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments, waivers,
------------ 
consents, or supplements may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

10.15 Indemnity. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
--------- 
are consummated, the Company shall indemnify and hold the Agent-Related Persons,
and each Bank and each of its respective officers, directors, employees,
counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless
------------------ 
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements
(including reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel and the
allocated cost of

- 59 -
<PAGE>

internal counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time
(including at any time following repayment of the Loans and the termination,
resignation or replacement of the Agent or replacement of any Bank) be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person arising out of this
Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted by any such
Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect
to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any proceeding of the
type referred to in Section 8.1(f) or (g) or appellate proceeding) related to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Loans or the use of the proceeds thereof,
whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, that the Company shall
----------------------- -------- 
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section shall
survive payment of all other Obligations.

- 60 -

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to

of the day and year first above written.

plus the Discount Reserve to be greater than 80% of the aggregate outstanding
balance of the Eligible Receivables. The Transfer Price (net of any amounts
released from the Collection Account pursuant to Section 2.9(b) to fund all or a
portion of any Transfer) with respect to each Transfer shall not be less than
$5,000,000 and shall be in increments of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each

Transferor. The Agent, on behalf of the Banks, shall accept such offer to
convey, transfer and assign undivided percentage ownership interests in writing.
The terms of each Transfer shall be as set forth herein and in the related
Transfer Notice.

Promptly after receipt of a Transfer Notice, the Agent shall notify
each Bank of the proposed Transfer (such notice to normally be given within two
hours of receipt by the Agent). Each Bank shall make available to the Agent its
pro rata share of the Transfer Price by remitting such funds to the Agent for
credit to NationsBank of Texas, N.A., ABA No. 111000025, Attention: Commercial
Loan Operations, Account No. 0180019828, Ref. Mattel Sales Inc., no later than

Transferor, and the Transferor shall indemnify the Agent and the Banks against
any loss or expense incurred by the Agent or the Banks arising from or relating
to any failure by the Transferor to complete such Transfer including, without
limitation, any loss or expense incurred by the Agent or the Banks by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of funds acquired by the Banks in anticipation
of funding such Transfer.

Each Transfer shall constitute a purchase of undivided percentage
ownership interests in each and every Receivable, together with all Collections
and Proceeds with respect thereto. The aggregate undivided percentage ownership
interest of the Agent, on behalf of the Banks, in the Receivables, together with
all Collections and Proceeds with respect thereto, shall equal the Percentage

shall apply (i) amounts on deposit in the Collection Account pursuant to Section
2.6 or 7.3(h) and (ii) the Percentage Factor of all remaining amounts on deposit
in the Collection Account in the following order of priority: first, in payment
----- 
of the accrued Discount for each Tranche Period, second, in payment of the
------ 
Commitment Fee, third, in payment of any additional Discount due pursuant to
----- 
Section 7.4, fourth, in payment of the aggregate of all other amounts then owed
------ 
(whether due or accrued) hereby by Transferor to the Banks or the Agent (other
than the Total Outstanding Investment), and fifth, in reduction of the Total
----- 
Outstanding Investment. In the event that on any Remittance Date and any day
thereafter, the Aggregate Unpaids have not been paid in full after giving effect

Transferor agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly
execute and deliver all instruments and documents and take all action necessary,
and such other actions as may be reasonably 

19
<PAGE>

requested by the Agent, in order to perfect or protect the Transferred Interest
or to enable the Agent to exercise or enforce any of its or any Bank's rights
hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the Transferor will, in order to
accurately reflect this purchase and sale transaction, execute and file such
financing or continuation statements or amendments thereto or assignments
thereof as are necessary or as may be requested by the Agent in order to
protect, perfect and preserve the Transferred Interest of the Agent, and agrees
to mark its master data processing records and other documents with a legend
describing the purchase by the Agent, on behalf of the Banks, of the Transferred
Interest. The Transferor shall, upon request of the Agent, obtain such
additional search reports as the Agent shall reasonably request. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Governmental Rule, the Agent shall be permitted
to sign and file continuation statements and amendments thereto and assignments
thereof without the Transferor's signature. Carbon, photographic or other
reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement shall be sufficient as
a financing statement. The Transferor shall neither change its name, identity or
corporate structure (within the meaning of Section 9-402(7) of the UCC as in

at the expense of Transferor. As of the date hereof, the Transferor has
instructed the Obligor to cause all Collections to be deposited directly into
the Collection Account and the Transferor shall not change such arrangement
unless the Agent shall have given its prior written consent thereto. If the
Transferor receives any Collections or is deemed to receive any Collections
pursuant to Section 2.6, the Transferor shall immediately remit such Collections
to the Collection Account administered by the Agent for the benefit of the
Banks.

reduced as a result of any defective or returned merchandise, any cash discount
or any adjustment by the Transferor, or (y) reduced or canceled as a result of a
setoff in respect of any claim by any Person (whether such claim arises out of
the same or a related transaction or an unrelated transaction), then within ten
(10) days, either (i) the Servicer shall deliver a Weekly Report evidencing that
the aggregate outstanding balance of Eligible Receivables is at least 125% of
the Total Outstanding Investment and the Discount Reserve or (ii) the Transferor

shall deliver a Weekly Report evidencing that the aggregate outstanding balance

Receivables subject to any such breach of a representation or warranty) is at
least 125% of the Total Outstanding Investment and the Discount Reserve or (iii)
the Transferor shall deposit to the credit of the Collection Account the
outstanding balance of such Receivable in full and the Agent, on behalf of the
Banks, shall be considered to have reconveyed to the Transferor any interest in
such Receivables (including the Transferred Interest therein). The Agent agrees
that it shall execute and return to the Transferor such documents or instruments
as are reasonably requested by the Transferor and necessary to terminate the

SECTION 2.7. Payments and Computations, Etc. All amounts to be paid
------------------------------ 
or deposited by the Transferor hereunder shall be paid or deposited in
accordance with the terms hereof no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on
the day when due in immediately available funds; if such amounts are payable to
the Agent, on behalf of the Banks, they shall be paid or deposited in the
Collection Account, until otherwise notified by the Agent. The Transferor
shall, to the extent permitted by Governmental Rule, pay to the Agent, for the
benefit of the Banks, upon demand, interest on all amounts not paid or deposited
when due to the Banks hereunder at a rate equal to the highest Participation
Rate applicable to any Tranche then outstanding plus 2% or, if no Tranche is
then outstanding, the Alternate Rate. All computations of discount, interest
and all per annum fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360
days for the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last
day) elapsed. Any computations by the Agent of amounts payable by the
Transferor hereunder to the Banks or the Agent shall be binding absent manifest
error. All payments made to the Agent in respect of the Total Outstanding
Investment and Discount shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Banks
pro rata based on their respective Percentages. The Agent shall promptly remit 
- --- ----
to each Bank such Bank's pro rata share of such payments (such payments to 
normally be remitted within two hours of receipt by the Agent).

SECTION 2.8. Reports. At any time the Total Outstanding Investment
------- 
is greater than zero, commencing on the date hereof, and on each subsequent
Monday (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day)
the Servicer shall prepare and forward to the Agent a Weekly Report for the
preceding calendar week, and (ii) such other information as the Agent may
reasonably request. On the second Business Day prior to each Remittance Date,
the Transferor shall provide the Agent and each Bank with a certificate
detailing the amount of Collections expected as of that Remittance Date,
together with the Total Outstanding Investment and the Discount Reserve.

SECTION 2.9. Collection Account. (a) There shall be established on
------------------ 
the day of the initial Transfer hereunder and maintained, in the name of the
Agent for the benefit of the Banks, a segregated account (the "Collection
----------
Account"), at NationsBank of Texas, N.A., bearing a designation clearly
- ------- 
indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the
Banks. 

22
<PAGE>

(The wiring instructions for deposits to such account are: ABA No.
111000025, Account No. 1290154724.) Any interest and earnings (net of losses
and investment expenses) on funds on deposit in the Collection Account shall be
retained in the Collection Account and be available to make any payments
required to be made hereunder (including Discount) to the Agent or the Banks.
On the date on which the Total Outstanding Investment is zero and the Aggregate
Unpaids have been paid in full to the Banks, any funds remaining on deposit in
the Collection Account shall be released to the Transferor in same-day funds.

(b) Close-Out Collections deposited to the credit of the Collection
Account shall be retained in the Collection Account by the Agent until the
earlier of (w) the next succeeding Remittance Date, at which time such amounts
shall be applied pursuant to Section 2.4, and (x) the next succeeding Transfer
Date, at which time the Agent shall release to the Transferor the amount of such
Collections minus the Percentage Factor (as calculated as of the latest Transfer
----- 
Date) of such Collections. In the event that Collections of Close-Out
Receivables are to be applied pursuant to clause (x) above, the Transferor may
request that the Percentage Factor of such Collections be applied toward (i) all
or a portion of the Transfer Price of the Transfer occurring on such Transfer
Date (in which case such amounts shall be paid to the Transferor) or (ii) the
reduction of the Total Outstanding Investment (in which case such amounts shall
be paid to the Banks). In the case of any such reduction of the Total
Outstanding Investment, the Agent shall, in its sole discretion, determine the
Tranche(s) with respect to which such reduction shall be applied; provided
--------
further, however, that in the case of any such reduction of the Total
- ------- ------- 
Outstanding Investment, the Transferor agrees to reimburse each Bank and to hold
each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which such Bank may sustain or incur
as a consequence of such reduction of the Total Outstanding Investment,
including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its funding hereunder or from fees payable
to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. This covenant
shall survive the payment in full of the Aggregate Unpaids.

23
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.10. Deficiency Advances. No Bank shall be responsible for
------------------- 
any default of any other Bank in respect of such other Bank's obligation to fund
any portion of a Transfer hereunder, nor shall the commitment of any Bank
hereunder be increased as a result of such default by any other Bank. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event any Bank shall fail to
advance funds as provided herein, the Agent may, in its discretion but shall not
be obligated to, advance as a Bank all or any portion of such amount (the
"Deficiency Advance") and shall thereafter be entitled to payments on such
- ------------------- 
Deficiency Advance in the same manner and at the same rate(s) to which such
other Bank would have been entitled had it made such advance itself; provided
--------
that, upon payment to the Agent from such other Bank of the entire outstanding
amount of such Deficiency Advance, together with interest thereon, at the
Participation Rate applicable to the related Tranche, then such payment shall be
credited against the Agent's share of the Total Outstanding Investment in full
payment of such Deficiency Advance. Acceptance by the Transferor of a
Deficiency Advance from the Agent shall in no way limit the rights of the
Transferor against the Bank failing to fund its pro rata portion (based on its
--- ---- 
Percentage) of the Transfer Price of any Transfer hereunder.

SECTION 2.11. Adjustment of Facility Limit. (a) The Transferor
---------------------------- 
shall have the right, at any time and from time to time; to terminate in whole
or permanently reduce in part, without premium or penalty, the Facility Limit;
provided that the Facility Limit, as reduced, shall equal or exceed the Total
- -------- 
Outstanding Investment as of the date of such reduction.

(b) The Transferor shall give not less than three Business Days' prior
written notice to the Agent designating the date (which shall be a Business Day)
and the amount of such termination or reduction. Any partial reduction shall be
in an aggregate minimum amount of $10,000,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Promptly after receipt of a notice of such
termination or partial reduction, the Agent shall notify each Bank and Bank of
America National Trust and Savings Asssociation as agent under the Credit
Agreements of the proposed termination or reduction. Such termination or
reduction shall be effective on the date specified in the Transferor's notice
and
24
<PAGE>

shall terminate or reduce the dollar amount of each Bank's Bank Commitment.

SECTION 2.12. Inability to Determine LIBOR. If for any reason the
---------------------------- 
Reference Banks shall have determined that for any reason adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for any proposed Tranche
Period, or if the Requisite Banks advise the Agent in writing that LIBOR for any
proposed Tranche Period does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Banks of funding the Total Outstanding Investment during such Tranche Period,
the Agent will forthwith give notice of such determination to the Transferor and
each Bank. In such event, the Participation Rate with respect to such proposed
Tranche Period and related Tranche shall be determined by reference to the
Adjusted Certificate of Deposit Rate. If for any reason the Reference Banks
shall have determined that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Certificate of Deposit Rate for any proposed
Tranche Period, or if the Requisite Banks advise the Agent in writing that the
Adjusted Certificate of Deposit Rate for any proposed Tranche Period does not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding the Total
Outstanding Investment during such Tranche Period, the Agent will forthwith give
notice of such determination to the Transferor and each Bank. In such event,
the Participation Rate with respect to such proposed Tranche Period and related
Tranche shall be determined by reference to the Base Rate.

- ----------- 
outstanding Tranche shall thereafter accrue as described in this Section 7.4
and/or (ii) terminate the commitment of the Banks to purchase undivided
interests in the Receivables from the Transferor. In the event that any Total
Outstanding Investment remains unpaid on and after any Remittance Date, such

SECTION 8.1. Indemnities by the Transferor. Without limiting any
----------------------------- 
other rights which the Agent or the Banks may have hereunder or under applicable
Governmental Rule, the Transferor hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and the
Banks and any permitted assigns and their respective officers, directors and
employees (collectively, "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
------------------- 
damages, losses, claims, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees (which such attorneys may be employees of the Agent or any one
of the Banks) and disbursements (all of the foregoing being collectively
referred to as "Indemnified Amounts") awarded against or incurred by any of them
------------------- 
arising out of or as a result of this Agreement or the ownership, either
directly or indirectly, by the Agent or the Banks of a Transferred Interest,
excluding, however, (i) Indemnified Amounts to the extent resulting from gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Indemnified Party or (ii)
recourse (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) for
uncollectible Receivables. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Transferor shall indemnify each Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts
relating to or resulting from:

(i) reliance on any material representation or warranty made by
the Transferor or Mattel, Inc. (or any officers of the Transferor or
Mattel, Inc.) under or in connection with this Agreement, any Transfer
Notice, Weekly Report or any other information or report delivered by the
Transferor or Mattel, Inc. pursuant hereto, which shall have been false or
incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed made; or

(ii) the failure by the Transferor to comply with any applicable
Governmental Rule with respect to any Receivable or the related Contract,
or the nonconformity of any Receivable or the related Contract with any
such applicable Governmental Rule; or

(iii) the failure to vest and maintain vested in the Agent, on
behalf of the Banks, an

51
<PAGE>

undivided percentage ownership interest, to the extent of a Transferred
Interest, in the Receivables included in such Transferred Interest, free
and clear of any Adverse Claim; or

(iv) the failure to file by the Transferor, or any delay in
filing by the Transferor, any required financing statements, continuation
statements, or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC of any
applicable jurisdiction or other applicable Governmental Rules with respect
to any Receivable included in a Transferred Interest; or

(v) any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than discharge
in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of any
Receivable included in the Transferred Interest (including, without
limitation, a defense based on such Receivable or the related Contract not
being legal, valid and binding obligation of the Obligor enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms), or any other claim resulting from
the sale of merchandise related to such Receivable or the furnishing or
failure to furnish such merchandise; or

(vi) any failure of Mattel, Inc., as Servicer or otherwise, to
perform its duties or obligations in accordance with the provisions of
Article VI; or

(vii) any products liability claim or personal injury or
property damage suit or other similar or related claim or action of
whatever sort arising out of or in connection with merchandise or services
which are the subject of any Receivable.

SECTION 8.2. Indemnity for Taxes, Reserves and Expenses. (a) If
------------------------------------------ 
after the date hereof, the adoption of any Governmental Rule or bank regulatory
guideline or any amendment or change in the interpretation of any existing or
future Governmental Rule or bank regulatory guideline by any Governmental Person
charged with the administration, interpretation or application thereof, or the
compliance with any directive of any Governmental Person (in the case of any
bank regulatory guideline, whether or not having the force of Governmental
Rule):

52
<PAGE>

(i) shall subject any Indemnified Party to any tax, duty or
other charge with respect to this Agreement, any Transferred Interest, the
Receivables or payments of amounts due hereunder, or shall change the basis
of taxation of payments to any Indemnified Party of amounts payable in
respect of this Agreement, any Transferred Interest, the Receivables or
payments of amounts due hereunder or otherwise in respect of this
Agreement, any Transferred Interest or the Receivables (except for changes
in the rate of general corporate, franchise, net income or other income tax
imposed on such Indemnified Party by the jurisdiction in which such
Indemnified Party's principal executive office or any funding office is
located); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any
such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Indemnified Party or shall impose on any Indemnified Party
or on the United States market for certificates of deposit or the
Eurodollar interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement,
any Transferred Interest, the Receivables or payments of amounts due
hereunder or otherwise in respect of this Agreement, any Transferred
Interest or the Receivables; or

(iii) imposes upon any Indemnified Party any other expense
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses,
and expenses of litigation or preparation therefor in contesting any of the
foregoing) with respect to this Agreement, any Transferred Interest, the
Receivables or payments of amounts due hereunder or otherwise in respect of
this Agreement, the Transferred Interests or the Receivables, and the
result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Indemnified
Party with respect to this Agreement, any Transferred Interest, the
Receivables, the obligations hereunder, or the funding of any purchases
hereunder, by an amount deemed by such Indemnified Party to be material,
then, within ten (10) days after demand by the Agent, the Transferor shall
pay

53
<PAGE>

to such Indemnified Party such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Indemnified Party for such increased cost.

(b) If any Indemnified Party shall have determined that after the
date hereof, the adoption of any applicable Governmental Rule or bank regulatory
guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in
the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Person, or any directive
regarding capital adequacy (in the case of any bank regulatory guideline,
whether or not having the force of Governmental Rule) of any such Governmental
Person, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital
of such Indemnified Party (or its parent) as a consequence of such Indemnified
Party's obligations hereunder or with respect hereto to a level below that which
such Indemnified Party (or its parent) could have achieved but for such
adoption, change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies
with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Indemnified Party
to be material, then from time to time, within ten (10) days after demand by
such Indemnified Party, the Transferor shall pay to such Indemnified Party such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Indemnified Party (or its
parent) for such reduction.

(c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent will
promptly notify the Transferor of any event of which such Bank has knowledge,
occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle an Indemnified Party to
compensation pursuant to this Section. Any notice by the Agent, acting on
behalf of a Bank, claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use
any reasonable averaging and attributing methods.

SECTION 8.3. Other Costs, Expenses and Related Matters. The
----------------------------------------- 
Transferor agrees, upon receipt of a written invoice, to pay or cause to be
paid, and to save the Agent harmless against liability for the payment of,
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys', accountant's and other third parties' fees and expenses, any filing
fees and expenses incurred by officers or employees of the Agent) incurred 

54
<PAGE>

by or on behalf of the Agent (i) in connection with the negotiation, execution,
delivery and preparation of this Agreement and any documents or instruments
delivered pursuant hereto and the transactions contemplated hereby (including,
without limitation, the perfection or protection of the Transferred Interest)
and (ii) from time to time (a) relating to any amendments, waivers or consents
under this Agreement, (b) arising in connection with the Agent's or their
agents' enforcement or preservation of rights (including, without limitation,
the perfection and protection of the Transferred Interest under this Agreement),
or (c) arising in connection with any audit, dispute, disagreement, litigation
or preparation for litigation involving this Agreement (all of such amounts,
collectively, "Transaction Costs").
----------------- 

SECTION 8.4. Reconveyance Under Certain Circumstances. The
---------------------------------------- 
Transferor agrees to accept the reconveyance from the Agent, on behalf of the
Banks, of the Transferred Interest if the Agent notifies the Transferor of a
material breach of any representation or warranty made or deemed made pursuant
to Article III of this Agreement, and Transferor shall fail to cure such breach
within ten (10) days (or, in the case of the representations and warranties in
Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(e), five (5) days) of such notice. The reconveyance
price (which shall be an amount equal to the Aggregate Unpaids) shall be paid by
the Transferor directly to the Agent for the account of the Banks (and not to
the Collection Account) in immediately available funds on such tenth day (or
fifth day, if applicable).

ARTICLE IX
THE AGENT

SECTION 9.1. Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates
----------- 
and appoints NationsBank of Texas, N.A., as the Agent of the Banks under this
Agreement, and each of the Banks hereby irrevocably authorizes NationsBank of
Texas, N.A., as the Agent for such Bank, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such powers as are expressly
delegated to the Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any
fiduciary relationship with any of the Banks, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

SECTION 9.2. Attorneys-in-fact. The Agent may execute any of its
----------------- 
duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall
be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such
duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable
care.

SECTION 9.3. Limitation on Liability. Neither the Agent nor any of
----------------------- 
its officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact shall be liable
to the Banks for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
under or in connection with this Agreement except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates
shall be responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any recitals,
statements, representations or warranties made by the Transferor, the Servicer
or the Guarantor, or any officer or partner thereof contained in this Agreement,
or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or
provided for in or received by the Agent under or in connection with this
Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement, or for any failure of the Transferor, the
Servicer or the Guarantor to perform their obligations thereunder. 

56
<PAGE>

The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any of the Banks to ascertain or
to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement on the part of the Transferor, the Servicer or the
Guarantor or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Transferor, the
Servicer or the Guarantor.

SECTION 9.4. Reliance. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
-------- 
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy or telex
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Transferor, the Servicer or the Guarantor),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement unless it shall first receive advice or concurrence of the Requisite
Banks as provided in this Agreement (or from all of the Banks if so specified
herein) or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
in accordance with a request of the Requisite Banks, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Banks.

SECTION 9.5. Notice of Termination Event. The Agent shall not be
--------------------------- 
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Termination Event or
Servicer Default hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a
Bank, the Transferor, the Servicer or the Guarantor, describing such Termination
Event or Servicer Default. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice,
the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Banks and Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association as agent under the Credit Agreements.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Agent shall take such action to enforce
this Agreement as shall be directed by the Requisite Banks. In the event that
any remedy is

57
<PAGE>

exercised pursuant to Section 7.4 of this Agreement, each Bank and the Agent
shall pursue remedies designated by the Requisite Banks to the same extent as
though such demand was caused by the action of all Banks, and each Bank agrees
to act as expeditiously as possible so as to maximize recovery. Each Bank
agrees that no Bank shall have any right individually to take action with
respect to the Transferred Interest, it being understood and agreed that such
rights and remedies with respect to any portion of the Transferred Interest may
be exercised by the Agent as directed by the Requisite Banks for the ratable
benefit of the Banks.

SECTION 9.6. No Representations. Each Bank expressly acknowledges
------------------ 
that neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates has made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Transferor or the Guarantor, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank
represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
financial condition, creditworthiness, affairs, status and nature of the
Transferor and the Guarantor and made its own decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and to make such investigation as its deems necessary to inform
itself as to the status and affairs, financial or otherwise, of the Transferor
and the Guarantor. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the
Transferor and the Guarantor which may come into the possession of the Agent or
any of its affiliates.

SECTION 9.7. Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent
--------------- 
in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Transferor or the
Guarantor
58
<PAGE>

and without limiting any obligations of the Transferor or the Guarantor so to
do, ratably according to their respective Percentages as then in effect) from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at any
time following the payment of the Aggregate Unpaids) be imposed on, incurred by
or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other document contemplated by or referred to herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall be
--------
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.8. Bank. The Agent and its affiliates may make loans to,
---- 
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Obligor, the Transferor and the Guarantor as though it were not the Agent
hereunder. With respect to its loans made or renewed by it and any note issued
to it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as
any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the
terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include
the Agent in its individual capacity.

SECTION 9.9. Resignation. If the Agent shall resign as Agent under
----------- 
this Agreement, then the Requisite Banks may appoint a successor Agent for the
Banks, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the Governmental Rules
of the United States or any state thereof, having a combined surplus and capital
of not less than $500,000,000, whereupon such successor Agent shall succeed to
the rights, powers and duties of the former Agent and the obligations of the
former Agent shall be terminated and cancelled, without any other or further act
or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement; provided, however, that the former Agent's resignation shall not
-------- ------- 
become effective until such successor Agent has been appointed and has

59
<PAGE>

succeeded of record to all right, title and interest of the former Agent in the
Receivables; provided, further however, if the Requisite Banks cannot agree as
-------- ------- -------
to a successor Agent within ninety (90) days after such resignation, the Agent
shall appoint a successor Agent and the parties hereto agree to execute whatever
documents are necessary to effect such action under this Agreement or any other
document executed pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, in such event
-------- -------
all provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. After
any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this
Article IX shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

SECTION 9.10. Sharing of Payments, etc. The Banks agree that (i)
------------------------- 
with respect to all amounts received by each of them with respect to the
Aggregate Unpaids, whether in the nature of a return of any investment or
discount, or amounts due to a particular Bank in respect of any commitment fees
or facility fees hereunder, equitable adjustment will be made so that, in
effect, all such amounts will be shared among the Banks in proportion to the
portion of the Aggregate Unpaids due each Bank, whether received by voluntary
payment, or by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's lien or secured
claims under the Bankruptcy Code as now or hereafter amended, altered, modified
or replaced, by counterclaim or cross-action or by the enforcement of this
Agreement; (ii) if any of them shall exercise any right of counterclaim, set-
off, banker's lien or otherwise or as adequate protection of a deposit treated
as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receives payment or reduction of
any amounts due to such Bank hereunder, which is greater than the proportion
received by any other Bank in respect of the amounts due hereunder to such other
Bank, then the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (x)
notify each other Bank and the Agent of such receipt and (y) purchase
participations (which it shall be deemed to have done simultaneously upon the
receipt of such payment) in the amounts due hereunder to the other Banks so that
all such recoveries of amounts due hereunder shall be shared by the Banks in
proportion to the amounts due them hereunder; provided that the foregoing
-------- 
provisions shall not apply to any such amount received by a foreign branch,
subsidiary or affiliate of any Bank which is applied by that Bank to the payment
of any

60
<PAGE>

indebtedness of a foreign subsidiary. If all or any portion of such payment is
thereafter recovered from such Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

SECTION 9.11. Independent Agreements. The provisions contained in
---------------------- 
Sections 9.1 through 9.8 and 9.10 of this Article IX constitute independent
obligations and agreements of the Agent and the Banks, and the Transferor and
the Guarantor shall not be deemed parties thereto nor bound thereby. The
Transferor and the Guarantor do acknowledge the rights of the Banks and the
Agent under Section 9.8.

61
<PAGE>

ARTICLE X
GUARANTY

SECTION 10.1. Guaranty of Obligations. For valuable consideration,
----------------------- 
the Guarantor unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees and
promises to pay to the Agent, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United
States and in immediately available funds, any and all present or future payment
and performance obligations of the Transferor hereunder owing to the Agent and
the Banks. The phrase "payment and performance obligations of the Transferor"
(hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Obligations") is used herein in
its most comprehensive sense and includes any and all advances, debts,
obligations, and liabilities of the Transferor, now, or hereafter made,
incurred, or created, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and however arising,
including, without limitation, any and all attorneys' fees, costs, premiums,
charges, or interest owed by the Transferor to the Agent and/or the Banks,
whether due or not due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated,
determined or undetermined, whether the Transferor may be liable individually or
jointly with others, whether recovery upon such indebtedness may be or hereafter
becomes barred by any statute of limitations or whether such indebtedness may be
or hereafter become otherwise unenforceable.

SECTION 10.2. Guaranty Continuing. This guaranty is a continuing
------------------- 
guaranty which relates to any Obligations, including those which arise under
successive transactions which shall either cause the Transferor to incur new
Obligations, continue the Obligations from time to time, or renew them after
they have been satisfied. The Guarantor agrees that nothing shall discharge or
satisfy its obligations created hereunder except for the full payment of the
Obligations with interest as applicable. Any payment by the Guarantor shall not
reduce its maximum obligation hereunder.

SECTION 10.3. Guarantor Directly Liable. The Guarantor agrees that
------------------------- 
it is directly and primarily liable to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks,
that its obligations hereunder are independent of the Obligations of the
Transferor, or of any other guarantor, and that a separate action or actions may
be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor, whether action is brought
against

62
<PAGE>

the Transferor or whether the Transferor is joined in any such action or
actions. The Guarantor agrees that any releases which may be given by the Agent
and the Banks to the Transferor or any other guarantor shall not release it from
this Guaranty.

SECTION 10.4. No Impairment. The obligations of the Guarantor under
------------- 
this Guaranty shall not be affected, modified or impaired upon the occurrence
from time to time of any of the following, whether or not with notice to or the
consent of the Guarantor:

(a) the compromise, settlement, change, modification, amendment
(whether material or otherwise) or partial termination of any or all of the
Obligations;

(b) the failure to give notice to the Guarantor of the occurrence of
any Termination Event or Servicer Default under the terms and provisions of this
Agreement;

(c) the waiver of the payment, performance or observance of any of the
Obligations;

(d) the taking or omitting to take any actions referred to in this
Agreement or of any action under this guaranty;

(e) any failure, omission or delay on the part of the Agent and/or
the Banks to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred in
this Agreement or any other indulgence or similar act on the part of the Agent
and/or the Banks in good faith and in compliance with applicable law;

(f) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets, marshalling of
assets, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings which affect the
Guarantor, any other guarantor of any of the Obligations of the Transferor or
any of the assets of any of them, or any allegation of invalidity or contest of
the validity of this Guaranty in any such proceeding; or

63
<PAGE>

(g) to the extent permitted by law, the release or discharge of any
other guarantors of the Obligations from the performance or observance of any
obligation, covenant or agreement contained in any guaranties of the Obligations
by operation of law.

To the extent any of the foregoing refers to any actions which the
Agent or the Banks may take, the Guarantor hereby agrees that the Agent and/or
the Banks may take such actions in such manner, upon such terms, and at such
times as the Agent or the Banks, in their discretion, deem advisable, without,
in any way or respect, impairing, affecting, reducing or releasing the Guarantor
from its undertakings hereunder and the Guarantor hereby consents to each and
all of the foregoing actions, events and occurrences.

SECTION 10.5. Waiver. The Guarantor hereby waives:
------ 

(a) any and all rights to require the Agent or the Banks to prosecute
or seek to enforce any remedies against the Transferor or any other party liable
to the Agent or the Banks on account of the Obligations;

(b) any right to assert against the Agent or the Banks any defense
(legal or equitable), set-off, counterclaim, or claim which the Guarantor may
now or at any time hereafter have against the Transferor or any other party
liable to the Agent or the Banks in any way or manner under this Agreement;

(c) all defenses, counterclaims and off-sets of any kind or nature,
arising directly or indirectly from the present or future lack of perfection,
sufficiency, validity or enforceability of this Agreement and the security
interest granted pursuant thereto;

(d) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon
an election of remedies by the Agent or the Banks including, without limitation,
any direction to proceed by judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure or by deed in
lieu thereof, which, in any manner impairs, affects, reduces, releases, destroys
or extinguishes the Guarantor's subrogation rights, rights to proceed against
the Transferor for reimbursement, or any other rights of the Guarantor to
proceed against the

64
<PAGE>

Transferor, against any other guarantor, or against any other security, with the
Guarantor understanding that the exercise by the Agent and/or the Banks of
certain rights and remedies may offset or eliminate the Guarantor's right of
subrogation against the Transferor, and that the Guarantor may therefore incur
partially or totally non-reimbursable liability hereunder;

(e) all presentments, demands for performance, notices of non-
performance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of
default, notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence,
creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness, and all other notices
or formalities to which the Guarantor may be entitled; and

(f) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor
hereby expressly waives any and all benefits of (i) California Civil Code
Sections 2809, 2810, 2819, 2825, 2839, 2845 through 2850, 2899 and 3433 and (ii)
California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580(a), 580(b), 580(d) and 726.

SECTION 10.6. Subrogation. The Guarantor hereby agrees that unless
----------- 
and until all Obligations have been paid to the Agent and the Banks in full, it
shall not have any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or contribution as
against the Transferor or any other guarantor, if any, and shall not seek to
assert or enforce the same. Guarantor understands that the exercise by Agent of
certain rights and remedies contained in this Agreement may affect or eliminate
Guarantor's right of subrogation if any, against the Transferor and that
Guarantor may therefore incur a partially or totally non-reimbursable liability
hereunder; nevertheless, Guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers the Agent and
the Banks to exercise, in their sole discretion, any right and remedy, or any
combination thereof, which may then be available, since it is the intent and
purpose of Guarantor that the obligations hereunder shall be absolute,
independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances.

SECTION 10.7. Information. The Guarantor is presently informed of
----------- 
the financial condition of the Transferor and of all other circumstances which a
diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the
Obligations. The Guarantor hereby

65
<PAGE>

covenants that it will continue to keep itself informed of the financial
condition of the Transferor and of all other circumstances which bear upon the
risk of nonpayment. The Guarantor hereby waives its right, if any, to require
the Agent or the Banks to disclose to it any information which the Agent or any
Bank may now or hereafter acquire concerning such condition or circumstances
including, but not limited to, the release of any other guarantor.

SECTION 10.8. Evidence of Obligations. The Agent and each Bank's
----------------------- 
books and records evidencing the Obligations shall be admissible in any action
or proceeding and shall be binding upon the Guarantor for the purpose of
establishing the terms set forth therein and shall constitute prima facie proof
thereof.

66

SECTION 11.1. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate
----------------- 
following the later of (i) the Termination Date or (ii) the date on which the
Total Outstanding Investment has been reduced to zero, all accrued Discount has
been paid in full and all other Aggregate Unpaids have been paid in full;
provided, however, that (i) the rights and remedies of the Banks with respect to
- -------- ------- 
any representation and warranty made or deemed to be made by Transferor pursuant
to this Agreement, (ii) the indemnification and payment provisions of Article
VIII and (iii) the agreement set forth in Section 9.10, shall be continuing and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.2. Waivers; Amendments. No failure or delay on the part
------------------- 
of the Agent or the Banks in exercising any power, right or remedy under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial

---------------------- 
binding on the parties hereto and their respective successors; provided,
-------- 
however, that subject to Section 11.9, no party to this Agreement may assign any

SECTION 11.7. Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees to take normal and

any manner other than pursuant to the terms contemplated by this Agreement;
except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally available to
the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Bank, or (ii) was or
becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the

SECTION 11.8. Characterization of the Transactions Contemplated by
----------------------------------------------------
the Agreement. It is the intention of the parties that the transactions
- ------------- 
contemplated hereby constitute the sale of the Transferred Interest, conveying
good title thereto free and clear of any Adverse Claims to the Agent, on behalf
of the Banks, and that the Transferred Interest not be part of the Transferor's
estate in the event of an insolvency. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
transactions contemplated hereby should be deemed a financing, the parties
intend that the Transferor shall be deemed to have granted to the Agent on
behalf of the Banks, and the Transferor hereby grants to the Agent, on behalf of
the Banks, a first priority perfected security interest in all of the
Transferor's right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables, and
that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.

SECTION 11.9. Sales of Participations. Upon advance written notice
----------------------- 
to the Transferor, each Bank shall have the right at any time to sell or
otherwise transfer participations in all or any part of their pro rata portion
of the Transferred Interest, to one or more Affiliates of such Bank or to one or
more commercial banks, merchant banks, savings and loan associations or (with
the consent of the Transferor) any other institution (a "Participant"); provided
--------
that any such disposition shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and such
Bank shall concurrently with any sale of a participation herein sell a ratable
participation under each of the Credit Agreements and thereafter cause any such
participation herein to remain ratable with such participation under each of the
Credit Agreements. The Transferor hereby acknowledges and agrees that any such
disposition will give rise to a direct obligation of the Transferor to the
Participant and the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of Section 9.10
as if it were a "Bank"; provided further, that in the case of a participation,
-------- ------- 
(i) the Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the
Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) the Transferor and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly
with the Bank in connection with the

71
<PAGE>

Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (iv) no Bank shall
transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant shall
have rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect
to this Agreement except to the extent such amendment, consent or waiver would
require unanimous consent. In the case of any such participation, the
Participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement, or any documents
related hereto, and all amounts payable by the Transferor hereunder shall be
determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation, except that if
amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been
declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of a
Termination Event, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off
in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement
to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement.
