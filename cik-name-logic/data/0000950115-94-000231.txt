with the addition of approximately $45 million of incremental rental revenues
into the Company's national distribution system.'

Commenting on the signing of the agreement, James R. Leininger, M.D., KCI's
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, 'The sale of KCI Medical

our specialty patient surface business and the acquisition and development of
new products and technologies.'
