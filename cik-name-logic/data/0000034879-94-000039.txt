FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Federal-Mogul announces record second quarter earnings and sales 

SOUTHFIELD, MICHIGAN, JULY 20, 1994 . . . Federal-Mogul Corporation
(NYSE-FMO) today reported record net earnings of $20.4 million or $.47 per
common share on a fully diluted basis compared to $15.3 million or $.43 per
common share for the same 1993 period. The 1993 results included a gain of $4.7
million or $.15 per share on the sale of Westwind Air Bearings, Ltd. Record
second quarter 1994 sales of $474.8 million compare to $401.8 million in the
1993 second quarter.

"Our operating margin for the 1994 second quarter increased more than 80
percent over the same quarter in 1993," said Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Dennis J. Gormley. "The Sealed Power Replacement (SPR) automotive
aftermarket business we acquired in October 1993 contributed to this
improvement. We also continue to reduce operating expenses as we consolidate
the SPR facilities. The integration of the SPR business with Federal-Mogul
remains on target to realize $12 million of savings by year-end.

"In addition, cost savings from global sourcing activities and
manufacturing productivity gains favorably impacted margins," he added.

Total aftermarket sales increased 19 percent in the second quarter
compared to the same quarter in 1993, primarily as a result of the acquisition
of SPR and continued growth exceeding 10 percent in international markets. Base
North American aftermarket sales were flat, with increases in core engine
products offset by decreases in suspension products due to supplier capacity
constraints. These supplier issues are currently being addressed and marked
improvements in performance are expected in the second half of 1994.

According to Gormley, the company reported original equipment market share
gains in North America. Continued strength in North American auto builds and
better than expected European vehicle production boosted the company's original
equipment sales.

The company successfully completed the consolidation of its Fuel Systems
Division with its Lighting and Electrical Division in the second quarter. This
involved closing a plant in Lafayette, Tennessee, and transferring the work to
a facility in Logansport, Indiana. Savings from the consolidation are on 
schedule.

Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 1994 were $35.4 million or $.84
per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $22.8 million (including the
$4.7 million Westwind gain) or $.69 per share for the same 1993 period. Sales
for the first half of 1994 totalled $935.1 million compared to $812.3 million
for the same period in 1993.

Headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, Federal-Mogul is a global
distributor and manufacturer of a broad range of precision parts primarily for
automobiles, light trucks, heavy trucks, and farm and construction vehicles.
The company serves both the aftermarket and the original equipment market
providing quality products -- as they are needed -- to customers around the
world. Federal-Mogul operates 31 plants, more than 80 distribution centers and
four major research centers worldwide.

1. EARNINGS PER SHARE

The computation of earnings per share is based on the weighted average 
number of outstanding common shares and common stock equivalents during 
the respective periods, and was therefore impacted by the issuance of 5.75 
million shares of common stock in February 1994 and 6.25 million shares of 
common stock in April 1993. Net earnings used in the computations of 
earnings per share are reduced by preferred stock dividend requirements.
