Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On January 27, 1994, Foodmaker, Apollo Advisors, L.P. ("Apollo") and
Green Equity Investors, L.P. ("GEI"), (collectively, the "Investors"),
acquired Restaurant Enterprises Group, Inc. ("REGI"), a company that owns,
operates and franchises various restaurant chains including El Torito,
Carrows and Coco's. Contemporaneoulsy, REGI changed its name to Family
Restaurants, Inc. ("FRI"). Concurrently, Foodmaker contributed its entire
Chi-Chi's Mexican restaurant chain to FRI in exchange for a 39% equity
interest in FRI, valued at $62 million, a five-year warrant to acquire
111,111 additional shares at $240 per share, which would increase its equity
interest to 45%, and approximately $173 million in cash ($208 million less
the face amount of Chi-Chi's debt assumed, aggregating approximately $35
million). Apollo and GEI contributed $91 million in cash and hold a 57%
equity position in FRI. Management of FRI invested $7 million in cash and
notes and holds a 4% equity position. A portion of the net cash received has
been used by Foodmaker to repay all of the debt outstanding under its then
existing bank credit facility, which has been terminated. It is expected
that the balance of proceeds will be used to reduce other existing debt, to
the extent permitted by the Company's financing agreements, and to provide
funds for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.

Transactions reflected therein.

Each of the Company and each REG Subsidiary (a) has

peaceful and undisturbed possession under all leases to which it is a party as
lessee. All of the leases to which the Company or any REG Subsidiary is a
party are legal, valid and binding and in full force and effect, and no breach
thereof by the Company, any REG Subsidiary or any other party thereto has
occurred or is continuing thereunder. No property or asset, the value of which
is reflected in the balance sheets included in the Financial Statements of the
Company, is held under any lease (other than a capitalized lease) or under any
conditional sale or other title retention agreement. Except for such assets,
plants and facilities as are immaterial in the aggregate to the business of the
Company and the REG Subsidiaries taken as a whole, all tangible assets, plants
and facilities of each of the Company and the REG Subsidiaries are adequate for
the uses to which they are being put or would be put in the ordinary course of

4.19 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

(a) Except where the failure to comply could
not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
each of the Company and the REG Subsidiaries is in compliance with the
provisions of all Environmental Laws, which compliance includes, but is not
limited to, the possession by the Company or the REG Subsidiaries, as
appropriate, of all licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations
required under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof. None of the Company or any of the REG Subsidiaries has
received any communication (written or oral), whether from a Governmental
Authority, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges that the Company
or any of the REG Subsidiaries is not in such compliance where the failure to
comply could, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material

21

Adverse Effect on the Company, and there are no currently existing
circumstances known to the Company that, if not corrected, could prevent such
compliance in the future.

(b) There is no Environmental Claim pending
or to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any
of the REG Subsidiaries or against any Person whose liability for any
Environmental Claim the Company or any of the REG Subsidiaries has retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of law and to the best knowledge
of the Company, there is no basis for any such claim, that could, singly or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

and (b) enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all leases to which it
is a party as lessee. All of the leases to which Chi-Chi's or any Chi-Chi's

SECTION 7. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

7.1 INVESTOR INDEMNIFICATION

(a) From and after the Closing each Investor
shall, without limitation as to time, severally and not jointly, indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and each of the other Investors, their respective
directors and officers, and any person controlling (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), in each case to the fullest extent
lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, assessments, liabilities,
damages, costs (including, without limitation, the costs of preparation and
attorneys' fees) and expenses (including, without limitation, expenses incurred
in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any Proceeding,
whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in which any
Indemnified Party is a party) or Proceeding in respect thereof (collectively,

33

<PAGE>
"Losses" as incurred, relating to or arising out of (i) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Disclosure
Documents or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
which misstatement, alleged misstatement, omission or alleged omission is based
solely upon and in conformity with information relating to such Investor
furnished in writing by such Investor expressly for use in the Disclosure
Documents or (ii) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the representations,
warranties or covenants made by such Investor in any of the Documents, in each
case whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party to any Proceeding;
provided, however, that no Investor shall be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any Losses to the extent that it is finally judicially determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal)
that such Losses arose primarily from such Indemnified Party's willful
misconduct or gross negligence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7.1(a) shall only apply with
respect to Losses incurred on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date, (ii) each Investor shall be liable under this Section 7.1(a) with respect
to any claim only to the extent that the sum of all Losses for which
Indemnification is (or, but for the provisions of this clause (ii) could have
been) sought from such Investor to the date of such claim exceeds $250,000 and
(iii) the aggregate amount of Losses that an Investor shall be required to
indemnify all Indemnified Parties from and against pursuant to this Section
7.1(a) shall not exceed $50 million.

(b) No Investor shall consent to entry of
any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise seek to terminate any
Proceeding in which any Indemnified Party is or could be a party and as to
which indemnification or contribution could be sought by such Indemnified Party
under this Section 7.1, unless such judgment, settlement or other termination
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release, in form and substance
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, from all liability in respect of such
Proceeding.

(c) If the indemnification provided for in
Section 7.1(a) is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses
referred to therein or is insufficient to hold such Indemnified Person harmless
(other than by reason of the limitations set forth therein), then the Investor
providing such indemnification, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a
result of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of such Investor, on the one hand, and such Indemnified Party,
on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or omissions
which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such Investor, on the one hand, and any
Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied
by, such Investor, on the one hand, or such Indemnified Party, on the other
hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent any such action, statement or omission. The
amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to
include any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in
connection with any Proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and
therein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings,
other than those set forth or referred to herein and therein.

9.8 ATTORNEYS' FEES

In any action or proceeding brought to enforce any
provision of this Agreement or the other Documents, or where any provision
hereof or thereof is validly asserted as a defense, the prevailing party, as
determined by the court, shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys'
fees in addition to any other available remedy.

9.9 SEVERABILITY

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or

invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to find and
employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same
result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction.
It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that
they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions without including any of such which may be hereafter declared
invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

9.10 LEGEND

Upon original issuance thereof, and until such time
as the same is no longer required under the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, each certificate evidencing the Shares (and all securities
issued in exchange therefor or substitution thereof) shall bear a legend in
substantially the following form:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. SUCH
SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED,
PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO (i) A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SECURITIES WHICH IS EFFECTIVE
UNDER SUCH ACT, (ii) RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT, OR (iii) ANY
OTHER EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT RELATING TO
THE DISPOSITION OF SECURITIES.

9.11 SURVIVAL

All representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing.

9.12 FURTHER ASSURANCES

Each party hereto agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to obtain all consents and approvals, and to do all other things,
necessary for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to
the Termination Date. The parties agree to take such further action and to
deliver or cause to be delivered to each other at the Closing and at such other
times thereafter as shall be reasonably agreed by such additional agreements or
instruments as any of them may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying
out this Agreement and the agreements and transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

9.13 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY

The provisions hereof have been and are made solely
for the benefit of the parties hereto and each of the Indemnified Parties, and
their respective successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or
have any right hereunder or by virtue hereof.

9.14 EQUITABLE REMEDIES

Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable harm, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law and for
which the ascertainment of damages would be difficult, would occur in the event
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party hereto accordingly
agrees that each other party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement, or any
agreement contemplated hereunder and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof or thereof in any court of the United States or any state
thereof having jurisdiction, in each instance without being required to post
bond or other security and in addition to, and without having to prove the
inadequacy of, other remedies at law.
