Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying supplemental consolidated balance sheets of
Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and
1991, and the related supplemental consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1992. These supplemental consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these supplemental consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

The supplemental consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to
the merger of Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Kentucky Community Bancorp,
Inc. on February 15, 1994, which has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests as described in Note 3 to the supplemental consolidated financial
statements. Generally accepted accounting principles proscribe giving effect
to a consummated business combination accounted for by the pooling of interests
method in financial statements that do not include the date of consummation.
These financial statements do not extend through the date of consummation.
However, they will become the historical consolidated financial statements of
Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries after financial statements
covering the date of consummation of the business combination are issued.

In our opinion, the supplemental consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Trans
Financial Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applicable after financial statements are issued
for a period which includes the date of consummation of the business
combination.

TRANS FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.
NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The supplemental consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. A description of the
more significant accounting policies follows.

Principles of Consolidation

The supplemental consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Trans Financial Bank, N.A. (Bank), Trans Financial Bank of Tennessee, F.S.B.
and Trans Financial Bank, F.S.B. (Savings Banks). Also, see note 3.

Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with 1992 presentations.

Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time
of purchase. If Management has the intent and the Company has the ability at
the time of purchase to hold securities until maturity or on a long-term basis,
they are classified as investments and carried at amortized historical cost.
Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be
held to maturity or on a long-term basis are classified as available for sale
and carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Securities held
for indefinite periods of time include securities that management intends to
use as part of its asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in
response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other
factors related to interest rate and prepayment risk changes. Marketable
equity securities are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value
and unrealized losses are recorded as a reduction of stockholders' equity
unless it is determined that market declines are other than temporary, in which
case, losses are recognized in operations. Amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts is recorded by a method approximating level yield which
considers prepayment risks in the case of mortgage-backed securities. The
specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities
sold.

Loans

Loans are stated at the unpaid principal balance. Interest income on loans is
recorded on the accrual basis except for those loans in a nonaccrual income
status. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when in the opinion of
management the prospects for recovering both principal and accrued interest are
considered doubtful. Unearned income, arising principally from consumer
installment loans or the deferral of certain loan fees, is recognized as income
using a method that approximates the interest method.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale

Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value
as determined by outstanding loan commitments from investors or current yield
requirements calculated on the aggregate loan basis.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that adequately provides
for potential losses in the loan portfolio and is based on an evaluation of the
loan portfolio which includes reviews of individual credits, consideration of
past loan loss experience, loan delinquency trends, changes in the composition
of the loan portfolio and the impact of current economic conditions. The
allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and
reduced by net charge-offs.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the term of the
related lease or over the useful life of the improvements, whichever is
shorter. Leasing commitments are insignificant.

Gain or Loss on Sale of Mortgage Loans and Mortgage-Backed Securities

The Savings Banks sell mortgage loans and participations in mortgage loans and
mortgage-backed participation certificates for cash proceeds equal to the
principal amount of loans sold plus or minus market gains or losses. Gain or
loss is recorded at the time of sale in an amount reflecting the difference
between the contractual interest rates of the loans sold and the current market
rate. Additionally, the normal agency (GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC) servicing fee is
used in the capitalization of any excess service fees. When participating
interests in loans sold have an average contractual interest rate, adjusted for
normal servicing costs, which differs from the agreed yield to the purchaser,
gains or losses are recognized equal to the present value of such differential
over the estimated remaining life of such loans. Amortization of capitalized
excess servicing fees is reflected as a reduction of loan servicing income
using the interest method over the estimated remaining life of such loans,
adjusted for actual prepayments.

Loan Servicing Rights Purchased

The cost of loan servicing rights acquired is amortized against service fee
income in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing
revenues.

The cost of loan servicing rights acquired and the amortization thereon is
periodically evaluated in relation to estimated future net servicing revenues.
The Savings Banks evaluate the carrying value of the purchased servicing rights
by estimating the future net servicing income of the rights based on
Management's best estimate of remaining loan lives.

Other Assets

Included in other assets is real estate acquired in settlement of loans and
loans classified as in-substance foreclosure, which are carried at the lower of
cost or fair value minus estimated selling costs, and real estate under
development, which is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Costs relating to holding real estate acquired in settlement of loans are
charged against income as incurred. Costs related to real estate in the
process of development are capitalized.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Income Taxes

Deferred Federal income taxes are provided on certain transactions which are
reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than for income
tax purposes, using the deferred method. The FASB has issued Statement 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes", which supersedes Statement 96, "Accounting for
Income Taxes". The Company currently accounts for income taxes under APB 11,
having elected not to adopt Statement 96 prior to its required effective date.
Statement 109 will change the Company's method of accounting for income taxes
from the deferred method required under APB 11 to the asset and liability
method. Under the deferred method, annual income tax expense is matched with
pretax accounting income by providing deferred taxes at current tax rates for
timing differences between the determination of net income for financial
reporting and tax purposes. The objective of the asset and liability method is
to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets
and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts
are realized or settled. The Company will adopt Statement 109 in 1993 on a
prospective basis in which case the effect of initially applying this new
pronouncement shall be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in the results of operations. The Company expects that
the impact of adopting Statement 109 will not be significant to consolidated
financial conditions or results of operations.

Earnings Per Common Share

Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net income applicable to
common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Fully diluted earnings per share is computed
based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period assuming conversion of the convertible subordinated capital
debentures into common stock and giving effect to the elimination of interest
expense, less income tax effects, related to the debentures from net income.
Net income for both calculations is reduced for dividends on preferred stock.

On December 18, 1992 and December 16, 1991, the Company's Board of Directors
authorized 4-for-3 stock splits effected in the form of a 33.3% stock dividend.
All per share information has been restated to give effect to the stock splits.
The 1992 split has a record date of January 20, 1993 and a distribution date of
February 1, 1993. The weighted average number of shares outstanding after
giving effect to these stock splits were as follows:

(3) MERGER

On February 15, 1994, Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. and Kentucky
Community Bancorp, Inc. merged. Each outstanding share of Kentucky Community
Bancorp Inc. (KCB) common stock was converted into 5.3 shares of Company common
stock, which resulted in the issuance of 1,374,962 shares of Company common
stock. The supplemental consolidated financial statements of the Company give
effect to this merger, which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests. 
Accordingly, financial statements for current and prior periods have been
restated to reflect the results of operations of these companies on a combined
basis from the earliest period presented, except for dividends. Certain
reclassifications of the historical results of these companies have been made to
conform to the current presentation. There were no material intercompany
transactions and no material differences in accounting policies and procedures. 
The Company's consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 1992,
1991 and 1990 have been restated as follows (dollars in thousands, except per
share information):

(4) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On March 26, 1992, the Company acquired First Federal Savings Bank of Tennessee
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, now Trans Financial Bank of Tennessee,
F.S.B., for cash and common stock of the Company. The aggregate costs,
including consideration and acquisition costs, were $11.270 million. The
412,389 shares of common stock issued were valued at $6.0 million. The excess
of costs over the fair value of net assets of $17,000 was recorded as goodwill.
On March 27, 1992, the Company acquired Maury Federal Savings Bank for cash of
$10.989 million. Aggregate consideration and acquisition costs totaled $11.110
million. The excess of the fair value of net assets over costs (negative
goodwill) of $468,000 was allocated to reduce the values assigned to premises
and equipment. On November 27, 1992, this entity was merged with Trans
Financial Bank of Tennessee, F.S.B.

The aggregate fair value of net assets acquired in the above described
acquisitions included the following:

The book value and approximate market value of debt securities at December 31,
1992, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ
from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or
prepay obligations with or without call on prepayment penalties.
Mortgage-backed obligations generally have contractual maturities in excess of
ten years, however, they have shorter expected maturities as a result of
prepayments.

1992 and $822,000 in 1991. The amount of interest income that was recorded for
such loans was approximately $134,000 in 1992 and $526,000 in 1991.

Loans to executive officers and directors and their associates, including 
loans to affiliated companies for which these individuals are principal owners, 
amounted to approximately $20,851,000 at December 31, 1992 and $15,547,000 at

The Company has a $3,000,000 unsecured operating line of credit with an
unaffiliated bank, with an outstanding balance of $600,000 at December 31,
1992. This obligation has the same restrictive covenants as the ESOP loan due
July 31, 1994, as described below.

The advance from the Federal Home Loan Bank is collateralized by Federal Home
Loan Bank Stock and certain first mortgage loans.

(9) LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER NOTES PAYABLE (Continued)

The ESOP note payable due July 31, 1994 is guaranteed by the Company and
enables the ESOP to borrow up to $4.0 million. The related loan agreement has
a number of restrictive covenants, including maintaining capital levels of the
Company, Bank and Savings Banks at least at the minimum levels required by
applicable regulatory agencies; maintaining the Company's risk-weighted
capital ratio, as defined, at not less than 9.25%; maintaining the Company's
leverage ratio, as defined, at not less than 5.25%; maintaining the Company's
annualized return on assets at the date of financial reports required by
regulations at no less than .50%; maintaining nonperforming loans, as defined,
at less than 2.50% of gross loans at the date of required financial reports;
and maintaining on a consolidated basis an allowance for loan losses of at
least .75% of gross loans. The ESOP note payable due July 31, 1996 is also
guaranteed by the Company. The loan obligations of the ESOP are recorded on
the Company's balance sheet with a corresponding amount recorded as a reduction
of the Company's stockholders' equity. Both the loan obligation and the
reduction of stockholders' equity will be reduced by the amount of any loan
repayments made by the ESOP.

The 8.5% Convertible Subordinated Capital Debentures were converted into
415,462 shares of common stock of the Company during January 1992. The
Debentures were convertible at $11.758 per share of common stock. The
unsecured revolving note payable was paid and canceled during 1992. The
secured note payable to bank due January 1, 1992, secured by the common stock
of Kentucky State Bank and Commercial Bank of Dawson, was paid during 1992.

The terms of the secured notes payable include a number of restrictive
covenants, including maintaining minimum capital to asset ratios at the Banks
and a minimum net worth on a consolidated basis. If the terms of the
restrictive covenants are not met, the lender may declare those notes due and
payable. The secured notes are collateralized by all the issued and
outstanding common stock of State National, a subsidiary of Kentucky Community
Bancorp, Inc.

State National has entered into an agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Cincinnati (FHLB) which enables State National to borrow up to $2,228,000.
Advances from the FHLB would be collateralized by certain first mortgage loans
under a blanket mortgage collateral agreement and stock in the FHLB.

On October 30, 1989, KCB made an offer to exchange on 10% subordinated
debenture due December 31, 2009 (new debenture) in exchange for each 25-year
escalating rate debenture due December 31, 2007 (old debenture). The purpose
of the exchange was to restructure KCB's $3,509,000 subordinated
debenture debt and to reduce KCB's total debt service obligations
by a reduction in the interest rate. Effective January 1, 1990, the exchange
occurred and debentures which were not exchanged were called on February 1,
1990. Repayment of these debentures was financed by the unsecured note
payable, due in September 1992. The new debentures are subordinated to all
indebtedness of KCB to financial institutions as were the old debentures.

Preferred Stock (Continued)

Class B Preferred Stock Series 1992, issuable in connection with the Company's
Rights Plan, carries the right to cumulative annual dividends in an amount of
the greater of $6.00 per share or the sum of the Formula Amounts for each
quarterly payment of dividends. The Formula Amount is the Formula Number (133,
subject to adjustment) times cash dividends per common share and the value of
noncash distributions per common share during each quarter. Each share of
Series 1992 Preferred Stock entitled the holder to vote the number of votes
equal to the Formula Number for each share of Series 1992 Preferred Stock held
on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company. The
stock is not redeemable, except in the case of the Company entering into a
consolidation, merger or other share exchange. Series 1992 Preferred Stock
ranks junior to the Company's Class A Preferred Stock. Upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of Series 1992 Preferred
Stock are entitled to receive the greater of $12.00 per share or an amount per
share equal to the Formula Number times the distribution per share to holders
of common shares.

Class A Preferred Stock, 1990 Series carried the right to cumulative annual
dividends at an adjustable rate based on the bond equivalent yield for AA
commercial paper rates. Dividends were payable quarterly. The stock was
redeemable by the Company at $3,000 per share plus accrued dividends. On March
10, 1992, 333 shares were redeemed and on September 13, 1991, 667 shares were
redeemed. Also, other preferred stock consisting of Dawson Springs Bancorp,

Rights Plan

On January 20, 1992, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a
dividend of one Right (adjusted to 3/4 of a right by virtue of the
four-for-three stock split effected December 18, 1992) for each outstanding
share of common stock of the Company (Common Stock). In addition, the Company
will issue one Right with respect to each share of Common Stock that becomes
outstanding between the record date and the earliest of the Distribution Date,
the Redemption Date and the Expiration Date. Each Right, when and if it become
exercisable, will entitle the registered holder to purchase from the Company
one one-hundredth of a share of Series 1992 Preferred Stock, subject to
adjustment. The exercise price with respect to each whole Right shall be $45
(the "Exercise Price"). The description and terms of the Rights are set forth
in a Rights Agreement, dated as of January 20, 1992 (the "Rights Agreement"),
between the Company and Chemical Bank, as Rights Agent.

(10) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued)

Rights Plan (Continued)

Until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with
the Common Stock. The "Distribution Date" is defined as the earlier of (i) the
tenth business day after the first public disclosure that a person or group
(including any affiliate or associate of such person or group) acquired, or
obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
outstanding Common Stock (such person or group being called an "Acquiring
Person"), (ii) the tenth business day after the Disinterested Directors of the
Company (as defined in the Rights Agreement) determine that a shareholder's
beneficial ownership, such beneficial ownership being at least greater than 10%
of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company, has a detrimental effect on the
Company or its shareholders (such person or group being called an "Adverse
Person") (such dates provided in (i) or (ii) above being called the "Share
Acquisition Date") or (iii) the tenth business day after the commencement of,
or first public disclosure of an intention to commence, a tender or exchange
offer for 25% or more of the outstanding Common Stock.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire on
January 20, 2002 (the "Expiration Date"), unless earlier redeemed by the
Company as described below. The number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Rights, and the number of Rights associated with each
share of Common Stock, is subject to adjustment from time to time. The number
and kind of stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights is also subject to
adjustment as provided in the Rights Agreement. If at any time following the
Distribution Date, a Person becomes the beneficial owner of more than 15% of
the then outstanding Common Stock without the prior approval of two-thirds of
the Disinterested Directors or a Person, who is beneficial owner of more than
10% of the then outstanding Common Stock, is deemed by the Disinterested
Directors to be an Adverse Person (such events being called "Triggering
Events"), then the Rights will entitle each holder of a Right to purchase, for
the Exercise Price, that number of shares of Preferred Stock which at the time
of the transaction would have a market value twice the Exercise Price.

At any time prior to the earliest of (i) the close of Business on the tenth
Business Day following the Share Acquisition Date or (ii) the Expiration Date,
the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not
in part, at a price of $.01 per whole Right (the "Redemption Price"); however,
immediately upon the date that an Acquiring Person becomes an Acquiring Person
or an Adverse Person becomes an Adverse Person, and thereafter until the
earliest of (1) the close of Business on the tenth Business Day following the
Share Acquisition Date or (2) the Expiration Date, the Rights may be redeemed
only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors then in office determine that
such redemption is, in their judgment, in the best interest of the Company and
its shareholders.

(11) DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Payment of dividends by the Company's subsidiaries is restricted by national
and state banking and thrift laws and regulations. Also, certain notes payable
described in note 9 include restrictive covenants related to the maintenance of
minimum capital ratios by the Bank and Savings Banks, which effectively
restrict the payment of dividends. At December 31, 1992, retained earnings of
the Company's subsidiaries were approximately $21.9 million, of which
approximately $12.4 million is available as of January 1, 1993 for the payment
of dividends under the most restrictive of the above restrictions.

Certain notes payable described in note 9 include restrictive covenants related
to the maintenance of minimum capital ratios, which effectively restrict the
payment of dividends by the Company. Also, minimum regulatory capital
requirements effectively limit the payment of dividends. At December 31, 1992,
the most restrictive of the covenants limited the payment of dividends by the
Company to approximately $16.4 million.

Cumulative deferred income taxes were a liability of $48,000 at December 31,
1992 and an asset of $519,000 at December 31, 1991. Deferred income tax
liabilities of $568,000 were recorded in connection with purchase accounting
related to the acquisition of Trans Financial Bank of Tennessee, F.S.B., and
arose as a result of the tax consequences for different book and tax bases for
items not reported on the balance sheet, principally tax deferred loan fees.

Stockholder's equity of the Savings Banks at December 31, 1992 and 1991
includes approximately $4,536,000 and $1,590,000, respectively, for which no
deferred Federal income tax liability has been recognized. These amounts
represent an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
Reduction of amounts so allocated for purposes other than tax bad debt losses
or adjustments arising from carryback of net operating losses may create income
for tax purposes only, which would be subject to the then current corporate
income tax rate.

(13) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP Plan) under which the
Company and its subsidiaries will contribute to the ESOP Plan an amount
determined by the respective Boards of Directors at their discretion. The
Company recognized expenses related to the ESOP Plan based on cash
contributions, with such amounts exceeding the amount computed under the shares
allocated method. The interest incurred on the ESOP note payable, the amount
contributed by the Company to the ESOP Plan and the amount of dividends on ESOP
shares used for debt service by the ESOP Plan for 1992, 1991 and 1990 were as

(14) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Company's supplemental consolidated financial statements do not reflect
various commitments and contingent liabilities which arise in the normal course
of business to meet the financing needs of customers. These include
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments
involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity
risk in excess of the amount recognized in the supplemental consolidated
balance sheet. The extent of the Company's involvement in various commitments
is expressed by the contract amount of such instruments.

Commitments to extend credit, which amounted to $199,040,000 at December 31,
1992, are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all conditions
established in the contract are fulfilled. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon,
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a
case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary
upon extension of credit, is based upon Management's credit evaluation of the
customer. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable,
inventory, property, plant, equipment, residential properties, income-
producing commercial properties, marketable securities and interest bearing
time deposits.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
guaranteeing the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees
primarily consist of performance assurances made on behalf of customers who
have a contractual commitment to produce or deliver goods or services. Most
guarantees are for one year or less. The risk to the Company arises from its
obligation to make payment in the event of the customer's contractual default
and is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to
customers. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based
upon management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies.
At December 31, 1992, the Company had $29,290,000 in standby letters of credit
outstanding.

The Company grants commercial loans, real estate loans, consumer loans and
lease financing to customers primarily in the immediate market areas of its
affiliates in Kentucky and Central Tennessee and has a diversified loan
portfolio.

Also, as of December 31, 1992, there were various pending legal actions and
proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted. Management, after
discussion with legal counsel and after consideration of possible recourse to
third parties, believes that the ultimate result of these legal actions and
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the supplemental
consolidated financial position of the Company.

(15) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as
follows: 

<TABLE> 
<CAPTION> 
December 31, 1992 Carrying Fair 
In thousands Amount Value 
-------- -------
<S> <C> <C> 
Financial assets: 
Cash and short-term investments $ 124,522 124,522

Short-term borrowings 26,993 26,993
Notes payable 18,061 18,011
========= =========
</TABLE> 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

Cash, Short-Term Investments, and Short-Term Borrowings

For those short-term instruments, the financial statement carrying amount is a
reasonable estimate of fair value.

Securities

For securities, fair value equals quoted market price, if available. If a
quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted
market prices for similar securities or dealer quotes.

Loans

For certain homogeneous categories of loans, such as some residential mortgage
loans, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for securities backed
by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair
value of other loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Deposits

The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market
deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value
of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the
future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar
remaining maturities.

Notes Payable

Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and
remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt.

<PAGE> 27
TRANS FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.
NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(15) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

Commitments to Extend Credit and Stand-By Letters of Credit

The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged to
enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the
agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For
fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between
current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair value of
letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or
on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations
with the counterparties at the reporting date.

Limitations

The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on
relevant market information and information about the financial instruments.
Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial
instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future
expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of
various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

The fair value estimates are based on financial instruments without attempting
to estimate the value of assets and liabilities not considered to be financial
instruments, such as premises and equipment, the mortgage banking operation
and the like. Accordingly, the fair value estimates do not represent what the
Company is worth on a fair value basis.
