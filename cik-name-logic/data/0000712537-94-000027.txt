FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION
TO BUY BACK UP TO 117,422 OF ITS COMMON SHARES

E. James Trimarchi, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation (NYSE: FCF),
headquartered in Indiana, PA, announced today that the Board of
Directors of First Commonwealth Financial Corporation has
approved a program whereby First Commonwealth will purchase in
the market place from time to time up to a total of 117,422
shares of its common stock to be held and utilized to satisfy
exercises of presently outstanding stock options assumed by First
Commonwealth in connection with the recently completed United
National Bancorporation and Reliable Financial Corporation
acquisitions. Mr. Trimarchi stated that the shares to be
acquired represent approximately .52 of one percent of First
Commonwealth's presently outstanding common shares and that the
purchase program is expected to be completed by April 30, 1995.

By purchasing the common shares now, Mr. Trimarchi stated, a
dilution of the common equity will be avoided if, as and when the
stock options are exercised. First Commonwealth Financial
Corporation is a $2.3 billion western Pennsylvania multi-bank
holding company. It operates through 84 community offices of its
nine partner banks.
