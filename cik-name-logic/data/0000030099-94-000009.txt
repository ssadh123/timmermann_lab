For The Sale of Western Atlas, International Inc.

On January 28, 1994, the Company sold its 29.5% interest in Western
Atlas International, Inc. (WAII) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Litton
Industries, Inc. for $358 million in cash and $200 million in 7 1/2%
notes due over seven years. The following unaudited pro forma
condensed balance sheet as of October 31, 1993 assumes that the sale of
the Company's interest in WAII had occurred on October 31, 1993. The
following unaudited pro forma condensed statement of earnings for the
year ended October 31, 1993 assumes that the sale had occurred on
November 1, 1992. The pro forma financial statements exclude the
equity earnings of WAII and include interest adjustments to reduce
interest expense associated with the use of the proceeds and interest
income on the 7 1/2% notes. 

The pro forma financial data are provided for comparative purposes only
and do not purport to be indicative of the results which would have
been obtained if the sale had been effected on the dates indicated or
of those results which may be obtained in the future. The pro forma
adjustments are described in footnotes to the unaudited pro forma
condensed statement of earnings. The estimated gain on the transaction
of $147.0 million is not reflected in the pro forma statement of
earnings. <PAGE>

such corporation, company, partnership, or other business entity, or

(iii) the direct or indirect ownership by Dresser or any subsidiary of

Dresser of not more than five percent (5%), in the aggregate, of any

class of debt or equity security of any corporation, company,

partnership or other business entity engaged in the Defined Business

provided that such security is traded on a national securities exchange

or regularly quoted on NASDAQ, or (iv) the acquisition, ownership,

management, or control of Baroid Corporation ("Baroid") with respect to

businesses currently conducted by Baroid.

The provisions of this Section 13 shall in no event be deemed to

prohibit or restrict in any manner (i) the continued conduct and

operation by Dresser of the business and affairs of Dresser's present

divisions, operations, or subsidiaries or any business which does not

compete with the Defined Business, or (ii) the continued conduct of any

business of Dresser or its subsidiaries utilizing the techniques used

by the Atlas Business (as defined in the Amalgamation Agreement) and
<PAGE>

its subsidiaries not for the purposes of interpretation of hydrocarbon

exploration or development.

In the event that any provision of this Section 13 shall be held

invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction by reason

of the geographic or business scope or the duration thereof, such

invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to the scope or

duration of such provision and shall not affect or render invalid or

unenforceable any other provision of this Section 13, and, to the

fullest extent permitted by law, each provision of this Section 13

shall be construed as if the geographic or business scope or the

duration of such provision had been more narrowly drafted so as not to

be invalid or unenforceable.

14. During the continuance of the non-competition covenant set

forth in Section 13, WAII will offer and provide its wireline services

to Dresser, either directly or as a part of a bid package assembled by

Dresser, in geographical areas in which WAII provides the specific

wireline services requested by Dresser and subject to the availability

of equipment for the period requested, under prices, terms and

conditions which are substantially similar in all material respects to

the prices, terms and conditions offered to others. WAII shall not be

prohibited or restricted, however, from offering and providing such
<PAGE>

wireline services to others, either directly or as part of bid package,

which may be in competition with a bid by Dresser, or assembled by

Dresser. As used in this Section 14, the term "Dresser" shall include

any subsidiaries of Dresser.

15. No party to this Agreement shall make, issue, or release any

public announcement, press release, public statement, or public

acknowledgment of the terms, conditions and status of, the transactions

provided for in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of

the other parties as to content and time of release and the media in

which such statement or announcement is to be made; provided, however,

that in the case of announcements, statements, acknowledgments, or

disclosures which any party is required by law or regulations,

including those of public stock exchanges on which the securities of

such party or its affiliates are traded, to make, issue, or release (a

"Legally Required Statement"), the making, issuing, or releasing of any

such Legally Required Statement shall not constitute a breach of this

Agreement, if such party shall have given, to the extent reasonably

possible, three days' prior notice to the other parties, and shall have

attempted, to the extent reasonably possible, to clear such disclosure

with the other parties. Each party agrees that it will not

unreasonably withhold or delay any such consent or clearance.
<PAGE>

16. All notices, requests, demands or other communications under

this Agreement shall be in writing, and shall be given, either by hand

or telex, telecopy, or other telecommunications device capable of

creating a written record (confirmed by mail) or by mailing, certified

or registered mail with first-class postage prepaid, or by overnight

courier (a) if to Litton, to Litton Industries, Inc., 360 North

other person or place as any of such parties shall furnish to the other

parties in writing.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of

which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument, and

shall be deemed effective on and as of the Effective Date.
<PAGE>

18. No failure or delay in the enforcement of any provision of this

Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such provision, nor shall any

single or partial waiver of any breach of any provision of this

Agreement be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach, and

the failure of a party to enforce at any time any provision of this

Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any right of any such party

to subsequently enforce such provision. All remedies afforded in this

Agreement are provided in addition to and cumulative of every other

remedy provided in this Agreement or by law or in equity (excluding the

remedy of recission, which the parties hereby waive). No breach of any

covenant, agreement, warranty or representation shall be deemed waived

unless expressly waived in writing by the party who might assert such

breach.

19. Dresser agrees that the remedies of Litton, WAI, WRH, and

Western International at law for any breach or violation of any

provision of Section 9 and Section 13 shall be inadequate and that,

in the event of any such breach or violation, Litton, WAI, WRH, and

Western International shall be entitled to injunctive relief in

addition to any other remedy, at law or in equity, to which they may be

entitled.

20. Any dispute between the parties with respect to this Agreement
<PAGE>

or with respect to the Outstanding Issues or the Constituent Agreements

that cannot be promptly resolved by the parties shall be submitted to

mediation. The mediator shall be jointly selected by the parties

involved in the dispute with the mediation to be held in Houston,

Texas. If the parties cannot jointly agree on the selection of a

mediator, or if the mediation does not result in a resolution of the

dispute, the matter shall be submitted to and finally resolved under

the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") by an

arbitrator appointed in accordance with those Rules. The place of the

arbitration shall be in Houston, Texas. The determination by the

arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be

enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees and costs

of arbitration shall be evenly divided between the parties to the

arbitration.

21. To the extent that WAI may designate any wholly-owned

subsidiary to purchase the Shares from Dresser pursuant to this

Agreement, WAI hereby unconditionally guarantees to Dresser the payment

of the purchase price for the Shares set forth in Section 1.

22. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in

accordance with the law of the State of Texas without regard to its

choice of law principles and applicable and controlling United States
<PAGE>

federal law. Any legal action, suit or proceeding in law or equity

arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions

provided for in this Agreement may be instituted in the United States

District Court for the Southern District of Texas or in any Texas state

court in Dallas County or Harris County, and each party irrevocably

submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit

or proceeding. Each party agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a

defense or otherwise, in any action, suit or proceeding, any claim that

it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that

its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the

action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that

the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper, or that this

Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced

in or by such court.

23. The parties agree to take whatever steps are necessary to

amend, modify or waive those positions of the Voting Trust Agreements

dated December 1, 1988, April 18, 1990 and May 14, 1991 ("Voting

Agreements") with respect to the Western International 1988 Restricted

Stock Purchase Plan relating to Dresser's right to appoint a Co-

Trustee, such Co-Trustee's right to vote shares of Class A Common Stock

of Western International, and any other rights Dresser may have under

the Voting Agreements.

person other than the parties and their respective successors and

permitted assigns.

constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the

subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior understandings,

agreements, or representations by or among the parties, written or

oral, to the extent they have related in any way to the subject matter

hereof.

26. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit

of the parties named herein and their respective successors and
