such Lender's name on the signature pages hereof, as such
amount may be reduced pursuant to Section 2.11 (such Lender's
"Commitment"), provided that the aggregate amount of the
Commitments of the Lenders shall be deemed used from time to
time to the extent of the aggregate amount of the B Advances
then outstanding at any time of determination, such deemed use
of the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be applied to

12
<PAGE> 13
the Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments
in effect at such time of determination (such deemed use of the
aggregate amount of the Commitments being a "B Reduction").
The aggregate of all Commitments hereunder on the Effective Date
is $950,000,000. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment,
the Company may from time to time borrow, repay pursuant to
Section 2.08 or prepay pursuant to Section 2.04, and reborrow
under this Section 2.01.

(b) Each A Borrowing shall be (i) in the case of Base
Rate Advances, in an aggregate principal amount of not less than
$5,000,000 or, if greater, in an aggregate principal amount which
is an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (ii) in the case of
Eurodollar Advances, in an aggregate principal amount of not less
than $15,000,000 or, if greater, an aggregate principal amount
which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (except that any
Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances may be in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the unused portion of the Total
Commitments) and shall consist of A Advances of the same Type and
Interest Period, in each case made on the same day simultaneously
by the Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments.

SECTION 2.02. Making the A Advances.
______________________

(a) Each Borrowing shall be made on notice given not
later than (i) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) in the case of an
A Borrowing which is to consist of Base Rate Advances, on the
Business Day of such A Borrowing, and (ii) 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) in the case of an A Borrowing which is to consist of
Eurodollar Advances, on the third Business Day prior to such A
Borrowing, from the Company to the Administrative Agent (which
shall give prompt notice thereof to each Lender). Each such
notice (a "Notice of A Borrowing") shall be by telex or telecopy
facsimile, confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the
form of Exhibit A-1 hereto and shall specify (i) the date of such
A Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the Type of A
Advances comprising such A Borrowing, (iii) the aggregate amount
of the proposed A Borrowing, and (iv) the Interest Period for the
A Advances to be made as part of such A Borrowing. Each Lender
through its Applicable Lending Office shall, before (x) in the
case of an A Borrowing which is to consist of Base Rate Advances,
1:00 P.M. (New York City time), and (y) in the case of an A
Borrowing which is to consist of Eurodollar Advances, 12:00 Noon
(New York City time) on the date of such A Borrowing, make
available to the Administrative Agent at its address provided for
in Section 8.03 such Lender's ratable portion of such A Borrowing
in same day funds. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article V and after receipt by the Administrative
Agent of such funds, the Administrative Agent will make such
funds available to the Company at the Administrative Agent's
aforesaid address.

13
<PAGE> 14

(b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding,

(i) if any Lender shall notify (which notice
shall, if given in relation to a proposed A Borrowing, be
given at least one Business Day before the date of the
proposed A Borrowing) the Administrative Agent that the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of
any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central
bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is
unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office
to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar
Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Advances
hereunder, the Commitment of such Lender to make Eurodollar
Advances shall forthwith be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company that such
Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist and such Lender's then
outstanding Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be converted
to Base Rate Advances; to the extent that such affected
Eurodollar Advances become Base Rate Advances, all payments
of principal that would have been otherwise applied to such
Eurodollar Advances shall be applied instead to such
Lender's Base Rate Advances; provided that if Majority
Lenders are subject to the same illegality or assertion of
illegality, then the right of the Company to select
Eurodollar Advances for such A Borrowing or any subsequent A
Borrowing shall forthwith be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and
each A Advance comprising such A Borrowing shall be
converted to a Base Rate Advance;

(ii) if fewer than two Reference Banks furnish
timely information to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 2.07 for determining the LIBO Rate for Eurodollar
Advances comprising any requested A Borrowing, the right
of the Company to select Eurodollar Advances for such A
Borrowing or any subsequent A Borrowing shall be suspended
until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and
the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension
no longer exist, and each A Advance comprising such A
Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Advance; and

(iii) if the Majority Lenders shall, at least
one Business Day before the date of any requested A
Borrowing, notify the Administrative Agent that the LIBO
Rate for Eurodollar Advances comprising such A Borrowing
will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority
Lenders of making or funding their respective Eurodollar
Advances for such A Borrowing, the right of the Company to
select Eurodollar Advances for such A Borrowing or any
subsequent A Borrowing shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the
Lenders that the circum-

14
<PAGE> 15
stances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each A Advance
comprising such A Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Advance.

(c) Each Notice of A Borrowing shall be irrevocable
and binding on the Company and, in respect of an A Borrowing
consisting of Eurodollar Advances specified in any such notice,
the Company shall, in accordance with Section 2.13, indemnify
each Lender against any loss or expense incurred by such Lender
as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date
specified for such A Borrowing the applicable conditions set
forth in Article V, including, without limitation, any loss
(including loss of anticipated profits) or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other
funds acquired by any Lender to fund the A Advance to be made by
such Lender as part of such A Borrowing when such A Advance, as a
result of such failure, is not made on such date.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by a Lender before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on
the Business Day of the making of a Base Rate Advance and 11:00
A.M. (New York City time) one Business Day prior to the date of
the making of any Eurodollar Advance that such Lender does not
intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such
Lender's portion of the A Advances to be made on such date, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date for the
making of such A Advances and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a
corresponding amount. If such portion is not in fact made
available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the
Administrative Agent shall have made such portion available to
the Company as aforesaid, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to recover such portion on demand from such Lender,
which demand shall be made in a reasonably prompt manner. If
such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify the Company and the Company shall repay
such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such
Lender or the Company, as the case may be, interest on such
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative
Agent to the Company to the date such corresponding amount is
recovered by the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the
Company, the interest rate applicable at the time to A Advances
comprising such A Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
the Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment
hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Company may have
against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender
hereunder.

15
<PAGE> 16

(e) The failure of any Lender to make the A Advance to
be made by it as part of any A Borrowing shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its A
Advance on the date of such A Borrowing, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the A
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any A
Borrowing.

SECTION 2.03. Making the B Advances.
______________________

(a) Each Lender severally agrees that the Company may
make B Borrowings under this Section 2.03 from time to time on
any Business Day during the period from the date hereof until the
date occurring 30 days prior to the latest Termination Date of
any Lender then in effect in the manner set forth below; provided
that, (i) following the making of each B Borrowing, (1) the
aggregate amount of the Advances then outstanding shall not
exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders
then in effect (computed without regard to any B Reduction), and
(2) the aggregate amount of the B Advances scheduled to be
outstanding at any time through the maturity of such B Advances
shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the
Lenders scheduled to be in effect at such time (computed without
regard to any B Reduction), and (ii) no Lender may make a B
Advance if the maturity date of such B Advance occurs after the
Termination Date of such Lender.

(i) The Company may request a B Borrowing under
this Section 2.03 by delivering to the Administrative Agent,
by telecopier, telex or cable, confirmed immediately in
writing, a notice of a B Borrowing (a "Notice of B
Borrowing"), in substantially the form of Exhibit A-2
hereto, specifying the date and aggregate amount of the
proposed B Borrowing, the maturity date for repayment of
each B Advance to be made as part of such B Borrowing (which
maturity date (x) in the case of a fixed rate B Borrowing
may not be earlier than the date occurring 14 days after the
date of such B Borrowing or later than the date occurring
180 days after the date of such B Borrowing, and (y) in the
case of any other B Borrowing may not be earlier than the
date occurring 30 days after the date of such B Borrowing
or later than the date occurring 180 days after the date
of such B Borrowing), the interest payment date or dates
relating thereto, and any other terms to be applicable to
such B Borrowing, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City
time) (A) at least one Business Day prior to the date of the
proposed B Borrowing, if the Company shall specify in the
Notice of B Borrowing that the rates of interest to be
offered by the Lenders shall be fixed rates per annum and
(B) at least four Business Days prior to the date of the
proposed B Borrowing, if the Company shall instead specify
in the Notice of B Borrowing the basis to be used by the
Lenders in determining the rates of interest to be offered

16
<PAGE> 17
by them. The Company may not select a maturity date for any
B Borrowing which ends after the latest Termination Date of
any Lender then in effect. The Administrative Agent shall
in turn promptly notify each Lender of each request for a B
Borrowing received by it from the Company by sending such
Lender a copy of the related Notice of B Borrowing.

(ii) Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion,
it elects to do so, irrevocably offer to make one or more B
Advances to the Company as part of such proposed B Borrowing
at a rate or rates of interest specified by such Lender in
its sole discretion, by delivering a B Advance Offer Notice,
in the form of Exhibit A-3 hereto, to the Administrative
Agent (which shall give prompt notice of receipt thereof to
the Company), before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) (A) on
the date of such proposed B Borrowing, in the case of a
Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (A) of
paragraph (i) above and (B) three Business Days before the
date of such proposed B Borrowing, in the case of a Notice
of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph
(i) above, which notice shall include the minimum amount and
maximum amount of each B Advance which such Lender would be
willing to make as part of such proposed B Borrowing (which
amounts may, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of
this Section 2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment), the
rate or rates of interest therefor and such Lender's
Applicable Lending Office with respect to such B Advance;
provided that if the Administrative Agent in its capacity as
a Lender shall, in its sole discretion, elect to make any
such offer, it shall notify the Company of such offer before
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date on which notice
of such election is to be given to the Administrative Agent
by the other Lenders.

(iii) The Company shall, in turn, (A) before
12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date of such proposed
B Borrowing, in the case of a Notice of B Borrowing
delivered pursuant to clause (A) of paragraph (i) above and
(B) before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) three Business
Days before the date of such proposed B Borrowing, in the
case of a Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause
(B) of paragraph (i) above, either

(x) cancel such B Borrowing by giving the
Administrative Agent notice to that effect, or

(y) accept, in whole or in part (but
not less than the minimum amount indicated by the
applicable Lender) one or more of the offers made by
any Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above
(which acceptance shall be irrevocable) in its sole
discretion, by giving notice to the Administrative
Agent of the amount of each B Advance (which amount

17
<PAGE> 18
shall be equal to or greater than the minimum amount,
and equal to or less than the maximum amount, notified
to the Company by the Administrative Agent on behalf of
such Lender for such B Advance pursuant to paragraph
(ii) above) to be made by each Lender as part of such
B Borrowing (provided that the aggregate amount of
such B Borrowing shall not exceed the amount specified on
the Notice of B Borrowing delivered by the Company pursuant
to paragraph (i) above), and reject any remaining offers
made by Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above by giving
the Administrative Agent notice to that effect; provided
that acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
ascending rates for B Borrowings of the same type and
duration for up to the maximum amounts offered by Lenders;
and provided further that if offers are made by two or more
Lenders for the same type of B Borrowing for the same
duration and with the same rate of interest, in an aggregate
amount which is greater than the amount requested, the
principal amount of B Borrowings in respect of which such
offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Company among
such Lenders as nearly as possible (in multiples of
$1,000,000, as the Company may deem appropriate) on a pro
rata basis based on the maximum amounts offered by such
Lenders at such rate of interest.

(iv) If the Company notifies the Administrative
Agent that such B Borrowing is cancelled pursuant to
paragraph (iii)(x) above or if the Company rejects any
offers made by Lenders pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above,
the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Lenders or affected Lenders, as the case may be, and in
the case of a cancellation, such B Borrowing shall not be
made.

(v) If the Company accepts, in whole or in part,
one or more of the offers made by any Lender or Lenders
pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above, the Administrative
Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each Lender that has
made an offer as described in paragraph (ii) above, of the
date and aggregate amount of such B Borrowing and whether or
not any offer or offers made by such Lender pursuant to
paragraph (ii) above have been accepted by the Company,
(B) each Lender that is to make a B Advance as part of such
B Borrowing, of the amount of each B Advance to be made by
such Lender as part of such B Borrowing, and (C) each Lender
that is to make a B Advance as part of such B Borrowing,
upon receipt, that the Administrative Agent has received
forms of documents appearing to fulfill the applicable
conditions set forth in Article III. Each Lender that is to
make a B Advance as part of such B Borrowing shall, before
1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such B
Borrow-

18
<PAGE> 19
ing specified in the notice received from the
Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding
sentence or any later time when such Lender shall have
received notice from the Administrative Agent pursuant to
clause (C) of the preceding sentence, make available for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative
Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.03 such Lender's
portion of such B Borrowing, in same day funds. Upon fulfillment of
the applicable conditions set forth in Article III and after
receipt by the Administrative Agent of such funds, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the
Company at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.
Promptly after each B Borrowing, the Administrative Agent
will notify each Lender of the amount of the B Borrowing,
the consequent B Reduction and the dates upon which such
B Reduction commenced and will terminate.

(vi) The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's account
an auction fee of $2,500 for each Notice of B Borrowing
delivered by the Company to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.03(a), whether or not a B
Borrowing is made pursuant thereto.

(b) Each B Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount
not less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof and, following the making of each B Borrowing, the
Company and each Lender shall be in compliance with the
limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of
subsection (a) above.

(c) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth
in this Section 2.03, the Company may from time to time borrow
under this Section 2.03, repay or prepay pursuant to subsection
(d) below, and reborrow under this Section 2.03, and more than
one B Borrowing may be made on a Business Day; provided that,
except for B Borrowings made on the same Business Day, a B
Borrowing shall not be made within three Business Days of the
date of any other B Borrowing.

(d) The Company shall repay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender which has made a B Advance,
on the maturity date of each B Advance (such maturity date being
that specified by the Company for repayment of such B Advance in
the related Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to
subsection (a)(i) above), the then unpaid principal amount of
such B Advance. The Company shall have no right to prepay any
principal amount of any B Advance unless, and then only on the
terms, specified by the Company for such B Advance in the related
Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i)
above.

(e) The Company shall pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each B Advance from the date of such B

19
<PAGE> 20
Advance to the date the principal amount of such B Advance is
repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such B Advance
specified by the Lender making such B Advance in its notice with
respect thereto delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) above,
payable on the interest payment date or dates specified by the
Company for such B Advance in the related Notice of B Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above; provided that any
principal amount of any B Advance which is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall
bear interest from the date on which such amount is due until
such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per
annum equal at all times to (A) until the stated maturity date of
such B Advance, the greater of (x) 2% per annum above the Base
Rate in effect from time to time and (y) 2% above the stated rate
per annum of such B Advance, and (B) after the stated maturity of
such B Advance, 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect from
time to time.

SECTION 2.04. Prepayments of Advances.
________________________

(a) The Company shall have no right to prepay any
principal amount of any A Advances other than as provided in this
subsection (a). The Company may, upon at least one Business
Day's notice to the Administrative Agent in the case of Base Rate
Advances and at least three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent in the case of Eurodollar Advances stating
the proposed date and the aggregate principal amount of the
prepayment, and if such notice is given the Company shall, prepay
the outstanding principal amounts of the A Advances comprising
part of the same A Borrowing in whole or ratably in part;
provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be
in an aggregate principal amount not less than $5,000,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) the
Company shall pay all accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the portion of any A Advance being prepaid and
shall, in the case of any such prepayment of any Eurodollar
Advance, be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.13. Base Rate Advances may be prepaid
without premium or penalty.

(b) (i) The Lenders may require prepayment of the
Advances and termination of the Commitments in the manner
set forth in subsection (b)(ii) below, upon the occurrence
(or, as set forth in subsection (b)(ii) below, the proposed
occurrence) of either of the following events (the events
described in clauses (x) or (y) are sometimes hereinafter
referred to as a "Change of Control"):

(x) any Person or two or more Persons acting
in concert shall have acquired beneficial ownership or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934),

20
<PAGE> 21
directly or indirectly, of securities of GFC Financial
or the Company (or other securities convertible into
such securities) representing 25% or more of the
combined voting power of all securities of GFC Financial or
the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors,
other than securities having such power only by reason of
the happening of a contingency ("Share Acquisition"); or

(y) individuals who either (1) have been
directors of GFC Financial or the Company for the prior
24-month period or (2) were nominated or elected by
directors in office during such period (but prior to
any Share Acquisition) shall cease for any reason to
constitute a majority of the board of directors of GFC
Financial or the Company.

(ii) The Company shall give prompt written notice
to each Lender ("Company Notice") of any proposed or actual
Change of Control as follows: (x) if the Company has
knowledge of and the board of directors consents to (or does
not oppose) a proposed Change of Control, the Company shall
notify the Lenders of such Change of Control not more than
60 days nor less than 30 days prior to the consummation of
the Change of Control and (y) with respect to a Change of
Control to which the Company's board of directors does not
consent and opposes, the Company shall notify the Lenders of
such Change of Control immediately after the Company
receives notice of such Change of Control. For a period of
90 days following receipt of the Company Notice by each
Lender, each Lender shall have the right by written notice
to the Company ("Lender Notice") to terminate its Commitment
and to require the Company to prepay in whole, but not in
part, without premium or penalty, all Advances of such
Lender, with accrued interest and fees to the date of such
prepayment on the amount of such Advances prepaid. The date
of prepayment and termination of any Commitments following
the Company's receipt of any Lender Notices shall be
determined by the Company and shall not be less than 60 or
more than 90 days after the date of receipt by the Company
of the first Lender Notice. The Company agrees to make such
prepayment if so required.

SECTION 2.05. Interest on A Advances.
_______________________

(a) The Company shall pay interest accrued on the
principal amount of each A Advance (i) in the case of Base Rate
Advances at the Base Rate and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar
Advances at the Eurodollar Rate until the final payment in full
thereof as herein provided. Interest in respect of Base Rate
Advances shall be payable on the last day of each Interest Period
and, in the case of each Interest Period of greater than 30 days
duration, on each day which occurs every 30 days from the first

21
<PAGE> 22
day of such Interest Period and interest in respect of Eurodollar
Advances shall be payable on the last day of each Interest Period
and, in the case of each Interest Period of greater than three
months duration, on each day which occurs during such Interest
Period every three months from the first day of such Interest
Period. Interest in respect of any A Advances, with respect to
any Lender, shall also be payable on the Termination Date for
such Lender and upon prepayment of any A Advance to the extent
accrued on the amount so prepaid. Overdue principal and, to the
extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each A
Advance and all other overdue amounts owing hereunder shall,
except in the case of a Eurodollar Advance or B Advance, bear
interest for each day such amount is overdue at a rate per annum
equal to 2% per annum in excess of the Base Rate in effect from
time to time and shall in the case of a Eurodollar Advance bear
interest for each day such amount is overdue at a rate per annum
equal to (A) during the Interest Period applicable to such
Eurodollar Advance, the greater of (x) 2% per annum above the
Base Rate in effect from time to time and (y) 2% per annum above
the rate per annum required to be paid on such amount immediately
prior to the date on which such amount became due and (B) after
the expiration of such Interest Period, 2% per annum above the
Base Rate in effect from time to time. In no event shall
interest payable hereunder to any Lender exceed the maximum rate
of interest payable to such Lender under applicable law.

(b) For each A Advance the Company shall select an
interest period (each such period being an "Interest Period") to
be applicable to such Advance. The Interest Period for each A
Advance shall begin on the last day of the immediately preceding
Interest Period, if any. The duration of each Interest Period
shall be (i) in the case of a Base Rate Advance, 30 or 60 days
(or such shorter period as shall extend to and end on the
Termination Date for any Lender) and (ii) in the case of a
Eurodollar Advance, one, two, three or six months, in each case
as the Company may select upon notice received by the
Administrative Agent (y) not later than 11:00 A.M. on the first
Business Day of such Interest Period, in the case of a Base Rate
Advance, or (z) at least three Business Days, in the case of a
Eurodollar Advance, prior to the first day of such Interest
Period; provided, however, that:

(i) if the Company fails to select the duration
of any Interest Period, on the day immediately following the
last day of the then current Interest Period for such A
Advance, the Company shall be deemed to have requested a
Base Rate Advance in the amount of such A Advance with an
Interest Period of 30 days;

(ii) Interest Periods commencing on the same date
for A Advances comprising part of the same A Borrowing shall
be of the same duration;

22
<PAGE> 23
(iii) the Company may not select any Interest
Period in respect of A Advances which ends after the
Termination Date then in effect for any Lender; and

(iv) whenever the last day of any Interest Period
would otherwise occur on a day other than a Business Day,
the last day of such Interest Period shall be extended to
occur on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, in the
case of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Advance, that
if such extension would cause the last day of such Interest
Period to occur in the next following calendar month, the
last day of such Interest Period shall occur on the next
preceding Business Day.

The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise each Lender by
telex or telecopy facsimile of each Interest Period selected by
the Company.

SECTION 2.06. Additional Interest on Eurodollar Advances. 
___________________________________________

The Company shall pay to each Lender, so long as
such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain reserves
with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including
Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurodollar Advance of such Lender,
from the date of such Eurodollar Advance until maturity of such
Eurodollar Advance, at an interest rate per annum equal at all
times during the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Advance to
the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the LIBO Rate for such
Interest Period from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such LIBO
Rate referred to in clause (i) above by that percentage equal to
100% minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage of such Lender for
such Interest Period, payable on each date on which interest is
payable on such Eurodollar Advance. Such additional interest
shall be determined by such Lender and notified to the Company
through the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination.
____________________________

(a) Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the
Administrative Agent timely information for the purpose of
determining each LIBO Rate. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.02(b)(ii), if any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not
furnish such timely information to the Administrative Agent for
determination of any such interest rate, the Administrative Agent
shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely
information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice
to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate
determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of this
Agreement and, if requested by any Lender, the applicable rate,

23
<PAGE> 24
if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for determining the
applicable interest rate.

(c) The Margin applicable to each interest rate shall
be determined by the Administrative Agent on the basis of timely
information furnished to it by the Company, D&P, Moody's or S&P
with respect to the rating on Long-term Debt; any change in the
Margin shall be effective on the earlier of the date on which
such rating change is publicly announced or on the date written
confirmation of a change in the rating on Long-term Debt or
Commercial Paper is sent to the Company by D&P, Moody's or S&P.

SECTION 2.08. Repayment of A Advances.
________________________

(a) Except as provided in Section 2.05(b)(i), the
Company shall repay the unpaid principal amount of each A Advance
made by each Lender on the last day of the Interest Period for
such A Advance, and the Company shall repay the unpaid principal
amount of all A Advances made by any Lender, together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other amount due
hereunder to such Lender, on the Termination Date as in effect
for such Lender.

(b) On the later of each date when any reduction
in the Lenders' Commitment is made by the Company pursuant to
Section 2.11(a) or the last day of the current Interest Periods
for the A Advances to be repaid, the Company shall repay the
A Advances in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the
aggregate principal amount of the A Advances outstanding on such
date over (y) the Total Commitments as reduced on such date
pursuant to Section 2.11(a) (computed after giving effect to
any B Reductions).

(c) On the date when any Lender's Commitment is
terminated pursuant to Section 2.11, the Company shall repay
the amount of all A Advances owing to such Lender.

SECTION 2.09. Increased Costs. 
________________

If, due to (i) the introduction of or any change (other than 
any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve 
requirements referred to in Section 2.06) in or in the 
interpretation of any law or regulation, (ii) the compliance 
with any guideline or request from any central bank or other 
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) 
or (iii) the imposition, modification or application of any 
capital adequacy or similar requirement (A) against assets 
(funded or contingent) of, or credit or commitments to extend 
credit extended by, any Lender or (B) otherwise applicable to 
the obligations of any Lender under this Agreement, there shall 
be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or 
making, funding or maintaining Advances (or, in the case of any 
capital adequacy or similar requirement, having the effect of 
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or increasing 
the amount of capital

24
<PAGE> 25
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender, taking into consideration
such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), which
such Lender is not otherwise compensated for by other provisions
of this Agreement, then the Company shall from time to time,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to indemnify
such Lender against such increased cost (or reduced rate of
return or increased amount of capital, to the extent such Lender
reasonably determines such reduction or increase to be allocable
to the maintenance of this Agreement). A certificate as to the
amount of such increased cost (providing an explanation thereof
and the calculation thereof, all in reasonable detail, and using
reasonable averaging and attribution methods), submitted to the
Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by such Lender
shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all
purposes.

SECTION 2.10. Facility Fee. 
_____________

The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the 
account of each Lender a facility fee on the daily amount of such 
Lender's Commitment (determined without regard to the amount of 
Advances outstanding thereunder and without giving effect to any 
B Reduction and after giving effect to any reduction thereof pursuant 
to Section 2.11) from the Effective Date (in the case of each Lender 
party hereto as of the Effective Date) or from the effective date 
specified in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance (in the case 
of any Lender becoming a Lender after the Effective Date), until the
Termination Date, as in effect for such Lender, payable in
arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and
December during the term of such Lender's Commitment, commencing
June 30, 1994, and on any such Termination Date, at the rate of:
with respect to each day that (i) Level 1 is applicable, 0.15%
per annum, (ii) Level 2 is applicable, 0.225% per annum,
(iii) Level 3 is applicable, 0.30% per annum, (iv) Level 4 is
applicable, 0.40% per annum, or (v) Level 5 is applicable, 0.50%
per annum. If any change in the rating by D&P, S&P or Moody's
shall result in a change in the Level, the change in the facility
fee shall be effective on the earlier of the date on which such
rating change is publicly announced or on the date written
confirmation of such rating is sent to the Company by D&P,
Moody's or S&P.

SECTION 2.11. Reduction of the Commitments.
_____________________________

(a) The Company may, upon at least five Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce
ratably in part the respective unused Commitments of the Lenders;
provided that each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate
amount of not less than $5,000,000 or, if greater, in an
aggregate amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000.

25
<PAGE> 26
(b) At any time, if no event has occurred and is
continuing which constitutes an Event of Default or which would
constitute an Event of Default but for the requirement that
notice be given or time elapse or both, the Company may, with the
consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), terminate the Commitment of any one of
the Lenders (each an "Old Lender") upon at least five Business
Days' notice to the Administrative Agent and the Old Lender, and,
effective upon the date of termination of the entire Commitment
of, and repayment of all amounts hereunder owing to, the Old
Lender, may replace that Lender with a New Lender pursuant to
the provisions of Section 8.02; provided however, that, as to
outstanding Eurodollar Advances and B Advances, a Commitment may
be terminated only at the end of an Interest Period or maturity
of such B Advances such that the Commitment of an Old Lender may
be terminated in stages, a portion terminating as specified by
the Company in its notice and the remainder, equal to the
outstanding Eurodollar Advances or B Advances, as applicable,
terminating at the end of the relevant Interest Period or
maturity of such B Advances; provided, further, that, the Company
may terminate the Commitment of a Lender under this Section
2.11(b) only if the Company shall also terminate such Lender's
Commitment under and as defined in the Short Term Facility Credit
Agreement.

SECTION 2.12. Payments and Computations.
__________________________

(a) The Company shall make each payment hereunder not
later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due
in United States dollars to the Administrative Agent in same day
funds at the Administrative Agent's address provided for in
Section 8.03. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter
make appropriate distribution of like funds to the Lenders for
the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices.

(b) The Company hereby authorizes each Lender, if and
to the extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due
hereunder, to charge from time to time against any or all of the
Company's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.

(c) All computations of interest in respect of
Eurodollar Advances and interest pursuant to Section 2.06 shall
be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, and all computations
of facility fees and of interest in respect of Base Rate Advances
shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the
case may be, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in
the period for which such interest or facility fees are payable.
Each determination by the Administrative Agent (or, in the case
of Section 2.06, by a Lender) of an interest rate hereunder
shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all
purposes.

26
<PAGE> 27
(d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to
be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of
time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment
of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided,
however, if such extension would cause a payment in respect of
Eurodollar Advances to be made in the next following calendar
month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business
Day.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Company will not
make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Company has made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to
each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then
due such Lender. If and to the extent the Company shall not have
so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each
Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the rate per annum equal
to the rate customarily used by member banks of the Federal
Reserve System to settle net balances due each other.

SECTION 2.13. Compensation. 
_____________

The Company shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by 
that Lender (which request shall be submitted to the Company 
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and shall set forth in 
reasonable detail the calculation of such amounts requested, which 
shall be based upon a method of determination selected in good faith) 
for all losses, reasonable expenses and liabilities (including,
without limitation, any interest paid by that Lender to lenders
of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Advances
or B Advances and any loss sustained by that Lender in connection
with re-employment of such funds), which that Lender may sustain:
(i) if for any reason (including without limitation the
circumstances set forth in Section 2.02(c) but other than a
default by that Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Advance or
B Advance does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice
of Borrowing, (ii) if any repayment of any of its Eurodollar
Advances or B Advances occurs on a date which is not the last day
of any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Advances and maturity
date for B Advances, or (iii) as a consequence of any other
default by the Company to repay its Eurodollar Advances when
required by the terms of this Agreement; it being agreed and
understood that each Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to
mitigate any such loss or expense.

27
<PAGE> 28
SECTION 2.14. Taxes.
______

(a) Any and all payments by the Company hereunder
shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.12, free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (1) in the case of
each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its
net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any
political subdivision thereof, (2) in the case of each Lender,
taxes imposed on its net income and franchise taxes imposed on it
by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or
any political subdivision thereof and (3) in the case of each
Lender and the Administrative Agent, any taxes imposed by the
United States by means of withholding at the source if and to the
extent that such taxes shall be in effect and shall be
applicable, on the date hereof, to payments to be made to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender's Applicable Lending Office
(all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings
and liabilities, other than those excluded pursuant to the
preceding clauses (1), (2) and (3), being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If the Company shall be required by law to deduct
any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any
Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and
(iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present
or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any
payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) The Company will indemnify each Lender and the
Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.14)
paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may
be) or any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such
Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes
written demand therefor. Each Lender agrees to provide
reason-

28

<PAGE> 29
ably prompt notice to the Administrative Agent and the
Company of any imposition of Taxes or Other Taxes against such
Lender; provided that failure to give such notice shall not
affect such Lender's right to indemnification hereunder. Each
Lender agrees it will promptly upon request by the Company
furnish to the Company such evidence as is reasonably available
to such Lender as to the payment of the relevant Taxes or Other
Taxes, and that it will, if requested by the Company, cooperate
to the extent reasonable under the circumstances with the Company
in its efforts to obtain a refund or similar release in respect
of such payment.

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of
Taxes, the Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent upon
request of any Lender transmitted through the Administrative
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.03, the original
or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. If
no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment hereunder, the
Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent upon request of
any Lender transmitted through the Administrative Agent, at such
address, a certificate from each appropriate taxing authority, or
an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in
either case stating that such payment is exempt from or not
subject to Taxes.

(e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date
of its execution and delivery of this Agreement (in the case of
each Lender party hereto on the Effective Date) and on the
effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other
Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing
by the Company (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully
able to do so), shall provide the Company with Internal Revenue
Service form 1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or any successor form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such
Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to
which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of
withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the
income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively
connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United
States.

(f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Company hereunder, the agreements and
obligations of the Company contained in this Section 2.14 shall
survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder.

SECTION 2.15. Sharing of Payments, Etc. 
_________________________

If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntarily, 
involuntarily, through the exercise of any right of set-off, 
or otherwise) on account of the A Advances made by it (other 
than pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09, 2.11(b), 2.13 or 2.14) in 
excess of its

29
<PAGE> 30
ratable share of payments on account of the A Advances of the
same type obtained by all the Lenders in the same category, such
Lender shall forthwith purchase from such other Lenders such
participations in the A Advances made by them as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them, provided, however, that on and
after the date that an Event of Default has occurred and the
Total Commitments have been terminated, the foregoing provisions
shall apply to payments on account of, and shall be shared on the
basis of, all Advances outstanding, provided, further, that if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered
from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and
the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest. The Company agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-
off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of
such participation.

SECTION 2.16. Status of Prior Agreement. 
__________________________

The Company, the Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that 
the rights of each (if any) under the Fifth Amendment and 
Restatement dated as of May 18, 1993 of the Credit Agreement 
dated as of May 31, 1976, as amended by the First Amendment dated 
as of January 31, 1994 and the Second Amendment dated as of 
March 8, 1994 (the "Prior Agreement"), shall (except, as to 
outstanding Advances, commitment fees and interest accrued to the 
Effective Date, and rights to indemnification and reimbursement of 
costs and expenses arising prior to the Effective Date which shall 
be governed by the provisions of the Prior Agreement) (i) continue to be
governed by the Prior Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Date and the termination of the Prior Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) cease and terminate as of
the Effective Date and the rights of each such party shall be
governed by this Agreement on and after such date.

SECTION 2.17. Extension of Commitments. 
_________________________

At any time at not more than twenty-seven (27) months nor less than ninety
(90) days prior to the Termination Date applicable to all or any
Lenders, the Company may, at its option, deliver to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver to each Lender
that has not theretofore rejected any Extension Request delivered
pursuant to this Section 2.17) a signed copy of an Extension
Request requesting an extension of such Termination Date to a
date one year after such Termination Date. Each Lender may, in its
sole discretion, consent or not consent to any such Extension
Request and, if such Lender so consents, such Lender shall
deliver its consent to such Extension Request to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Company of
such consent) within forty-five (45) days of the date of the
Extension Request. Any Lender that fails to consent to any
Extension

30
<PAGE> 31
Request within such forty-five-day period shall be
deemed to have rejected such Extension Request. If the
Administrative Agent shall not have received, within such forty-
five-day period, consents to such Extension Request from the
Majority Lenders (determined for purposes of this Section 2.17 by
disregarding any Lender which has theretofore rejected any
Extension Request), the Company may elect either (i) to withdraw
the Extension Request by promptly notifying the Administrative
Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders originally
receiving the Extension Request) by telephone, telex or telecopy
facsimile of such withdrawal or (ii) to proceed with such
Extension Request by immediately notifying the Administrative
Agent (which shall promptly notify each Lender which consented to
the Extension Request) by telephone, telex or telecopy facsimile,
of the fact that the Majority Lenders have not consented to the
Extension Request and that the Company nonetheless desires such
extension, and any such Lender may, within five (5) Business Days
of its receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent, by
telephone, telex or telecopy facsimile notice to the
Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Company),
withdraw its consent to such Extension Request. If the Company
withdraws any Extension Request, such Extension Request shall
thereafter be disregarded for all purposes, including the
determination of whether any Lender has rejected an Extension
Request. In the event any Lenders finally consent to any
Extension Request, the Termination Date to be extended pursuant
to such request shall be extended for one year from the then
current Termination Date but only as to such consenting Lenders.

No Interest Period shall extend beyond any Termination
Date, regardless of any Lender's consent to any extension
thereof. The Commitment of any Lender rejecting an Extension
Request with respect to a Termination Date shall expire on such
Termination Date, and the Company shall pay all Advances of such
Lender, and all other amounts due hereunder to such Lender, in
full on such Termination Date.

SECTION 2.18. Evidence of Debt.
_________________

(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness
of the Company to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing
to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from
time to time hereunder.

(b) The Register maintained by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 8.04(d) shall include a control
account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which
accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date, amount
and tenor, as applicable, of each Borrowing, the Type of Advances
comprising such Borrowing and the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance
deliv-

31
<PAGE> 32
ered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and
payable from the Company to each Lender hereunder, and (iv) the
amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent from the
Company hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.

(c) The entries made in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(d) Any Lender may at any time request that the
Borrower execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note (a
"Note"), substantially in the form of Exhibit F annexed hereto,
to evidence such Lender's Advances hereunder. The Borrower
agrees promptly upon its receipt of any such request from a
Lender to execute and deliver a Note to such Lender.

results of operations of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries for the periods ended on such dates, all in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis, and since
December 31, 1993, there has been no material adverse change in
such condition or operations which has not been disclosed in

of its important activities, in the business of extending credit
for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within
the meaning of Regulation U issued by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System), and no proceeds of any Advance will
be used to purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend credit

33
<PAGE> 34
to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin
stock, or in any manner which might cause such Advance or the
application of such proceeds to violate (or require any

such use of proceeds.

ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material liability to the PBGC
in connection with any employee benefit plan (or other class of
benefit plan which the PBGC has elected to insure) established or
maintained by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates. To the
knowledge of the Company, after due inquiry made at the time of
the spin off referred to below, The Dial Corp, an Arizona
corporation ("Dial"), was at the time of its distribution of 100%
of the Capital Stock of the Company and the Subsidiaries to the
shareholders of Dial (the "spin off"), in substantial compliance

in connection with any employee benefit plan (or other class of
benefit plan which the PBGC has elected to insure) established or
maintained by Dial or any of its ERISA Affiliates at such time.

occurring 45 days after the Effective Date and (ii) June 30,
1994, except for indebtedness incurred in connection with the
acquisition of TriCon), the obligations of the Company under this
Agreement to pay the principal of and interest on the Advances
and any and all other amounts due hereunder rank and will rank,
as to payment and security, at least pari passu with the highest
ranking indebtedness of the Company for borrowed money or under
guarantees or in respect of any indenture, contract, agreement or
other instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it
is bound evidencing or securing any obligation of the Company for
borrowed money whether now existing or incurred hereafter.

(l) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
liabilities or incurs any costs with respect to compliance with
Environmental Laws (including, without limitation, any capital or
operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of
properties presently or previously owned, any capital or
operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance
with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a
condi-

34
<PAGE> 35
tion to any license, permit or contract, any related
constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or
permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of
or change in the nature of operations conducted thereat and any
actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including
employees, and any related costs and expenses) which will have,
and the Company otherwise believes that Environmental Laws are
unlikely to have, a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the

more than $1,000,000 (or, in the case of a Termination Event
involving a "substantial employer" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(2) of ERISA), the withdrawing employer's
proportionate share of such excess shall exceed such
amount);

then, and in any such event (other than an event described in
subsection (g) hereof), the Administrative Agent shall at the
request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by
notice to the Company, without prejudice to the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against
the Company, (i) declare the obligation of each Lender to make
Advances to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith
terminate, and (ii) cause all of the Advances, all interest
thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement to be
forthwith due and payable, whereupon all Advances, all such

47
<PAGE> 48
interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due
and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
the Company. If an Event of Default described in subsection (g)
hereof occurs, any obligation on the part of the Lenders
hereunder shall automatically terminate and all sums of
principal, interest and fees remaining on the Advances shall be
immediately due and payable without notice, presentment, demand
or notices of any kind, all of which are expressly waived.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND AGENTS

SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. 
_________________________

Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent and
Agents to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent and Agents by the terms hereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to
any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent and Agents shall not be required to exercise
any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act
or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so
acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
Lenders having at least 51% of the Total Commitments and such
instruction shall be binding upon all Lenders; provided, however,
that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Agent shall be
required to take any action which exposes the Administrative
Agent or such Agent, as the case may be, to personal liability
or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law.

SECTION 7.02. Agents' Reliance, Etc. 
______________________

None of the Administrative Agent, any Agent or any of their respective
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in
connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Administrative Agent
and Agents: (i) may treat the Lender making any Advance as the
holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and
accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such Lender,
as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, in accordance with Section
8.04; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for
the Company), independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes no
warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with this Agreement;

performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions

48
<PAGE> 49
of this Agreement on the part of the Company or to inspect the property 
(including the books and records) of the Company, except as expressly set 
forth herein; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due 
execution (other than its own due execution), legality, validity, 
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or 
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall
incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by
acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument
or writing (which may be by telegram, telex or telecopy
facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent
by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.03. Citibank, BofA , Chemical, BofM, NatWest
________________________________________

and Their Affiliates. 
_____________________

With respect to its Commitment and the Advances made by it, Citibank, 
BofA, BofM, Chemical, NatWest or any Agent, as the case may be, shall 
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender 
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or an
Agent, as the case may be; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"
shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include each of
Citibank, BofA, BofM, Chemical, NatWest and any Agent in its
individual capacity. Citibank, BofA, BofM, Chemical, NatWest and
each Agent and their respective affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and
generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company, any
of the Subsidiaries and any person or entity who may do business
with or own securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, all as
if Citibank, BofA, BofM, Chemical, NatWest or such Agent were not
the Administrative Agent or an Agent, as the case may be, and
without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. 
_______________________

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance 
upon the Administrative Agent, any Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements referred to in Section 3.01 and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent,
any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. 
________________

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Agent 
(to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the 
respective amounts of the A Advances then held by each of them (or if no 
A Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective 
amounts of their Commitments, or, if an Event of Default shall have occurred 
and the Total Commitments shall have been terminated, ratably according to 
the respective amounts of

49
<PAGE> 50
the Advances then held by each of them), from and against any and all 
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent or
such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or such Agent under this
Agreement, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative
Agent's or such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative
Agent and each Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, administration, or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent or such Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the
Company.

SECTION 7.06. Successor Agent. 
________________

The Administrative Agent and any Agent may resign at any time by giving 
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Company and the
Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without
cause by Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal
of the Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders shall have the
right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by
Majority Lenders, and if no successor Administrative Agent shall
have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
removal of the retiring Administrative Agent by Majority Lenders,
then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be
a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States
of America or of any State thereof and having combined capital
and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or a Lender. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder
by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Except as otherwise
specifically designated herein, none of the Lenders identified on
the signature pages of this Agreement as an Agent shall have any
right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under
this Agreement other than

50
<PAGE> 51
those applicable to all Lenders as such. Each Lender acknowledges that
it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders so identified
as an Agent in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not
taking action hereunder.

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 8.01. No Waiver; Amendments. 
______________________

No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender 
or the Company in exercising any power or right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right or power preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power
hereunder. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by any party
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall
be in writing and consented to by the Majority Lenders and the
Company (except that no such amendment, modification, waiver or
consent which would increase any Lender's Commitment, reduce, or
postpone any date fixed for any payment of, principal of, or
interest on, the A Advances or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder or change the percentage of the Commitments or of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the A Advances which shall
be required for the Lenders or any of them to take action
hereunder (including, without limitation, any amendment to the
definition of "Majority Lenders" or this Section 8.01) or which
would affect any provision contained in Section 5.01, Section
5.02 (if and to the extent that the Borrowing which is the
subject of such amendment, waiver or consent would involve an
increase in the aggregate amount of Advances over the aggregate
amount of Advances outstanding immediately prior to such
Borrowing), Section 5.03, this Section 8.01 or Section 8.05 shall
be effective unless consented to by all Lenders then having a
Commitment) and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given; provided, however, that the amount of any Lender's
Commitment may be raised by agreement in writing between the
Company and such Lender, with notice thereof to each other Lender
then having a Commitment and to the Administrative Agent;
provided further, that any amendment, modification, termination
or waiver of the principal amount of any B Advance or payments or
prepayments by the Company in respect thereof, the scheduled
maturity dates of any B Advance, the dates on which interest is
payable and decreases in interest rates borne by B Advances shall
not be effective without the written concurrence of the Lender
which has funded such B Advance. No amendment, modification or
waiver of or consent with respect to any provision contained in
Article VII shall be effective unless consented to by the
Administrative Agent. No notice to or demand on any party in any
case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances.

51
<PAGE> 52
SECTION 8.02. New Lenders. 
____________

At any time when any Lender shall have a Commitment, if no event 
has occurred and is continuing which constitutes an Event of 
Default or which would constitute an Event of Default but for the 
requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both, the Company 
may notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that it desires to add
one or more additional lenders to the Lenders hereunder;
provided, however, that no such new lender will have a Commitment
larger than the largest Commitment of a Lender. Such notice
shall identify each such lender, the amount of its proposed
Commitment and the proposed effective date of its inclusion
hereunder (which shall be the last day of all then current
Interest Periods if there are Base Rate Advances or Eurodollar
Advances then outstanding from the Lenders). Upon such proposed
date, such lender shall become a Lender hereunder for all
purposes and to the same effect as if set forth on the signature
pages hereof, subject to its execution where indicated below and
delivery to the Administrative Agent of at least one counterpart
of this Agreement (which shall be deemed to include all
amendments thereto) and the execution and delivery by the
Administrative Agent and the Company of each such counterpart.

SECTION 8.03. Notices, Etc. 
_____________

All communications and notices provided for hereunder, unless 
otherwise specified in this Agreement, shall be in writing 
(including telecopier, telegraphic, telex or cable communication) 
and, if to the Company, mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed, cabled or
delivered to it, addressed to it at Dial Tower, Phoenix, Arizona
85077-1215 (Telecopier Number: (602) 207-5543), Attention of
Treasurer's Department, and if to any Lender, mailed, telecopied,
telegraphed, telexed, cabled or delivered to it, addressed to it
at its Domestic Lending Office as set forth on the signature
pages hereof, and, if to the Administrative Agent, mailed,
telecopied, telegraphed, telexed, cabled or delivered to it,
addressed to it c/o Citicorp USA, Inc., 1 Sansome Street, San
Francisco, California 94104 (Telecopier Number: (415) 433-0307),
Attention: Cindy Lee; or, as to each party, at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice
to each other party. All such notices and communications shall,
when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed or cabled, be
effective 5 days after deposited in the mails, when telecopied,
when delivered to the telegraph company, when confirmed by telex
answerback or when delivered to the cable company, respectively,
except that notices and communications to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Article II or VII shall not be effective until
received by the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.04. Assignments, Participations etc.
________________________________

(a) Any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative
Agent and the Company, assign to any other current Lender, or,
with notice to the Administrative Agent and with the prior
written consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, each

52
<PAGE> 53
of which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld (it being
understood and agreed that it shall not be considered
unreasonable to fail to consent to the assignment of all or any
part of the A Advances or the Commitments or any other rights or
obligations of such Lender hereunder if such Lender's interests
under the Short Term Facility Credit Agreement are not
proportionately assigned), assign to any Eligible Assignee (each
an "Assignee") all or any part of the A Advances or the
Commitments or any other rights or obligations of such Lender
hereunder in a minimum amount of $5,000,000; provided, however,
that the amount of the A Advances and the Commitment of the
assignor Lender being assigned may be in an amount equal to such
assignor Lender's entire Commitment and such Lender's entire
outstanding A Advances provided, further, that the Company and
the Administrative Agent may continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with the interests so assigned to
an Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment, together
with payment instructions, addresses and related information with
respectto the Assignee, shall have been given to the Company and the
Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Assignee and
(ii) such Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered to the
Company and the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance
in the form of Exhibit C ("Assignment and Acceptance"); and
(iii) the processing fees of $2,500 shall have been paid to the
Administrative Agent (which fees shall also cover concurrent
assignments of such Lender's interests under the Short Term
Facility Credit Agreement). Any assignment hereunder shall be
of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and
obligations of the assignor under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any of the preceding limitations on any Lender's
ability to assign any part of the Advances or the Commitments to
any other Person, each Lender may assign its rights (including,
without limitation, rights to payment) under this Agreement to
any Federal Reserve Bank without notice to or consent of, and
without payment of any processing fee to, the Company or the
Administrative Agent. To facilitate any such pledge to a Federal
Reserve Bank, the Company will, as provided in Section 2.18(d),
execute and deliver to such Lender a Note to evidence such
Advances.

(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the Assignee
thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other
parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, such assignor Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made
in or in connection with any of this Agreement or the execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assignor Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to the financial condition of the Company or the

53
<PAGE> 54
performance or observance by the Company of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such Assignee confirms that it
has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of
the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee will, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Agent
or such assignor Lender or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement; (v) such Assignee confirms
that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such Assignee appoints and
authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Agents to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under
this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent and
the Agents by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such Assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required
to be performed by it as a Lender.

(c) From and after the date that the Administrative
Agent notifies the assignor Lender that it has received the
Assignment and Acceptance (which notice shall be promptly given
by the Administrative Agent), (i) the Assignee thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned
by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its
rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all
or the remaining portion of the assignor Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto).

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its
address referred to in Section 8.03 a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to,
each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice. Immediately upon each
assignee's making its payment under the Assignment and
Accep-

54
<PAGE> 55
tance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the
extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition
of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments
arising therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee
shall reduce such Commitments of the assignor Lender pro tanto.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
paragraph (a) of this Section 8.04, each Lender may assign to one
or more Eligible Assignees or insurance companies any B Advance
or B Advances made by it.

(f) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more
Eligible Assignees or insurance companies (a "Participant")
participating interests in any Advances, the Commitment of that
Lender or any other interest of that Lender hereunder; provided,
however, that (i) the Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Lender shall remain solely
responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the
Company and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with the Lender in connection with the
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (iv) no
Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest under
which the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment
to, or any consent or waiver with respect to this Agreement
except to the extent such amendment, consent or waiver would:
(A) extend the Termination Date; or (B) reduce the interest rate
or the amount of principal or fees applicable to Advances or the
Commitments in which such participant is participating. In the
case of any such participation, the Participant shall not have
any rights under this Agreement and all amounts payable by the
Company hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not
sold such participation, except that if amounts outstanding under
this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or
shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of
set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender
under this Agreement.

(g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant
to this Section 8.04, disclose to the Assignee or participant or
proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the
Company and any Subsidiary furnished to such Lender by or on
behalf of the Company; provided that, prior to any such
disclosure, the Assignee or Participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any
confidential information relating to the Company or any
Subsidiary received by it from such Lender.

O'Melveny & Myers and the allocated costs of internal counsel)
and out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent,

(b) Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consummated, the Company agrees to indemnify,
pay and hold the Administrative Agent, each Agent, each Lender,
and the officers, directors, employees and agents of the
Administrative Agent, the Agents and the Lenders, harmless from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
costs and expenses (whether or not any of the foregoing Persons
is a party to any litigation), including without limitation
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and costs of investigation,
with respect to any acquisition or proposed acquisition or
any other use or proposed use of proceeds of the Advances
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), provided that
the Company shall have no obligation hereunder with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities arising from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any such Persons. If any claim is made,
or any action, suit or proceeding is brought against any Person
indemnified pursuant to this Section 8.05(b), the indemnified
Person shall notify the Company of such claim or of the
commencement of such action, suit or proceeding, and the Company
will assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding,
employing counsel selected by the Company and reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified Person, and pay the fees and
expenses of such counsel; provided, however, that if counsel to
the Administrative Agent or the Person seeking indemnification
hereunder shall reasonably determine that, due to conflicts in
the liabilities or defenses of the Company and the Administrative
Agent, the Agents and the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the
Agents or the Lenders should retain their own counsel, the
Administrative Agent, the Agents and the Lenders shall have the
right to retain their own counsel and the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of the Company.

time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of the Company against any and all of the

with the same effect as if each Lender had joined therein.

SECTION 8.09. Several Obligations. 
____________________

Subject to Section 8.10 hereof, the obligation of each Lender hereunder 
is several, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be
responsible for the obligation or Commitment of any other Lender

performance of their respective obligations hereunder. Nothing
contained in this Agreement and no action taken by the Lenders
pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders a
partnership, association, joint venture or other entity.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

As Vice President-General Counsel and Secretary of Greyhound 
Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), I am
familiar with the Sixth Amendment and Restatement dated as of May 16, 1994 of
Credit Agreement dated May 31, 1976, among the Company, the Lenders named
therein, the Agents named therein, Bank of America National Trust and Savings

letter is being delivered to you in satisfaction of the condition set forth in
Section 5.01(b) of the Credit Agreement and with the understanding that you are
entering into the Credit Agreement in reliance on the opinions expressed
herein.

In this connection, I have examined such certificates of public 
officials, certificates of officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries
and copies certified to my satisfaction of corporate documents and records of
the Company and the Subsidiaries and of other papers, and have made such other
investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for my
opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied upon such certificates of public
officials and of officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to
the accuracy of material factual matters contained therein which were not
independently established.

6. No governmental consents, approvals, registrations,
declarations or filings are required to be obtained or made by the Company in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

7. To the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits

as a whole, or (b) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under
the Credit Agreement, except as disclosed on Schedule II hereto.

I am admitted to the bar in the State of Arizona, and I express
no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction except the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United
States of America. While the Credit Agreement is stated to be governed by the
laws of the State of New York, I have, with your permission, expressed the
opinions herein as if the Credit Agreement were governed by the laws of the
State of Arizona. With respect to such laws, my opinions are what the law is
at the date hereof, and I assume no obligation to supplement this opinion due
to any change in the law, legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise.

To the extent that the obligations of the Company may be
dependent upon such matters, I have assumed for the purposes of this opinion
that each Person who is a party to the Credit Agreement (other than the
Company) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; that the Credit Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by each such Person (other than the
Company) and constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of each such
Person (other than the Company), enforceable in accordance with its terms; the
genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of each natural person
executing the Credit Agreement (other than any such person executing the Credit
Agreement on behalf of the Company); the authenticity and completeness of
documents submitted as originals, and the conformity of documents submitted as
copies; that the Credit Agreement accurately describes and contains the
agreement and mutual understandings of the parties, and that there are no
verbal or written statements or agreements that modify, amend or vary, or
purport to modify, amend or vary, any of the terms of the Credit Agreement;
that you will receive no interest, charges, fees or other benefits or
compensation in the nature of interest in connection with the Credit Agreement
or its related transactions other than those that the Company has agreed in
writing to pay; that all parties to the Credit Agreement will enforce their
respective rights thereunder in circumstances and in a manner which are
commercially reasonable and in accordance with applicable law; and that

D-A-3-3

<PAGE> 93

each Person who is a party to the Credit Agreement (other than the
Company) has the requisite corporate or other organizational power and
authority to perform is obligations under the Credit Agreement.

This opinion is being delivered upon the express instructions of
the Company to Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., Bank of
America National Trust and Savings Association, Bank of Montreal, National
Westminster Bank USA and Chemical Bank, as Agents and the Lenders under the
Credit Agreement and is solely for their benefit in connection with the
transactions contemplated thereby. This opinion may not be relied upon by,
filed with, disclosed to, quoted in any manner to, referenced in any written
report, financial statement or other document to, or delivered to any other
person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without my prior written consent,
except that the Administrative Agent, each Agent and each Lender may use this
opinion (i) in connection with a review of the Credit agreement and
transactions related thereto by a regulatory agency having supervisory
authority over any such Person for the purpose of confirming the existence of
this opinion, (ii) in connection with the assertion of a defense as to which
this opinion is relevant and necessary, (iii) in response to a court order or

SECTION 2.01. The Advances.
_____________

(a) Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions 
hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to the Company from time to
time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date to but
excluding the Termination Date, as in effect for such Lender, in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the amount set
opposite such Lender's name on the signature pages hereof, as such amount may
be reduced pursuant to Section 2.10 (such Lender's "Commitment"). The
aggregate of all Commitments hereunder on the Effective Date is $950,000,000.
Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, the Company may from time to
time borrow, repay pursuant to Section 2.07 or prepay pursuant to Section 2.03,
and reborrow under this Section 2.01.

(b) Each Borrowing shall be (i) in the case of Base Rate Advances, 
in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $5,000,000 or, if
greater, in an aggregate principal amount which is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000, and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Advances, in an aggregate

Commitments.

12
<PAGE> 13
SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances.
____________________

(a) Each Borrowing shall be made on notice given not later than 
(i) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) in the case of a Borrowing which is to
consist of Base Rate Advances, on the Business Day of such Borrowing, and (ii)
12:00 Noon (New York City time) in the case of a Borrowing which is to consist
of Eurodollar Advances, on the third Business Day prior to such Borrowing, from
the Company to the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof
to each Lender). Each such notice (a "Notice of Borrowing") shall be by telex
or telecopy facsimile, confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the
form of Exhibit A hereto and shall specify (i) the date of such Borrowing,
which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the Type of Advances comprising such
Borrowing, (iii) the aggregate amount of the proposed Borrowing, and (iv) the
Interest Period for the Advances to be made as part of such Borrowing. Each
Lender through its Applicable Lending Office shall, before (x) in the case of a
Borrowing which is to consist of Base Rate Advances, 1:00 P.M. (New York City
time), and (y) in the case of a Borrowing which is to consist of Eurodollar
Advances, 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, make
available to the Administrative Agent at its address provided for in Section
8.03 such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing in same day funds. Upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V and after
receipt by the Administrative Agent of such funds, the Administrative Agent
will make such funds available to the Company at the Administrative Agent's
aforesaid address.

(b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding,

(i) if any Lender shall notify (which notice shall, if
given in relation to a proposed Borrowing, be given at least one
Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing) the
Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that
any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is
unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform
its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Advances or to fund or
maintain Eurodollar Advances hereunder, the Commitment of such Lender
to make Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company that such Lender has
determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist and such Lender's then outstanding Eurodollar Advances, if any,
shall be converted to Base Rate Advances; to the extent that such
affected Eurodollar Advances become Base Rate Advances, all payments of
principal that would have been otherwise applied to such Eurodollar
Advances shall be applied instead to such Lender's Base Rate Advances;
provided that if

13
<PAGE> 14

Majority Lenders are subject to the same illegality or
assertion of illegality, then the right of the Company to select
Eurodollar Advances for such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing
shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall
notify the Company that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be
converted to a Base Rate Advance;

(ii) if fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely
information to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.06 for
determining the LIBO Rate for Eurodollar Advances comprising any
requested Borrowing, the right of the Company to select Eurodollar
Advances for such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and
the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be converted to
a Base Rate Advance; and

(iii) if the Majority Lenders shall, at least one Business
Day before the date of any requested Borrowing, notify the
Administrative Agent that the LIBO Rate for Eurodollar Advances
comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such
Majority Lenders of making or funding their respective Eurodollar
Advances for such Borrowing, the right of the Company to select
Eurodollar Advances for such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing
shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension
no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be
converted to a Base Rate Advance.

(c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Company and, in respect of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar
Advances specified in any such notice, the Company shall, in accordance with
Section 2.12, indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense incurred by
such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date
specified for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article V,
including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits)
or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by any Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such
Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by a Lender before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the Business Day
of the making of a Base Rate Advance and 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) one
Business Day prior to the date of the making of any Eurodollar Advance that
such Lender does not

14

<PAGE> 15
intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's
portion of the Advances to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative
Agent on the date for the making of such Advances and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a
corresponding amount. If such portion is not in fact made available to the
Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent shall have
made such portion available to the Company as aforesaid, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover such portion on demand from such Lender,
which demand shall be made in a reasonably prompt manner. If such Lender does
not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Company
shall repay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the
Company, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect
of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the
Administrative Agent to the Company to the date such corresponding amount is
recovered by the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Company, the
interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and
(ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein shall
be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment
hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Company may have against any
Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be
made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such
Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any
Borrowing.

SECTION 2.03. Prepayments of Advances.
________________________

(a) The Company shall have no right to prepay any
principal amount of any Advances other than as provided in this subsection (a).
The Company may, upon at least one Business Day's notice to the Administrative
Agent in the case of Base Rate Advances and at least three Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent in the case of Eurodollar Advances stating
the proposed date and the aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if
such notice is given the Company shall, prepay the outstanding principal
amounts of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or
ratably in part; provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be
in an aggregate principal amount not less than $5,000,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) the Company 

15
<PAGE> 16
shall pay all accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
portion of any Advance being prepaid and shall, in the case of any such
prepayment of any Eurodollar Advance, be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.12. Base Rate Advances may be prepaid
without premium or penalty. Amounts prepaid in respect of the Term Loan may not
be reborrowed.

(b)(i) The Lenders may require prepayment of the Advances and
termination of the Commitments in the manner set forth in subsection
(b)(ii) below, upon the occurrence (or, as set forth in subsection
(b)(ii) below, the proposed occurrence) of either of the following
events (the events described in clauses (x) or (y) are sometimes
hereinafter referred to as a "Change of Control"):

(x) any Person or two or more Persons acting in

securities of GFC Financial or the Company (or other securities
convertible into such securities) representing 25% or more of
the combined voting power of all securities of GFC Financial or
the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors,
other than securities having such power only by reason of the
happening of a contingency ("Share Acquisition"); or

(y) individuals who either (1) have been directors
of GFC Financial or the Company for the prior 24- month period
or (2) were nominated or elected by directors in office during
such period (but prior to any Share Acquisition) shall cease
for any reason to constitute a majority of the board of
directors of GFC Financial or the Company.

(ii) The Company shall give prompt written notice to each Lender
("Company Notice") of any proposed or actual Change of Control as follows: (x)
if the Company has knowledge of and the board of directors consents to (or does

of such Change of Control not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days prior to
the consummation of the Change of Control and (y) with respect to a Change of
Control to which the Company's board of directors does not consent and opposes,

90 days following receipt of the Company Notice by each Lender, each Lender
shall have the right by written notice to the Company ("Lender Notice") to
terminate its Commitment

16

<PAGE> 17

and to require the Company to prepay in whole, but not in part, without
premium or penalty, all Advances of such Lender, with accrued interest
and fees to the date of such prepayment on the amount of such Advances
prepaid. The date of prepayment and termination of any Commitments
following the Company's receipt of any Lender Notices shall be

of a Eurodollar Advance, bear interest for each day such amount is overdue at a
rate per annum equal to 2% per annum in excess of the Base Rate in effect from

shorter period as shall extend to and end on the Termination Date for any
Lender) and (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Advance, one, two, three or six
months, in each case as the Company may select upon notice received by the

Interest Period, on the day immediately following the last day of the
then current Interest Period for such Advance the Company shall be
deemed to have requested a Base Rate Advance in the amount of such
Advance with an Interest Period of 30 days;

(ii) Interest Periods commencing on the same date for
Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing shall be of the same
duration;

(iii) the Company may not select any Interest Period in
respect of Advances which ends after the Termination Date then in
effect for any Lender (or after the Term Loan Maturity Date if such
Advances will be used to make the Term Loan); and

(iv) whenever the last day of any Interest Period would
otherwise occur on a day other than a Business Day, the last day of
such Interest Period shall be extended to occur on the next succeeding
Business Day; provided, in the case of any Interest Period for a
Eurodollar Advance, that if such extension would cause the last day of
such Interest Period to occur in the next following calendar month, the
last day of such Interest Period shall occur on the next preceding
Business Day.

The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise each Lender by telex or telecopy
facsimile of each Interest Period selected by the Company.

maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal
amount of each Eurodollar Advance of such Lender, from the date of such
Eurodollar Advance until maturity of such Eurodollar Advance, at an interest
rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Advance to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the LIBO Rate
for such 

18

<PAGE> 19
Interest Period from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such LIBO Rate
referred to in clause (i) above by that percentage equal to 100% minus the
Eurodollar Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable
on each date on which interest is payable on such Eurodollar Advance. Such
additional interest shall be determined by such Lender and notified to the
Company through the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.06. Interest Rate Determination.
____________________________

(a) Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the
Administrative Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each
LIBO Rate. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.02(b)(ii), if any one or
more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the
Administrative Agent for determination of any such interest rate, the
Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely
information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to
the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the

SECTION 2.08. Increased Costs. 
________________

If, due to (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change 
by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements referred to in 
Section 2.05) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation, 
(ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or 
other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) or 
(iii) the imposition, modification or application of any capital adequacy 
or similar requirement (A) against assets (funded or contingent) of, or 
credit or commitments to extend credit extended by, any Lender or (B) otherwise 
applicable to the obligations of any Lender under this Agreement, there shall 
be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, 
funding or maintaining Advances (or, in the case of any capital adequacy or 
similar requirement, having the effect of reducing the rate of return on 
such Lender's capital or increasing the amount of capital required or 
expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender, taking into consideration such Lender's policies with
respect to capital adequacy), which such Lender is not otherwise compensated
for by other provisions of this Agreement, then the Company shall from time to
time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for account of such
Lender additional amounts sufficient to indemnify such Lender against such
increased cost (or reduced rate of return or increased amount of capital, to
the extent such Lender reasonably determines such reduction or increase to be
allocable to the maintenance of this Agreement). A certificate as to the
amount of such increased cost (providing an explanation thereof and the
calculation thereof, all in reasonable detail, and using reasonable averaging
and attribution methods), submitted to the Company (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be
conclusive and binding for all purposes.

_____________

The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of 
each Lender a facility fee on the daily amount of such Lender's Commitment

(and, if the Term Loan shall have been made, such Lender's portion of the 
Term Loan) from the Effective Date (in the case of each Lender party hereto 
as of the Effective Date) or from the effective date specified in the 
applicable 

20

<PAGE> 21

Assignment and Acceptance (in the case of any Lender becoming a Lender
after the Effective Date), until the Termination Date, as in effect for such
Lender (or the Term Loan Maturity Date, if the Term Loan shall have been
made), payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and
December during the term of such Lender's Commitment (and the term of such
Lender's participation in the Term Loan if the Term Loan shall have been
made), commencing June 30, 1994, and on any suchTermination Date (and the Term
Loan Maturity Date), at the rate of: with respect to each day that (i) Level 1
is applicable, 0.125% per annum, (ii) Level 2 is applicable, 0.175% per annum,
(iii) Level 3 is applicable, 0.225% per annum, (iv) Level 4 is applicable,
0.30% per annum, or (v) Level 5 is applicable, 0.40% per annum. If any change
in the rating by D&P, S&P or Moody's shall result in a change in the Level, the
change in the facility fee shall be effective on the earlier of the date on
which such rating change is publicly announced or on the date written
confirmation of such rating is sent to the Company by D&P, Moody's or S&P.

SECTION 2.10. Reduction of the Commitments. 
_____________________________

(a) The Company may, upon at least five Business Days' notice
to the Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the
respective unused Commitments of the Lenders; provided that each partial
reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 or, if
greater, in an aggregate amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000.

(b) At any time, if no event has occurred and is
continuing which constitutes an Event of Default or which would constitute an
Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse or
both, the Company may, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), terminate the Commitment of any
one of the Lenders (each an "Old Lender") upon at least five Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent and the Old Lender, and, effective upon the
date of termination of the entire Commitment of, and repayment of all amounts
hereunder owing to, the Old Lender, may replace that Lender with a New Lender
pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.02; provided however, that, as to
outstanding Eurodollar Advances, a Commitment may be terminated only at the end
of an Interest Period such that the Commitment of an Old Lender may be
terminated in stages, a portion terminating as specified by the Company in its
notice and the remainder, equal to the outstanding Eurodollar Advances,
terminating at the end of the relevant Interest Period or Interest Periods;
provided, further, that, the Company may terminate the Commitment of a Lender
under this Section 2.10(b) only if the Company shall also terminate such
Lender's Commitment under and as defined in the Long Term Facility Credit

SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations.
__________________________

(a) The Company shall make each payment hereunder not
later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in United States
dollars to the Administrative Agent in same day funds at the Administrative
Agent's address provided for in Section 8.03. The Administrative Agent will
promptly thereafter make appropriate distribution of like funds to the Lenders
for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices.

(b) The Company hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to
the extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder, to
charge from time to time against any or all of the Company's accounts with such
Lender any amount so due.

(c) All computations of interest in respect of Eurodollar
Advances and interest pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be made on the basis of a
year of 360 days, and all computations of facility fees and of interest in
respect of Base Rate Advances shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period
for which such interest or facility fees are payable. Each determination by
the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.05, by a Lender) of an
interest rate hereunder shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding
for all purposes.

(d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be
due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case
may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause a payment in respect
of Eurodollar Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such
payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Lenders hereunder that the Company will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such
due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent the Company shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, at the rate per annum equal

23

<PAGE> 23
to the rate customarily used by member banks of the Federal Reserve System to 
settle net balances due each other.

SECTION 2.12. Compensation.
_____________

The Company shall compensate each Lender, upon written request
by that Lender (which request shall be submitted to the Company (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) and shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of such amounts requested, which shall be based upon a method of
determination selected in good faith) for all losses, reasonable expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any interest paid by that Lender to
lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Advances and
any loss sustained by that Lender in connection with re-employment of such
funds), which that Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (including
without limitation the circumstances set forth in Section 2.02(c) but other
than a default by that Lender) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Advance does not
occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing, (ii) if any
repayment of any of its Eurodollar Advances occurs on a date which is not the
last day of any Interest Period, or (iii) as a consequence of any other default
by the Company to repay its Eurodollar Advances when required by the terms of
this Agreement; it being agreed and understood that each Lender shall use its
reasonable efforts to mitigate any such loss or expense.

SECTION 2.13. Taxes.
______

(a) Any and all payments by the Company hereunder shall be
made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and without deduction
for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges
or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (1) in the
case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its net
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws
of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is
organized or any political subdivision thereof, (2) in the case of each Lender,
taxes imposed on its net income and franchise taxes imposed on it by the
jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof and (3) in the case of each Lender and the Administrative
Agent, any taxes imposed by the United States by means of withholding at the
source if and to the extent that such taxes shall be in effect and shall be
applicable, on the date hereof, to payments to be made to the Administrative
Agent or such Lender's Applicable Lending Office (all taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities, other than those excluded
pursuant to the preceding clauses (1), (2) and (3), being hereinafter referred
to as "Taxes"). If the Company shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the
Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be

23
<PAGE> 24
increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this 
Section 2.13) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) 
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such 
deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and (iii) 
the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority 
or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes,
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from
the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) The Company will indemnify each Lender and the
Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,
without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 2.13) paid by such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) or any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
Each Lender agrees to provide reasonably prompt notice to the Administrative
Agent and the Company of any imposition of Taxes or Other Taxes against such
Lender; provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect such
Lender's right to indemnification hereunder. Each Lender agrees it will
promptly upon request by the Company furnish to the Company such evidence as is
reasonably available to such Lender as to the payment of the relevant Taxes or
Other Taxes, and that it will, if requested by the Company, cooperate to the
extent reasonable under the circumstances with the Company in its efforts to
obtain a refund or similar release in respect of such payment.

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
the Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent upon request of any Lender
transmitted through the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in
Section 8.03, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof. If no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment hereunder, the
Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent upon request of any Lender
transmitted through the Administrative Agent, at such address, a certificate
from each appropriate taxing authority, or an opinion of counsel acceptable to
the Administrative Agent, in either case stating that such payment is exempt
from or not subject to Taxes.

24
<PAGE> 25
(e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement (in the case of each Lender party hereto on the
Effective Date) and on the effective date specified in the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other
Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company
(but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide
the Company with Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or
any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that
such Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the
United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments
of interest or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement
is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United
States.

(f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Company hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Company contained in this Section 2.13 shall survive the payment in full of
principal and interest hereunder.

SECTION 2.14. Sharing of Payments, Etc. 
_________________________

If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, 
through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the 
Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.05, 2.08, 2.10(b), 2.12 
or 2.13) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances 
of the same type obtained by all the Lenders in the same category, such Lender 
shall forthwith purchase from such other Lenders such participations in the 
Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender 
to share the excess payment ratably with each of them, provided, however, 
that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from 
such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price 
restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Company 
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender 
pursuant to this Section 2.14 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, 
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with 
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct 
creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.15. Extension of Termination Date. 
______________________________

(a) The Company may, no earlier than 50 days and not later than 30 days 
prior to the then effective Termination Date (as it may be extended from time 
to time pursuant hereto), and in any event not earlier than the Company's 
delivery to the Lenders of the audited financial statements referred to in 
Section 4.01(a)(ii) for the then most recently ended fiscal year, request in 
writing that the Termination Date be extended for an additional 364 days. 
After 

25
<PAGE> 26
the Company's request, each Lender may, in its sole discretion, consent or not
consent to such extension by giving written notice thereof to the
Administrative Agent within 21 days after receipt of an Extension Request.
Each Lender's annual decision as to whether to extend the Termination Date
shall be based, in part, on a new credit analysis utilizing then current
information in respect of the Company's business, financial condition and
operations and other information furnished by the Company. Failure of any
Lender to respond on or before such 21 day period shall be deemed to be a
refusal of such request by such Lender. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender and the Company of any Lender's decision to reject
the proposed extension.

(b) If, in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.15, a Lender consents to the extension to the Termination Date and the
Administrative Agent does not receive a Notice of Borrowing of the Term Loan
pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 2.16, the Termination Date for such Lender
shall be extended for 364 days from the then current Termination Date, without
any further action by the Company or such Lender.

(c) If any Lender does not consent to a request for an
extension of the Termination Date, or is deemed not to have consented to the
requested extension, and the Termination Date has been extended for the other
Lender(s): (i) the Company may, prior to the end of the nonextended Termination
Date, terminate such Lender's Commitment under this Agreement upon payment in
full of principal and interest on all Advances made by such Lender together
with such other sums, if any, that may be due by reason of such prepayment and
any fees owing to such Lender; (ii) if the Company has not previously
terminated such Lender's Commitment under this Agreement and has not previously
paid principal and interest on the Advances held by such Lender, then such
principal and interest shall be due and payable on the nonextended Termination
Date; and (iii) the Termination Date shall not be extended in so far as such
nonconsenting Lender is concerned.

(d) If any Lender does not consent to a request for an
extension of the Termination Date with respect to its Commitment under this
Agreement, or if any Lender is deemed not to have consented to the requested
extension, and the Administrative Agent receives a Notice of Borrowing of the
Term Loan pursuant to Section 2.16 not later than 11:00 a.m. New York City time
three Business Days prior to the nonextended Termination Date, the Termination
Date for all Lenders shall not be extended and the Term Loan shall be made, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

26

set forth in this Agreement to make Advances to the Company (upon request 
of the Company pursuant to this Agreement) on the Termination Date in
an amount up to the sum of (i) the outstanding principal amount of the Advances
made by such Lender and outstanding as of the opening of business on the
Termination Date plus (ii) the amount available to be borrowed from such Lender
as of the opening of business on the Termination Date. The aggregate of such
Advances is collectively called the "Term Loan".

(b) The Term Loan shall be made upon the irrevocable
written notice (including notice via facsimile confirmed immediately by a
telephone call) of the Company in the form of a Notice of Borrowing (which
notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
New York City time not less than three Business Days prior to the Termination
Date), specifying: (A) the amount of the Term Loan which shall be in a

Lenders as of the opening of business on the Termination Date; (B) whether the
Term Loan is to be comprised of Base Rate Advances or Eurodollar Advances, and
the amounts of such Advances; and (C) the Interest Period applicable to the
Advances included in such notice; provided, that, the Term Loan shall be made
only if the Company, in accordance with Section 2.15, shall have requested that
the then current Termination Date be extended.

(c) The proceeds of the Term Loan, to the extent required,
will be used to pay the principal amount of the Advances outstanding as of the
opening of business on the Termination Date.

SECTION 2.17. Evidence of Debt.
_________________

(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Company to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from
time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid

execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note (a "Note"),
substantially in the form of Exhibit F annexed hereto, to evidence such
Lender's Advances hereunder. The Borrower agrees promptly upon its receipt of
any such request from a Lender to execute and deliver a Note to such Lender.

of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the
meaning of Regulation U issued by the Board of Governors of the

for indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition
of TriCon), the obligations of the Company under this Agreement to pay
the principal of and interest on the Advances and any and all other
amounts due hereunder rank and will rank, as to payment and
security, at least pari passu with the highest ranking indebtedness
of the Company for borrowed money or under guarantees or in
respect of any indenture, contract, agreement or other instrument to
which the Company is a 

30

<PAGE> 31
party or by which it is bound evidencing or securing any obligation of

or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or other similar official 
for it or for any substantial part of its property, and if instituted 
against the Company, remains undismissed and unstayed for a period of 
60 days; or the Company shall take any corporate action to authorize 
any of the actions set forth above in this subsection (g); or

(h) (i) The Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates shall
fail to make full payment when due of all amounts which,
under the provisions of any Plan or Section 412 of the Code,
the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates is required to pay
as contributions thereto;

(ii) Any accumulated funding deficiency (as
defined in Section 412 of the Code) occurs or exists,
whether or not waived, with respect to any Plan; or

(iii) Any Termination Event with respect to a
Plan shall have occurred, and, 30 days after notice thereof
shall have been given to the Company by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, (i) such Termination Event (if
correctable) shall not have been corrected and (ii) the then
present value of such Plan's vested benefits exceeds the sum
of (A) the fair market value of the assets accumulated in
such Plan and (B) any related balance sheet accruals, by
more than $1,000,000 (or, in the case of a Termination
Event involving a "substantial employer" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(2) of ERISA), the withdrawing employer's
proportionate share of such excess shall exceed such amount);

then, and in any such event (other than an event described in subsection
(g) hereof), the Administrative Agent shall at the request, or may with
the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the Company, without
prejudice to the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to enforce
its claims against the Company, (i) declare the obligation of each Lender
to make Advances to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith
terminate, and (ii) cause all of the Advances, all interest thereon and all
other amounts payable under this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable,
whereupon all Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become
and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or

Company. If an Event of Default described in subsection (g) hereof occurs,
any obligation on the part of the Lenders hereunder shall automatically
terminate and all sums of principal, interest and fees remaining on the
Advances shall be 

44

ARTICLE VII
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND AGENTS

SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. 
_________________________

Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent and 
Agents to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such 
powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent 
and Agents by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably 
incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this 
Agreement, the Administrative Agent and Agents shall not be required to 
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or 
to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or 
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of Lenders having at least 51% 
of the Total Commitments and such instruction shall be binding upon all 
Lenders; provided, however, that neither the Administrative Agent nor any 
Agent shall be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative 
Agent or such Agent, as the case may be, to personal liability or which is 
contrary to this Agreement or applicable law.

SECTION 7.02. Agents' Reliance, Etc. 
______________________

None of the Administrative Agent, any Agent or any of their respective 
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken 
or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement,
except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Administrative Agent and Agents: (i) may treat the Lender making any Advance
as the holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts
an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such Lender, as assignor,
and an Eligible Assignee, in accordance with Section 8.04; (ii) may
consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Company), independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with this Agreement; (iv) shall not
have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of
any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the
Company or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the
Company, except as expressly set forth herein; (v) shall not be responsible
to any Lender for the due execution (other than its own due execution),
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of
this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this
Agreement by 

45
<PAGE> 46

acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument
or writing (which may be by telegram, telex or telecopy facsimile) believed by
it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.03. Citibank, BofA , Chemical, BofM, NatWest,
_________________________________________
any Agent and Their Affiliates. 
_______________________________

With respect to its Commitment and the Advances made by it, Citibank, BofA, 
BofM, Chemical, NatWest or any Agent, as the case may be, shall have the same 
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise 
the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or an Agent, as the 
case may be; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise 
expressly indicated, include each of Citibank, BofA, BofM, Chemical, NatWest 
and any Agent in its individual capacity. Citibank, BofA, BofM, Chemical, 
NatWest and each Agent and their respective affiliates may accept deposits 
from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage 
in any kind of business with, the Company, any of the Subsidiaries and any 
person or entity who may do business with or own securities of the Company or 
any Subsidiary, all as if Citibank, BofA, BofM, Chemical, NatWest or such 
Agent were not the Administrative Agent or an Agent, as the case may be, and 
without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. 
_______________________

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon 
the Administrative Agent, any Agent or any other Lender and based on the
financial statements referred to in Section 3.01 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. 
________________

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Agent 
(to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the 
respective amounts of the Advances then held by each of them (or if no 
Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective 
amounts of their Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, 
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, 
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be 
imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent or such 
Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action 
taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or such Agent under this Agreement,
provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's
or such 

46

<PAGE> 47
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation
of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent
and each Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, administration, or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent or such Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the
Company.

SECTION 7.06. Successor Agent. 
________________

The Administrative Agent and any Agent may resign at any time by giving written 
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Company and the Administrative Agent may 
be removed at any time with or without cause by Majority Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by Majority Lenders, and
if no successor Administrative Agent shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the removal of the retiring Administrative Agent by Majority
Lenders, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America
or of any State thereof and having combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000 or a Lender. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Except as otherwise
specifically designated herein, none of the Lenders identified on the
signature pages of this Agreement as an Agent shall have any right,
power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement
other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders so
identified as an Agent in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking
or not taking action hereunder.

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 8.01. No Waiver; Amendments. 
______________________

No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or 

47

<PAGE> 48

the Company in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or
power preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right or power hereunder. No amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by any
party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in
writing and consented to by the Majority Lenders and the Company (except
that no such amendment, modification, waiver or consent which would increase
any Lender's Commitment, reduce, or postpone any date fixed for any payment
of, principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder or change the percentage of the Commitments or of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Advances which shall be required
for the Lenders or any of them to take action hereunder (including, without
limitation, any amendment to the definition of "Majority Lenders" or this
Section 8.01) or which would affect any provision contained in Section 5.01,
Section 5.02 (if and to the extent that the Borrowing which is the subject of
such amendment, waiver or consent would involve an increase in the aggregate
amount of Advances over the aggregate amount of Advances outstanding
immediately prior to such Borrowing), Section 5.03, this Section 8.01 or
Section 8.05 shall be effective unless consented to by all Lenders then
having a Commitment) and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given;
provided, however, that the amount of any Lender's Commitment may be
raised by agreement in writing between the Company and such Lender, with
notice thereof to each other Lender then having a Commitment and to the
Administrative Agent. No amendment, modification or waiver of or consent with
respect to any provision contained in Article VII shall be effective
unless consented to by the Administrative Agent. No notice to or demand
on any party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

SECTION 8.02. New Lenders. 
____________

At any time when any Lender shall have a Commitment, if no event has occurred 
and is continuing which constitutes an Event of Default or which would 
constitute an Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given or 
time elapse or both, the Company may notify the Administrative Agent and the 
Lenders that it desires to add one or more additional lenders to the Lenders 
hereunder; provided, however, that no such new lender will have a Commitment 
larger than the largest Commitment of a Lender. Such notice shall identify 
each such lender, the amount of its proposed Commitment and the proposed 
effective date of its inclusion hereunder (which shall be the last day of all 
then current Interest Periods if there are Base Rate Advances or Eurodollar 
Advances then outstanding from the Lenders). Upon such proposed date, such 
lender shall become a Lender hereunder for all purposes and to the same effect 
as if set forth on the signature pages hereof, subject to its execution where 
indicated below and delivery to the Administrative Agent of at least one 
counterpart 

48

<PAGE> 49
of this Agreement (which shall be deemed to include all amendments thereto) and
the execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and the Company of each
such counterpart.

SECTION 8.03. Notices, Etc. 
_____________

All communications and notices provided for hereunder, unless otherwise 
specified in this Agreement, shall be in writing (including telecopier, 
telegraphic, telex or cable communication) and, if to the Company, mailed, 
telecopied, telegraphed, telexed, cabled or delivered to it, addressed to it 
at Dial Tower, Phoenix, Arizona 85077-1215 (Telecopier Number: (602) 207-5543), 
Attention of Treasurer's Department, and if to any Lender, mailed, telecopied, 
telegraphed, telexed, cabled or delivered to it, addressed to it at its 
Domestic Lending Office as set forth on the signature pages hereof, and, if to 
the Administrative Agent, mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed, cabled or 
delivered to it, addressed to it c/o Citicorp USA, Inc., 1 Sansome Street, 
San Francisco, California 94104 (Telecopier Number: (415) 433-0307), 
Attention: Cindy Lee; or, as to each party, at such other address as shall be 
designated by such party in a written notice to each other party. All such 
notices and communications shall, when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, 
telexed or cabled, be effective 5 days after deposited in the mails, when 
telecopied, when delivered to the telegraph company, when confirmed by telex 
answerback or when delivered to the cable company, respectively, except that 
notices and communications to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article II 
or VII shall not be effective until received by the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.04 Assignments, Participations etc.
________________________________

(a) Any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative
Agent and the Company, assign to any other current Lender, or, with notice
to the Administrative Agent and with the prior written consent of the Company
and the Administrative Agent, each of which consents shall not be unreasonably
withheld (it being understood and agreed that it shall not be considered
unreasonable to fail to consent to the assignment of all or any part of
the Advances or the Commitments or any other rights or obligations of
such Lender hereunder if such Lender's interests under the Long Term
Facility Credit Agreement are not proportionately assigned), assign to any
Eligible Assignee (each an "Assignee") all or any part of the Advances
or the Commitments or any other rights or obligations of such Lender
hereunder in a minimum amount of $5,000,000; provided, however, that the
amount of the Advances and the Commitment of the assignor Lender being
assigned may be in an amount equal to such assignor Lender's entire
Commitment and such Lender's entire outstanding Advances provided, further,
that the Company and the Administrative Agent may continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with the interests so assigned
to an Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment, together with
payment instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the
Assignee, shall have been given to the Company and the 

49
<PAGE> 50
Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Assignee and (ii) such
Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Company and the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit C
("Assignment and Acceptance"); and (iii) the processing fees of $2,500 shall
have been paid to the Administrative Agent (which fees shall also cover
concurrent assignments of such Lender's interests under the Long Term Facility
Credit Agreement). Any assignment hereunder shall be of a constant, and not a
varying, percentage of all rights and obligations of the assignor under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the preceding limitations on any Lender's
ability to assign any part of the Advances or the Commitments to any other
Person, each Lender may assign its rights (including, without limitation,
rights to payment) under this Agreement to any Federal Reserve Bank without
notice to or consent of, and without payment of any processing fee to, the
Company or the Administrative Agent. To facilitate any such pledge to a
Federal Reserve Bank, the Company will, as provided in Section 2.17(d), execute
and deliver to such Lender a Note to evidence such Advances.

(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the Assignee thereunder
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:
(i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such
assignor Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with any of this Agreement or the
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (ii) such assignor Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial
condition of the Company or the performance or observance by the Company of
any of its obligations under this Agreement or any instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such Assignee confirms that it has received
a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements
referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to
enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Agent or
such assignor Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v)
such Assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such Assignee
appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Agents to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent and the Agents by
the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vii) such Assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance
with their terms all of the 

50

<PAGE> 51

obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed 
by it as a Lender.

(c) From and after the date that the Administrative
Agent notifies the assignor Lender that it has received the Assignment
and Acceptance (which notice shall be promptly given by the
Administrative Agent), (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned
to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and (ii) the assignor Lender
shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned
by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and
be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of
the assignor Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its
address referred to in Section 8.03 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Company or any Lender at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
Immediately upon each assignee's making its payment under the Assignment
and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the
extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the
Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom.
The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of
the assignor Lender pro tanto.

(e) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more
Eligible Assignees or insurance companies (a "Participant") participating
interests in any Advances, the Commitment of that Lender or any other
interest of that Lender hereunder; provided, however, that (i) the
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the
Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) the Company and the Administrative Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with the Lender in connection with the Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (iv) no Lender shall
transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant
shall have rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver
with respect to this Agreement except to the extent such amendment,
consent or waiver would: (A) extend the Termination Date; or (B) reduce the
interest rate

51

<PAGE> 52
or the amount of principal or fees applicable to Advances or the
Commitments in which such participant is participating. In the case of any
such participation, the Participant shall not have any rights under this
Agreement and all amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be determined
as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except that if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been
declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in
respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to
the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.

(f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment
or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 8.04, disclose to the Assignee or participant or proposed
assignee or participant, any information relating to the Company and any
Subsidiary furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Company;
provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the Assignee or Participant or
proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the
confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Company or
any Subsidiary received by it from such Lender.

SECTION 8.05. Costs, Expenses and Taxes.
__________________________

(a) The Company agrees to pay all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Administrative Agent and each Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and any amendment,
waiver or consent relating thereto (including the reasonable fees and
out-of-pocket expenses of O'Melveny & Myers and the allocated costs of
internal counsel) and out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative
Agent, if any, including reasonable legal fees in connection with the
administration thereof and out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, if any, including reasonable legal
fees in connection with the enforcement thereof. In addition, the Company
shall pay any and all stamp and other taxes payable or determined to be
payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other documents to be delivered hereunder, and agrees to save the
Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all
liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission
to pay such taxes.

(b) Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consummated, the Company agrees to indemnify, pay and
hold the Administrative Agent, each Agent, each Lender, and the officers,
directors, employees and agents of the Administrative Agent, the Agents and
the Lenders, harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, costs and expenses (whether or not any of the foregoing
Persons is a party to any litigation), including without limitation 

52

<PAGE> 53
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and costs of investigation, with
respect to any acquisition or proposed acquisition or any other use or proposed
use of proceeds of the Advances (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"),
provided that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of any such Persons. If any claim is made, or any action, suit or proceeding
is brought against any Person indemnified pursuant to this Section 8.05(b), the
indemnified Person shall notify the Company of such claim or of the
commencement of such action, suit or proceeding, and the Company will assume
the defense of such action, suit or proceeding, employing counsel selected by
the Company and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified Person, and pay the
fees and expenses of such counsel; provided, however, that if counsel to the
Administrative Agent or the Person seeking indemnification hereunder shall
reasonably determine that, due to conflicts in the liabilities or defenses of
the Company and the Administrative Agent, the Agents and the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent, the Agents or the Lenders should retain their own
counsel, the Administrative Agent, the Agents and the Lenders shall have the
right to retain their own counsel and the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be for the account of the Company. The obligations of the
Company under this Section 8.05(b) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the discharge of the Company's other obligations hereunder.

SECTION 8.06. Right of Set-off. 
_________________

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each 
Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice 
to the Company (any such notice being expressly waived by the Company) and to 
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits 
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and 
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Company against any and all of the obligations of the Company
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement irrespective of whether or not
such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
Company and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application
made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each
Lender under this Section 8.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Lender may
have.

SECTION 8.07. Accounting Terms.

53

<PAGE> 54
under which action may be taken or consent or approval given by holders
of a specified percentage of the Lenders, the action taken or consent or
approval given by such percentage shall be binding upon all of the Lenders to
the same extent and with the same effect as if each Lender had joined therein.

SECTION 8.09. Several Obligations. 
____________________

Subject to Section 8.10 hereof, the obligation of each Lender hereunder is 
several, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be 
responsible for the obligation or Commitment of any other Lender hereunder, 
nor will the failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder 
relieve the other Lenders from the performance of their respective obligations 
hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by the 
Lenders pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders a partnership,
association, joint venture or other entity.

SECTION 8.10. Binding Effect. 
_______________

This Agreement shall become effective, upon satisfaction of the conditions set 
forth in Section 5.01, when it shall have been executed by the Company and when 
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Lender that such 
Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of the Company, the Administrative Agent hereunder and each of the 
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Company 
shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest 
herein without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders.

SECTION 8.11. Severability of Provisions. 
___________________________

Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions
in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 8.12. Descriptive Headings.

The descriptive headings of the several sections and subsections of this 
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect 
the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

laws of the State of New York.

SECTION 8.14. Execution in Counterparts.

SECTION 8.15. Waiver of Trial by Jury. 
________________________

THE COMPANY, THE LENDERS, THE AGENTS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH HEREBY 
AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF 
ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. The scope of this waiver 
is intended to be all- encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed

The Lenders
and Agents Listed
on Schedule I Hereto

Re: Greyhound Financial Corporation Credit Agreement
(Short Term Facility) dated as of May 16, 1994

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

As Vice President-General Counsel and Secretary of
Greyhound Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), I
am familiar with the Credit Agreement (Short Term Facility) dated as of May
16, 1994, among the Company, the Lenders named therein, the Agents named
therein, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, Bank of
Montreal, Chemical Bank and Citibank, N.A. and National Westminster Bank
USA, as Agents, and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "Credit
Agreement"). All terms used herein that are defined in the Credit
Agreement have the respective meanings specified in the Credit Agreement.
This letter is being delivered to you in satisfaction of the condition
set forth in Section 5.01(b) of the Credit Agreement and with the
understanding that you are entering into the Credit Agreement in reliance on
the opinions expressed herein.

In this connection, I have examined such certificates of
public officials, certificates of officers of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and copies certified to my satisfaction of corporate documents
and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries and of other papers, and have
made such other investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a
basis for my opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied upon such
certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and the
Subsidiaries with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters
contained therein which were not independently established.

D-1
<PAGE> 83
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications,
limitations and assumptions contained herein, it is my opinion that:

1. The Company is a corporation duly organized and
validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing under the laws of the State of Arizona. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and corporate authority to own and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to
be conducted and to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Agreement.

2. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Credit Agreement have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on the part of the Company. The Credit Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by authorized officers of the Company and constitutes
the legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

3. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

4. The extension, arranging and obtaining of the credit
represented by the Credit Agreement do not result in any violation of
Regulation G, T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

5. None of the execution and delivery of the Credit
Agreement, the making of any Advances thereunder or compliance with the
provisions thereof (A) conflicts with, or results in a breach or violation of
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (B) results in a
material breach or violation of, or constitutes a material default under, the
terms, conditions or provisions of (i) any material loan agreement or other
contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, (ii) any order,
writ judgment or decree that the Company or any Subsidiary is a party to
or by which any of the Company's or any Subsidiary's assets or properties
are bound and which is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or (iii) any present United States federal, Delaware corporate or
Arizona statute, rule or regulation, known to me to be applicable to or
binding on the Company and of a type commonly applicable to transactions of
the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement or (C) results in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the assets or properties of the Company or any
Subsidiary under any agreement or contract referred to in clause (B)(i) above.

D-2
<PAGE> 84
6. No governmental consents, approvals, registrations,
declarations or filings are required to be obtained or made by the Company in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

7. To the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits
or proceedings (administrative, judicial or otherwise) pending or threatened
against the Company or any Subsidiary which have a significant likelihood of
materially and adversely affecting (a) the business, operations,
prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations under the Credit Agreement, except as disclosed on Schedule II
hereto.

I am admitted to the bar in the State of Arizona, and I
express no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction except the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of
the United States of America. While the Credit Agreement is stated to be
governed by the laws of the State of New York, I have, with your
permission, expressed the opinions herein as if the Credit Agreement were
governed by the laws of the State of Arizona. With respect to such laws, my
opinions are what the law is at the date hereof, and I assume no
obligation to supplement this opinion due to any change in the law,
legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise.

To the extent that the obligations of the Company may be
dependent upon such matters, I have assumed for the purposes of this opinion
that each Person who is a party to the Credit Agreement (other than the
Company) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; that the Credit Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by each such Person (other than the
Company) and constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of each
such Person (other than the Company), enforceable in accordance with its
terms; the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of each
natural person executing the Credit Agreement (other than any such person
executing the Credit Agreement on behalf of the Company); the
authenticity and completeness of documents submitted as originals, and the
conformity of documents submitted as copies; that the Credit Agreement
accurately describes and contains the agreement and mutual understandings of
the parties, and that there are no verbal or written statements or agreements
that modify, amend or vary, or purport to modify, amend or vary, any of the
terms of the Credit Agreement; that you will receive no interest, charges,
fees or other benefits or compensation in the nature of interest in
connection with the Credit Agreement or its related transactions other than
those that the Company has agreed in writing to pay; that all parties to the
Credit Agreement will enforce their respective rights thereunder in
circumstances and in a manner which are commercially reasonable and in
accordance with applicable law; and that

D-3
<PAGE> 85
each Person who is a party to the Credit Agreement (other than the Company)
has the requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority to
perform is obligations under the Credit Agreement.

This opinion is being delivered upon the express instructions of
the Company to Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., Bank
of America National Trust and Savings Association, Bank of Montreal,
National Westminster Bank USA and Chemical Bank, as Agents and the
Lenders under the Credit Agreement and is solely for their benefit in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereby. This opinion may not
be relied upon by, filed with, disclosed to, quoted in any manner to,
referenced in any written report, financial statement or other document
to, or delivered to any other person, firm or corporation for any
purpose, without my prior written consent, except that the Administrative
Agent, each Agent and each Lender may use this opinion (i) in connection
with a review of the Credit agreement and transactions related thereto by a
regulatory agency having supervisory authority over any such Person for the
purpose of confirming the existence of this opinion, (ii) in connection with
the assertion of a defense as to which this opinion is relevant and necessary,
(iii) in response to a court order or (iv) in connection with any assignment
of any Advances or Commitment in accordance with the provisions of the
Credit Agreement, and any permitted assignee may rely on this opinion as if
it were addressed and had been delivered to such assignee on the date
hereof.

Very truly yours,
