Press Release dated March 15, 1994

PETRONAS CARIGALI AND TRITON FINALIZE AGREEMENTS FOR THE 
MALAYSIA-THAILAND JOINT DEVELOPMENT AREA

DALLAS--March 15, 1994--Triton Energy Corporation (NYSE: OIL) 
announced the finalization of agreements for commencement of
joint petroleum operations in Block A-18, located in the
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area. The Production
Sharing Contract (PSC) between the Malaysia-Thailand Joint
Authority (MTJA), Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Berhad [PETRONAS] the Malaysian
state oil company) and Triton Oil Company of Thailand (a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Triton Energy Corporation) will be
submitted to the Government of Malaysia and the Government of
the Kingdom of Thailand for approval.

Petronas Carigali and Triton each will hold a 50% interest in
Block A-18 and have agreed to form a joint operating company to
serve as operator under the PSC covering Block A-18. Petroleum
operations are anticipated to commence in June 1994 with the
acquisition of 5,750 kilometers of 2-D seismic data, to be
followed by exploration and appraisal drilling. A well drilled
in 1971 tested significant quantities of natural gas from Block
A-18. Since that discovery further petroleum operations were
suspended pending the creation of the MTJA and finalization of
related agreements.

Block A-18 which encompasses approximately 700,000 acres is
located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Thailand. 

Triton Energy, with headquarters in Dallas, is an international
independent oil and gas exploration and production company with
oil and gas interests in numerous countries.
