GRACE REPORTS 17 PERCENT RISE IN FIRST QUARTER
PER SHARE EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Boca Raton, Fla., April 28, 1994 -- W. R. Grace & Co. reported net
income of $38.2 million, or 41 cents per share, for the first quarter of 1994, a
per share increase of 17 percent, compared to $31.7 million, or 35 cents per
share from continuing operations in the first quarter of 1993. The year ago
quarter included a $3.4 million loss from discontinued operations which reduced
reported net income to $28.3 million or 31 cents per share. Sales for the
quarter rose 9 percent to $1,077 million, compared to $986 million in the year
earlier period.

"With the main phase of our restructuring program nearing completion,
our first quarter results provide further evidence that Grace can sustain solid
earnings growth," said J. P. Bolduc, president and chief executive officer.
"Health care, packaging and catalysts are strong. European earnings were
slightly ahead of the year-ago quarter based on improved results from catalysts,
construction and health care. Overhead reduction and productivity improvement
programs are ongoing."

During the 1994 first quarter, the Company recorded a pretax charge of
$40 million to provide for future environmental costs relating primarily to a
previously-divested business, as well as for the estimated costs of previously
announced workforce reductions at the Company's headquarters and its central
research and development facility. Offsetting the charge, and its related tax
benefit, was a $27 million pre and after-tax gain from the sale in January of
Grace's remaining interest in The Restaurant Enterprises Group.

Pretax earnings from specialty chemicals fell four percent to $40.1
million in the first quarter. While earnings from packaging, catalysts and
silicas, and construction products all rose from the year ago quarter on the
strength of increased volumes in most regions, earnings declines in water
treatment and container products more than offset the increases. Water
treatment was primarily impacted by economic weakness in Europe and Brazil, and
container products suffered volume weakness in all regions, primarily as the
result of competitive pressures.

Pretax earnings from health care businesses rose 26 percent to $43.7
million. Dialysis services benefited from continuing strong performance in the
U.S. as well as sharply higher international results. Earnings from the
homecare division also were strong, as it continues to benefit from growth in
base business as well as from recent strategic

acquisitions. These results more than offset increased costs in the medical
products group for compliance with FDA good manufacturing practices.
