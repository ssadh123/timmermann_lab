INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Item 2 Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On September 23, 1994, Fairfield Communities, Inc. (the "Company") 
completed the sale of 100% of the capital stock (the "Sale") of First 
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Charlotte ("First Federal") to 
Security Bank and Trust Company ("Security"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Security Capital Bancorp ("SCBC"). SCBC and Security have no material 
relationship to the Company or, to the best of the Company's knowledge, any 
of the Company's affiliates, any director or officer of the Company or any 
associate of any such director or officer of the Company. The Sale was 
approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's annual meeting of 
stockholders held on September 20, 1994 (the "Stockholders' Meeting"). The 
following discussion, insofar as it relates to matters contained in the 
Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 5, 1994, between the Company 
and SCBC (the "Agreement") is a summary only, is necessarily selective and 
therefore incomplete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 
full text of the Agreement, which was included as Appendix I to the proxy 
statement, dated August 4, 1994, for the Stockholders' Meeting (such full 
text of the Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference). On 
September 26, 1994, the Company issued a press release announcing the 
closing of the Sale. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as 
Exhibit 2.2 and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Summary of the Agreement

General Terms. Any words in this summary the initial letters of which 
are capitalized and that are not defined herein shall have the meanings 
given them in the Agreement.

The Agreement provides for the sale of all of the outstanding stock of 
First Federal to SCBC (or a subsidiary of SCBC, which SCBC designated as 
Security) for a purchase price of $40.35 million, increased (subject to the 
limitation hereafter described) to reflect the consolidated pretax net 
earnings (the "Pretax Earnings") of First Federal and its subsidiaries for 
the period from October 1, 1993 through the closing of the Sale (the 
"Purchase Price"). For purposes of determining the Purchase Price, the 
Pretax Earnings of First Federal and its subsidiaries were capped at $1.825 
million plus, in general, the pretax earnings or losses of First Federal 
and its subsidiaries from August 1, 1994 through the closing, provided that 
the foregoing amounts were reduced under certain circumstances for reserves 
taken or losses (in excess of gains) on Excluded Assets (as defined below) 
after September 30, 1993. The Purchase Price was estimated for purposes of 
closing to be approximately $41 million, and is subject to post-closing 
adjustment, based upon determination of actual Interim Period Earnings and 
other amounts effecting the calculation of the Purchase Price.

Immediately prior to closing, the Company purchased for cash (a) at 
book value, net of reserves, approximately $16 million of certain real 
estate, classified loans, joint venture interests and other assets owned by 
First Federal (the "Excluded Association Assets") and (b) lot and timeshare 
contract receivables and related assets, which First Federal previously 
acquired from the Company (the "Contracts Receivable"), having a net book 
value of approximately $41.6 million and a weighted average yield, on 
approximately $41.4 million ($39.8 million, net of certain reserves and 
allowances) of interest earning Contracts Receivable, of 11.7%. The 
Excluded Association Assets and the Contracts Receivable are collectively 
referred to as the "Excluded Assets".

Approximately $1.39 million of the Purchase Price was retained by 
Security to secure the Company's obligation to indemnify Security against 
three existing lawsuits/claims which have been asserted against First 
Federal (the "Litigation Indemnity"). In addition, approximately $2.95 
million in net book value of the Excluded Association Assets were pledged 
to Security to provide additional security with respect to both the 
Litigation Indemnity and the general indemnities under the Agreement. The 
Company has certain rights to substitute collateral in connection with such 
pledge, including the right to substitute $0.60 to $0.70 of cash for every 
$1.00 of net book value of Excluded Association Assets so pledged. 
Reserves taken by the Company after the closing on Excluded Association 
Assets securing the Litigation Indemnity may increase the total Excluded 
Association Assets required as collateral.

After the setoff of the Purchase Price against the purchase price for 
the Excluded Assets, and certain other adjustments, the Company paid 
approximately $17.7 million, on a net basis, in connection with the closing 
of the Sale. Under the Company's revolving credit agreements, in general, 
within applicable loan limits, $0.75 of additional borrowing availability 
is created for each $1.00 in outstanding principal balance of qualifying 
Contracts Receivable pledged to the Company's primary lender. The Company 
plans to dispose of certain of the Excluded Association Assets in one or 
more transactions and otherwise to monetize the remaining Excluded 
Association Assets. The Company is also considering an asset backed, fixed 
rate, private placement debt offering to institutional investors, 
securitized primarily by the Contracts Receivable, in order to reduce 
floating rate bank debt and generate additional short term liquidity.

Indemnification. The Company and Security have agreed to indemnify 
each other for a period of 913 days following the September 23, 1994 
closing date for certain breaches of their respective representations, 
warranties, covenants or undertakings provided for in the Agreement. In 
addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify Security and First Federal 
for the Litigation Indemnity, until such time as the three underlying 
litigation matters are finally resolved, and has agreed to indemnify 
Security and First Federal for excess severance benefit claims that may be 
asserted by certain of First Federal's employees, in the event of 
involuntary termination. The Company's indemnification obligation is 
secured by the grant to Security of security interests in certain Excluded 
Association Assets, as noted above.

FAIRFIELD COMMUNITIES, INC. COMPLETES SALE OF
FIRST FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION OF CHARLOTTE

LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, September 26, 1994 -- Fairfield Communities, Inc. 
(Nasdaq: FFCI) announced today that it has completed the sale of its First 
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Charlotte subsidiary to Security 
Capital Bancorp (Nasdaq: SCBC) for approximately $41 million.

The sale, a definitive agreement for which was executed in April 1994, 
was approved by Fairfield shareholders at the company's annual meeting held 
September 20, 1994, and is expected to result in a one-time gain of 
approximately $5 million in the third quarter ending September 30, 1994. 
The divestiture of First Federal represents one of the final steps in 
Fairfield's efforts to focus its business on its core vacation ownership 
operations.

John W. McConnell, Fairfield's President, commented, "The sale of First 
Federal allows us to more effectively deploy our capital in our higher-return 
vacation ownership business. Our efforts to concentrate on our core 
operations have been very successful, as evidenced by the 71% increase in 
vacation ownership revenues reported for the 1994 second quarter. Fairfield's 
existing properties are performing very well, and we are excited about the 
prospects of our second development in Branson, Missouri and our new project 
in Orlando, Florida."

Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, Fairfield has 
repurchased from First Federal lot and timeshare contracts receivable and 
related assets which First Federal previously acquired from Fairfield. At 
August 31, 1994, the contracts receivable had a net book value of 
approximately $39.8 million and a weighted average yield of 11.7%. Fairfield 
has also purchased certain real estate, classified loans, joint venture 
interests and other assets with a net book value at August 31, 1994, of 
approximately $16 million. Fairfield intends to either dispose of, or 
monetize, these assets. The company funded the purchase of selected assets 
and contracts receivable in part from the sale proceeds and in part from 
borrowings under a revolving credit agreement with The First National Bank 
of Boston.

First Federal, with total assets of approximately $298.2 million as of 
August 31, 1994, operates seven banking offices in Charlotte, North Carolina 
and three offices in the communities of Biscoe, Rockingham and Troy.

Fairfield Communities, Inc., incorporated in 1969, is one of the nation's 
largest vacation ownership companies. Fairfield and its subsidiaries operate 
14 resort and home developments in ten states, providing a combination of 
vacation products, recreational facilities, homesites, primary and secondary 
residences to over 121,500 Fairfield property owners.
