Item 5. Other Materially Important Events

The Company has previously reported in its Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 1992, the existence of
three purported class action complaints filed in state
courts in Jefferson County, Texas against the Company and
its directors (collectively, "Defendants") relating to
the proposed business combination between the Company and
Entergy Corporation (Entergy). The Company has executed
a Memorandum of Understanding with counsel for the
plaintiffs in these suits agreeing in principle to settle
such actions subject to execution of an appropriate
stipulation of settlement, approval by the court and
certain other conditions. In the Memorandum, the
Defendants have denied any actionable acts or omissions
and state that they have entered into the Memorandum
solely to eliminate the burden and expense of further
litigation and to facilitate the consummation of the
business combination. The Memorandum memorialized
certain agreements by the Company and Entergy for the
benefit of shareholders principally in the event the
business combination were not consummated, including a
covenant to consider reinstitution of dividends on the
common stock of the Company in such event. The business
combination was consummated on December 31, 1993. 
Incident to the settlement, the Defendants agreed not to
oppose an application for attorneys' fees by plantiffs'
counsel which do not exceed $500,000.00 or for an award
of expenses not to exceed $50,000.00.
