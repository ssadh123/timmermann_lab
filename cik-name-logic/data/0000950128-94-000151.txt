</TABLE>

NOTE: The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of
June 30, 1994 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements
for the six-month periods ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, and for the three years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, give effect to the merger of Mellon
Bank Corporation (Mellon) and The Dreyfus Corporation (Dreyfus) consummated on
August 24, 1994, accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. The pro forma
information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of
Dreyfus and Mellon and their subsidiaries reflecting the adjustments set forth
in the accompanying notes.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have
been prepared by the managements of Dreyfus and Mellon based upon their
respective consolidated financial statements. Pro forma earnings per common
share amounts are based on the Exchange Ratio of 0.88017 shares of Mellon
common stock for each share of Dreyfus common stock. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined income statements, which include results of operations as if
the merger had been consummated on January 1, 1991, do not reflect the merger
expenses or the losses on the disposition of securities available for sale
recorded following the consummation of the merger, or the cost savings
anticipated to result from the merger. As a result, the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements may not be indicative of the results
that actually would have occurred if the merger had been in effect during the
periods presented or which may be attained in the future. Results for the
interim period are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the year
as a whole. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto of Dreyfus and Mellon.

* This pro forma condensed combined income statement is presented as if Mellon's
acquisition of The Boston Company, Inc. (TBC) had been effective January 1, 
1993 as shown in further detail in Mellon's Second Quarter 1993 Form 10-Q 
dated as of August 6, 1993 and filed August 10, 1993. The first column 
above combines TBC's results of operations for the period January 1, 1993, 
through May 20, 1993, and Mellon's results of operations for the six months 
ended June 30, 1993, which included TBC's results of operations from May 21,
1993 to June 30, 1993. The first column also reflects a number of 
assumptions relating to the funding of the purchase price, the issuance of 
Mellon common stock and warrants, the amortization of goodwill, the 
elimination of $175 million of nonrecurring merger expenses recorded by 
Mellon and other adjustments, as further explained in Mellon's Second 
Quarter 1993 Form 10-Q. The elimination of such nonrecurring merger 
expenses and certain other adjustments are not reflected in the pro forma 
condensed combined income statements of Mellon and Dreyfus presented on 
pages 3 and 4. Accordingly, the pro forma information presented above is 
not directly comparable to the information contained in the pro forma 
condensed combined income statements on pages 3 and 4. The above data are 
presented for informational purposes only and are not indicative of the

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
(a) The Dreyfus historical income statement and balance sheet 
classifications presented herein were reclassified to be consistent 
with the presentation used by Mellon.

Mellon adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(FAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," on a prospective
basis beginning in 1993. Dreyfus adopted FAS 109 on a prospective
basis beginning in 1992. No adjustments were made to the pro forma
condensed combined financial statements to conform Dreyfus' financial
statements to Mellon's for 1992. The effect of adopting FAS 109 on
both Mellon's 1993 and Dreyfus' 1992 financial statements was not
material.

FAS 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,"
was issued in May 1993, and is required for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1994, with earlier application permitted. FASB
Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contracts," was issued in March 1992, and is required for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993, with earlier application permitted. 
Neither Dreyfus nor Mellon had adopted FAS 114 through June 30, 1994. 
Both Dreyfus and Mellon adopted FASB Interpretation No. 39 effective
January 1, 1994.

(b) Pro forma adjustments to common stock, additional paid-in capital and
treasury stock at June 30, 1994 reflect the combination of Dreyfus 
and Mellon, accounted for as a pooling-of-interests, through the 
assumed exchange of 32.2 million shares of Mellon common stock at 
June 30, 1994 for all outstanding shares of Dreyfus common stock at 
an exchange ratio of 0.88017 shares of Mellon common stock for each 
share of Dreyfus common stock and the retirement of Dreyfus common 
stock held in Dreyfus' treasury. Under generally accepted accounting
principles, the book values of the assets and liabilities of Dreyfus 
were combined with those of Mellon. In addition, the income 
statements of Dreyfus were combined with the income statements of 
Mellon on a retroactive basis.

(c) Pro forma weighted average shares and common stock equivalents
for the six-month periods ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, and
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 reflect
the conversion of each share of outstanding Dreyfus common stock and
common stock equivalent that is dilutive to net income per share
computations to 0.88017 shares of Mellon common stock.

(d) The pro forma condensed combined income statements do not reflect 
the $104 million or, $79 million after-tax, of merger expenses 
and $15 million or, $10 million after-tax, on losses on the disposition
of securities available for sale which were recorded in the quarter
the merger was consummated, since these items are nonrecurring. Merger 
expenses include: $25 million of expense related to the write-down of
certain facilities and assets; $42 million of expense primarily 
related to estimated required payouts due under pre-existing 
employee benefit programs and severance programs; and $37 million 
of expense related to professional fees, proxy solicitation 
and other expenses.

From July 1, 1994, through September 30, 1994, Dreyfus sold
securities available for sale and other investments that Mellon
Bank was not permitted to hold or that did not fit the interest rate
or credit risk characteristics required by Mellon. Such securities and
investments had been carried at $322 million and were sold for $307
million, for a $15 million pre-tax loss ($10 million after-tax loss);
the adjustments to the pro forma balance sheet reflects these sales.
The loss did not impact total equity since Dreyfus' June 30, 1994
equity had included a mark-to-market adjustment, in accordance with
FAS No. 115. The $307 million proceeds on sales were used to reduce
short-term borrowings.

(e) The pro forma adjustments to the liabilities and equity of the
condensed combined balance sheet also reflects the issuance of Mellon
common stock to holders of options and "Book Value" shares under the 
Dreyfus 1982 Incentive Stock Option Plan. This issuance was recorded 
as a $4 million increase to common stock and additional paid-in 
capital, a reversal of the $1 million liability recorded to reflect 
book value appreciation expensed to date, and a $3 million charge 
to retained earnings.
