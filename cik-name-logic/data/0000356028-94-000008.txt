Item 5 Other Events.
-------------

The Registrant and certain of its officers were
defendants in a consolidated class action complaint brought on July
12, 1990 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New
York (Civil Action No. CV-90-2398 (JBW)) alleging that a class
consisting of all persons who purchased the Registrant's stock
during a period prior to July 12, 1990, the day the Registrant's
stock price fell following the announcement of preliminary results
for the first quarter of fiscal 1991, were harmed by misleading
statements and representations regarding the Registrant's future
financial performance.

On June 1, 1994, the Registrant announced that a jury
verdict was returned in favor of the Registrant and its officers on
all counts.
