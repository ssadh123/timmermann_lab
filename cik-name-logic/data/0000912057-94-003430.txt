FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tues., October 18, 1994

WELLS FARGO REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $217 MILLION;
PER SHARE EARNINGS $3.86 VS. $2.74 A YEAR AGO

Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) today reported net income of $217 million for
the third quarter of 1994, compared with $165 million for the third quarter of
1993, an increase of 32 percent. Per share earnings for the third quarter of
1994 were $3.86, compared with $2.74 in the third quarter of 1993, an increase
of 41 percent. A significant portion of the increase in net income from a year
ago was due to a lower loan loss provision. The percentage increase in per
share earnings was greater than the percentage increase in net income due to the
company's continuing stock repurchase program.

Return on average assets (ROA) was 1.65 percent and return on average
common equity (ROE) was 22.99 percent in the third quarter of 1994. In the
year-ago period, ROA was 1.29 percent and ROE was 17.75 percent.

"During the past quarter, credit quality has continued to improve," said
Chairman Carl E. Reichardt. "This is encouraging, but we are still closely
monitoring our underwriting standards in view of the highly competitive market
for new loan volume." Loan balances increased 4 percent since the end of the
third quarter of 1993, rising to $34.951 billion from $33.606 billion.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $656 million in the
third quarter of 1994, flat with $656 million a year ago. The company's net
interest margin for the third quarter of 1994 was 5.53 percent, down from 5.65
percent in the same quarter of 1993. A major portion of the decrease was due to
higher funding costs.

Noninterest income in the third quarter of 1994 was $307 million, compared
with $264 million in the same quarter of 1993, an increase of 16 percent. The
increase was primarily due to a $36 million accrual related to the disposition
of owned and leased premises that reduced noninterest income in the third
quarter of 1993. A $13 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts
and a $12 million increase in mutual fund and annuity sales fees also
contributed to the increase.

Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 1994 was $531 million, down 1
percent from $535 million in the same quarter of 1993. A decline in foreclosed
assets expense was largely offset by a higher level of incentive compensation.

The provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 1994 was $50 million,
compared with $120 million in the third quarter of 1993. Continued improvement
in the company's loan portfolio resulted in the reduction of the provision.

Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 1994 totaled $60 million, or .69
percent of average total loans (annualized). The largest categories of net
charge-offs were credit card loans ($29 million) and real estate mortgage loans
other than 1-4 family ($16 million). For the third quarter of 1993, net charge-
offs totaled $121 million, or 1.42 percent of average total loans (annualized).
The largest categories of net charge-offs were real estate mortgage loans other
than 1-4 family ($42 million) and credit card loans ($38 million).

At September 30, 1994, the allowance for loan losses equaled 6.04 percent
of total loans, compared with 6.20 percent at June 30, 1994 and 6.32 percent at
September 30, 1993.

At September 30, 1994, total nonaccrual and restructured loans decreased to
$641 million (1.8 percent of total loans), of which an estimated 39 percent were
current as to payment of principal and interest. This compares with $717
million (2.1 percent of total loans) at June 30, 1994, of which an estimated 34
percent were current, and $1.702 billion (5.1 percent of total loans) at
September 30, 1993, of which an estimated 52 percent were current. Foreclosed
assets were $306 million at September 30, 1994, compared with $344 million at
June 30, 1994 and $357 million at September 30, 1993.

During the third quarter of 1994, an estimated $16 million of cash interest
payments were received from all loans that were on nonaccrual during the
quarter. Of that amount, $4 million was recognized as interest income and $12
million was used to reduce book loan balances. The average nonaccrual book loan
balance (net of charge-offs and interest applied to principal) was $662 million
for the quarter. The estimated average cash yield was 9.6 percent.

During the second quarter of 1994, an estimated $18 million of cash
interest payments were received from all loans that were on nonaccrual during
the quarter. Of that amount, $7 million was recognized as interest income and
$11 million was used to reduce book loan balances. The average nonaccrual book
loan balance (net of charge-offs and interest applied to principal) was $830
million for the quarter. The estimated average cash yield was 8.7 percent.

At September 30, 1994, the company's preliminary risk-based capital ratios
were 13.90 percent for total risk-based capital and 9.60 percent for Tier 1
risk-based capital, exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines of 8 percent and
4 percent, respectively. At June 30, 1994, these risk-based capital ratios were
14.56 percent and 10.06 percent, respectively. The decrease in total and Tier 1
risk-based capital ratios between June 30, 1994 and September 30, 1994 resulted
primarily from the repurchase of 1,465,125 shares of common stock during the
quarter (net of 312,473 shares issued under employee benefit and dividend
reinvestment programs). At September 30, 1993, the company's total risk-based
capital ratio was 14.60 percent and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.91
percent. The ratio of common equity to total assets at September 30, 1994 was
6.77 percent, compared with 6.96 percent at June 30, 1994 and 6.81 percent at
September 30, 1993.
