Item 5. Other Events.

On February 25, 1994, Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. issued the
following press release:

A&A REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER PROFIT OF $0.03 PER SHARE

AND FULL-YEAR PROFIT OF $0.48;

BOARD DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.25 PER SHARE

NEW YORK, Feb. 25 -- Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. (A&A) today reported 
net income of $3.2 million, or $0.03 per share, for the quarter ended 
December 31, 1993. 
For the comparable 1992 quarter, A&A reported a net loss of $137.4 
million, or $3.18 per share. The 1992 fourth quarter included a $157.5 
million, or $3.61 per share, special charge related to discontinued or sold 
underwriting operations as well as a $0.26 per share gain on the sale of a 
non-core U.K.-based pension fund management operation.
Consolidated operating revenues of $347.8 million for the 1993 fourth 
quarter compares to $345.1 million for the same year-ago period. After 
adjusting for lower foreign exchange rates and operations that were sold in 
1992, this represents an increase of 3.3 percent.
In a separate action, A&A's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly
dividend of $0.25 per share, payable March 31, 1994, to shareholders of 
record on March 17. 
The fourth quarter results primarily reflect lower earnings by the 
Alexander Consulting Group as well as the expected cost of settling certain 
litigation and related claims brought against the company. These factors 
were partially offset by lower income taxes, primarily due to the recognition

of capital-loss carryforwards. T.H. Irvin, chief executive officer, said, 
"As previously announced, we installed new ACG management late last year. 
The new leadership is moving aggressively to restore competitiveness, growth 
and earnings. We see substantial progress already and expect that the 
turnaround will continue through 1994."
Robert E. Boni, chairman of the board, said, "The fourth quarter 
results make it abundantly clear that we must press ahead with our plans to 
improve operations and enhance shareholder return."
Dr. Boni added, "The business environment has changed dramatically for
A&A, and it is clear that the company must also change. A&A has an excellent
global franchise, sound core businesses, and highly professional people who 
are serving a very substantial client base. We intend to build on this 
foundation."
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $340.2 million compared to
$326.8 million in 1992. After adjusting for foreign exchange variances and sold
operations, operating expenses increased by 7 percent, reflecting higher 
insurance and professional fees expenses.
Other net non-operating expenses in the 1993 fourth quarter were $9 
million higher than 1992. This reflects certain costs associated with the 
previously cited legal settlement as well as non-recurring 1992 transactions,
including the $16.7 million gain on the sale of a U.K. operation and a $12.5 
million special charge relating to sold underwriting operations.

1993 Full Year Results
Net income for the year ended December 31, 1993, was $26.9 million, or
$0.48 per share, compared to a net loss of $88.0 million, or $2.03 per share,
for the full year of 1992.

<PAGE>

Consolidated operating revenues for 1993 were $1,341.6 million 
compared to $1,369.5 million for 1992. The decline in revenue was primarily 
due to lower foreign exchange rates and lost revenues from operations sold in
1992. Excluding these factors, revenues increased by 2.8 percent in 1993 
over 1992.
Operating expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 1993, increased
5.7 percent to $1,289.3 million from $1,284.0 million in 1992, after 
adjusting for exchange rate variances and expenses of sold operations.
Net non-operating expenses were $37.8 million higher in 1993 versus 1992,
primarily due to $43.8 million of gains on sales of businesses and a $16.5 
million special charge, both of which occurred in 1992. Also contributing to
the comparison were significantly higher 1993 litigation costs.
In November 1993, A&A issued 2.3 million shares of common stock to 
acquire Clay & Partners, a U.K.-based actuarial and employee benefits 
consulting operation. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of 
interests, and accordingly financial results have been restated for periods 
prior to the acquisition.
A&A Services Inc. [NYSE: AAL] is a global organization of professional
advisers providing risk management, insurance brokerage and human resource 
management consulting services from offices in more than 80 countries.
