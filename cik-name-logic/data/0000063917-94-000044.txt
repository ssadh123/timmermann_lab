In the United States Court of Federal Claims

McDonnell Douglas Corporation and
General Dynamics Corporation,

Plaintiffs, No. 91-1204C
-----------

v. Filed: December 9, 1994

United States of America,

Defendant.
---------

ORDER

Plaintiffs allege in Count XVII that they were improperly
terminated for default. We held trial beginning September 1993
and agreed to defer substantive rulings to facilitate settlement
negotiations. The Navy urged further delay in July, and
plaintiffs objected. Additional delay in ruling on Count XVII is
not warranted.

Testimony and other evidence at trial showed that the A-12
contract was not terminated because of contractor default. The
contract was terminated because the Office of the Secretary of
Defense withdrew support and funding from the A-12. Prior to
that, the Navy did not believe that the contractors' performance
justified termination for default.

Detailed findings of fact will be submitted following trial
on the remaining issues. The decision terminating the contract
for default was not properly made and therefore is VACATED.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
