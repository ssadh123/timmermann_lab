Signet Banking Corporation
Announces Plans for Credit Card Spin-off

RICHMOND, VA (July 27, 1994) - Today, Signet Banking Corporation filed
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an
initial public offering of up to a 19.9 percent interest in a newly formed
corporation that will house Signet's national credit card business. 

Signet stated that the initial public offering could be completed by
early fall. Signet intends to follow this offering with a tax-free
distribution to Signet shareholders of its remaining interest in the credit
card company. This distribution could be completed as early as year-end
1994. The new credit card company will apply for a listing on the New York
Stock Exchange. 

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Smith Barney Inc.
will act as managing underwriters of the offering.

"This is a milestone event for our company in which we take great pride
- - marking the culmination of an extensive 12-month review by our Board of
Directors and senior management team," said Robert M. Freeman, chairman and
chief executive officer of Signet Banking Corporation. 

"In 1988, we began investing in technology that would enable us to
become a state-of-the-art, unique provider of financial products and
services. We successfully achieved this objective in our credit card
division, and with the spin-off, we will be able to concentrate fully on
improving the business strategies of our Core Bank. The transactions we
are announcing today will enhance shareholder value by creating two strong
and independent financial institutions," Freeman said.

Richard D. Fairbank, who heads Signet's credit card division, will
serve as chief executive officer of the new credit card bank. When the
spin-off is complete, Fairbank will assume the additional title of
chairman. Signet's existing management committee will remain at Signet,
and will oversee the plans the company has developed for its core banking
businesses.

Page 10 of 12

"This initiative is the result of a great team effort at Signet on
behalf of the shareholders," Fairbank said. "We are excited by the
opportunities and challenges of continuing innovative financial strategies
in the new company. We have named the new company OakStone Financial
Corporation reflecting its financial strength and stability."

Signet's credit card business is one of the 15 largest issuers of
MasterCard and VISA credit cards in the United States, as measured by loan
outstandings. As of June 30, 1994, Signet had about 4 million accounts and
$6.6 billion in managed loans outstanding.

The new credit card company will be headquartered in Northern Virginia
with operations centers in Richmond and Fredericksburg, VA. Signet's Board
of Directors will serve as the interim board of the new card company until
the spin-off is complete and a separate board is established.

Signet also announced that it intends to implement a comprehensive core
bank improvement program that will focus on cost reductions and revenue
initiatives. Signet expects to take special one-time charges during the
third quarter in connection with cost reduction measures (an early
retirement plan and employee severance) and termination of certain data
processing services related to the separation of the credit card business. 
It is estimated that these charges in the aggregate may range between $60
and $70 million on a pretax basis. 

Revenue initiatives will include the development of selected national
product strategies in the areas of student lending, equity and mortgage
lending, and installment lending. Signet plans to apply the experience it
has gained in the use of information-based technology as it continues to
redefine its core banking business.

"Throughout this year and next, we will reinvent Signet Bank one
process and one product at a time with the goal of delivering maximum long-
term value to our customers and our shareholders," stated Malcolm S.
McDonald, Signet's president and chief operating officer.

"We will turn what is already a very good banking franchise into a
'Best Bank'," Freeman added. "We've done it before, and we'll do it again. 
Signet has a proud 73-year history of serving our customers and
communities, and we will continue in that proud and independent tradition
as we look toward what we believe to be a very promising future."

Signet Banking Corporation is a $10.8 billion organization comprised of
five lines of business, including Bank Card, Consumer Banking, Capital
Markets, Commercial Banking and Real Estate Lending. Signet has gained
national prominence as one of the fastest-growing credit card issuers in
the United States. With 240 full-service banking offices throughout
Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia and a 24-hour Telebanking
center, Signet provides a full array of investment, credit, cash
