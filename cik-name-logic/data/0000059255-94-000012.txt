DALLAS, TEXAS . . . . . July 6, 1994 . . . . Valhi, Inc. announced that
it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding concerning the sale of its
wholly-owned subsidiary, The Amalgamated Sugar Company, to the Snake River Sugar
Company, an agricultural cooperative comprised of sugarbeet growers in Idaho,
Oregon and Washington. The sales price is $325 million in cash. The transaction
is contingent upon, among other things, the Snake River Sugar Company obtaining
adequate bank financing and grower commitments, and execution of a definitive
purchase agreement. 

George Grant, Chairman of the Growers' Cooperative stated that all
representatives on the 25 member growers "Steering Committee" enthusiastically
support the concept of grower ownership from production through the processing
and selling of sugar and by-products. "We in agriculture should consider this
an appropriate time and a unique opportunity to ensure a profitable future for
the sugar industry in Idaho, Oregon and Washington, and hope that the terms of
the transaction can be finalized before the end of the year ", said Grant. 
Lou Wettstein, Rocky Trail, and Myron Huettig, who are members of the grower
Executive Committee stated that there is broad support for this concept of
ownership. 

Allan M. Lipman, Jr., Amalgamated's President predicted that the
culmination of this transaction will further strengthen and enhance the economic
impact of sugar in Idaho , Oregon and Washington. He praised the grower
leadership for their initiative which corresponds to similar farmer movements
throughout the United States. 

Snake River was formed by members of the Idaho Sugarbeet Growers
Association, Nyssa-Nampa Beet Growers Association, and Elwyhee Beet Growers
Association for the express purpose of acquiring Amalgamated and converting 
the corporation into an agricultural cooperative. Roy Ruff, one of the
leaders instrumental in forming the group, said that Amalgamated was the
nation's premier sugar company and that Snake River would build upon its rich
history in Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

Valhi, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a diversified industrial
management company engaged in the refined sugar, forest products, fast food and
hardware products industries. Valhi is also engaged in the chemicals and
titanium metals industries through its equity interests in two publicly-held
affiliates, NL Industries, Inc. and Tremont Corporation. Valhi's common stock is
traded on the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges under the symbol "VHI".
