ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As previously reported, on July 11, 1994 the

Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court reversed a March 1993 rate order

of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission permitting

Metropolitan Edison Company ("Met-Ed") to recover from customers

certain future Three Mile Island Unit No. 2 retirement costs.

Consequently Met-Ed and Pennsylvania Electric Company ("Penelec")

have recorded pre-tax charges to income in the quarter ended June

30, 1994 totaling $183.9 million.

As a result of the Commonwealth Court decision, on

August 9, 1994, Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P") downgraded

its credit ratings for Met-Ed's and Penelec's first mortgage

bonds and cumulative preferred stock. S&P has assigned new

ratings of BBB+ to Met-Ed's first mortgage bonds and BBB to its

cumulative preferred stock and shelf registration of monthly

income preferred securities. The previous ratings were A- and

BBB+, respectively. S&P similarly lowered Penelec's credit

ratings by one category -- from A to A- for first mortgage bonds

and from A- to BBB+ for cumulative preferred stock and shelf

registration of monthly income preferred securities. S&P also

revised its outlooks for both Met-Ed and Penelec from "negative"

to "stable".

S&P did not change its ratings or outlook for Jersey

Central Power & Light Company ("JCP&L").

As previously reported in August 1994, Moody's

Investors Service ("Moody's") also downgraded the credit ratings

of Met-Ed's and Penelec's senior securities by one category, and

in addition, downgraded JCP&L's senior securities by one category

as well. Duff & Phelps has not changed the credit ratings for

the three companies following the Commonwealth Court decision.

As a result of these actions, S&P and Moody's have now assigned

equivalent ratings to the GPU subsidiaries, while Duff & Phelps

rates the senior securities of Met-Ed and Penelec one category

higher.
