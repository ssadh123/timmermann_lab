On January 4, 1994, Lone Star Industries, Inc. made public
disclosure of the following by a press release for immediate
release:

Stamford, Connecticut, January 4, 1994 --- Lone Star
Industries,Inc.(NYSE/LCE) said today that a preliminary
tally of the ballots voting on the Company's Plan of
Reorganization indicated that all parties in interest in the
bankruptcy proceedings had voted overwhelmingly in favor of
the Plan. The preliminary count indicates that holders of
approximately $2 million of Secured Claims (98% of total
dollars voting); $443 million of Unsecured Claims (95% of
total dollars voting); approximately 379 thousand shares of
Preferred Stock (99% of shares voting); and approximately 6
million shares of Common Stock (79% of shares voting) had
voted for the Plan of Reorganization.

The Bankruptcy Court responsible for Lone Star's Chapter 11
proceedings has set February 9, 1994 as the date for a
confirmation hearing on the Company's Plan. A hearing to
consider the adequacy of a disclosure statement relating to
a plan of reorganization proposed by the common stock
representatives of the Official Committee of Equity Holders
is scheduled for January 10, 1994. Objection to the Equity
Committee Disclosure Statement have been filed by the major
constituencies involved in the Lone Star Bankruptcy. Both
hearings will be held before the Honorable Judge Tina L.
Brozman in the United States Bankruptcy Court at Bowling
Green in New York City.

Lone Star Industries, Inc. is a leading producer of cement,
ready-mixed concrete, sand and gravel, crushed stone, and
other construction materials.
