NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-QSB of Regulation S-B. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a
fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the six month
period ended June 30, 1994, are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ended December 31, 1994. For further information,
refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in
Commercial's' annual report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31,
1993.

A description of the pro forma adjustments made to the unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial information is as follows:

The capital accounts have been reclassified to give effect for the exchange of
all 337,077 outstanding shares of Hometown Bancshares, Inc. common stock for
Commercial BancShares, Inc common stock on the basis of 1.512 shares of
Commercial for each share of Hometown. This reclassification between common
stock and paid in capital is a result of the difference in the par value of
Hometown's shares received versus the par value of Commercial's shares issued.
In addition, this transaction will be accounted for under the pooling of
interest method therefore, no adjustments to the income or expense accounts as
a result of this combination are necessary.

NOTE 7: CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

In conjunction with the acquisition of Jackson County Bank, Ravenswood,
West Virginia, Commercial issued 28,764 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to
former owners of Jackson County Bank Common Stock. The Convertible Preferred
has a stated value of $100 per share and pays cumulative dividends of $10.00 per
share per year, paid quarterly. Shares of Convertible Preferred are convertible
by the holders into 7.332 shares of Commercial Common Stock at any time.
Convertible Preferred may be redeemed during 1994 at $105 per share, and after
January 1, 1995, at $100 per share. Holders of Convertible Preferred vote as a
class on the election of two members of Commercial's Board of Directors as long
as more than 13,673 shares of Convertible Preferred remain outstanding.
Thereafter one member of the Board will be elected by holders of Convertible
Preferred as long as any shares remain outstanding. To date, 1,599 shares of
Convertible Preferred stock have been converted to Commercial Common Stock.

The entire issue of Convertible Preferred Stock will be redeemed for cash
on October 28, 1994 at $105 per share. A redemption notice was mailed to
holders of Convertible Preferred Stock on September 1, 1994. Management expects
holders will elect to convert their Convertible Preferred Stock to Common Stock
prior to the redemption date, and anticipates issuing up to 199,173 shares of
common stock in exchange.
