Item 5. Other Events

(a)
On November 16, 1994, Registrant issued the following press release:

Caesars World, Inc. (NYSE/CAW) today announced net income for
its fiscal 1995 first quarter was $23,184,000, or 94 cents
per share, compared with net income of $27,848,000, or $1.14
per share, in the same quarter of fiscal 1994. 

Earnings per share in the fiscal 1994 first quarter had
established a record for any quarter in the company's
history.

Revenue for the fiscal 1995 quarter ended October 31,
1994, totaled $252,511,000, compared with $269,083,000 in the
same quarter of fiscal 1994.

The company said a significantly lower table-game win
percentage from its Nevada operations was the principal
factor in the revenue and earnings decline from the
yearearlier quarter.

In its Nevada operations, the company realized all-time
quarterly slot machine records in both volume of play and
slots win. However, losses to a small number of
highwagering, table-game customers resulted in a win
percentage that was 7.9 percentage points lower than the
fiscal 1994 first-quarter, table-game win percentage. The
fiscal 1995 quarter's lower win percentage, combined with
lower tablegame activity, more than offset the slots results
when comparing the first quarters. The slots improvement was
largely attributable to enhanced marketing programs. The
company's Nevada operations also had a lower provision for
bad debt and decreased operating expenses when comparing the
respective quarters.

In New Jersey, Caesars Atlantic City realized its
alltime record quarter in both casino activity and win. 
Record results from the resort's slot machines were the
primary contributors to the improvement. Another positive
impact on the quarterly comparisons came from Caesars
Atlantic City's Simulcast Casino which opened with horse race
betting and poker in October of the fiscal 1994 first quarter
and subsequently introduced other games during the fiscal
year. Increased casino costs and higher marketing expenses,
primarily related to casino busing programs, partially offset
the casino revenue increase in New Jersey.

During the fiscal 1995 first quarter, the company also
had a positive contribution to earnings from an
unconsolidated affiliate in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Caesars
World has a one-third interest in a joint venture operating
a casino which opened in Windsor during May 1994.
