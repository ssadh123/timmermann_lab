Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Effective November 17, 1994, Grubb & Ellis Company (the "Company") sold certain
assets related to its Southern California residential brokerage operations to
Newco Realty Corporation (the "Buyer"). The Company had operated nine
residential brokerage offices in Southern California. Primary consideration for
the transaction was the assumption by the Buyer of the Company's obligations, in
full, under certain real property and equipment leases related to the sold
operations. In addition, the Buyer entered into an agreement to pay the Company
a portion of the real estate commissions to be received from certain pending
real estate transactions and listings and made a cash payment representing the
proration of certain prepaid expenses.

Set forth below are unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations of Grubb & Ellis Company for the year ended December 31, 1993, which
give effect to the disposition of its Southern California residential brokerage
operations as if the disposition had occurred on January 1, 1993. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 1994 are not presented because there are no pro forma
adjustments. Had the disposition of the Southern California residential
brokerage operations occurred on January 1, 1994, total revenues of $1,931,000
and total expenses of $1,931,000 included in the "Other, net" expense line would
not have been recognized. Also set forth below are unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 1994, which give
effect to the disposition as if the disposition had occurred September 30, 1994.

The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain
assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated statements of operations are not necessarily indicative
of the results of the Company's operations that would have actually occurred
had the disposition taken place on the dates assumed.

Grubb & Ellis Company and Subsidiaries
Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(a) Revenues -

The pro forma adjustment represents actual operating revenues for the
Southern California residential brokerage operations for 1993.

(b) Costs and Expenses -

Reflects actual operating expenses for 1993 including a minor amount of
associated corporate general and administrative expenses.

(c) Provision for Income Taxes -

Due to available operating loss carryforwards, the provision for income
taxes reflects only applicable state franchise taxes.

(d) Assets -

The Buyer reimbursed the Company approximately $79,000 for certain prepaid
expenses related primarily to brochures and advertising as of September 30,
1994. Prepaid and other current assets were also reduced by $228,000
relating primarily to the reclassification of items previously reserved for
at December 31, 1993.

Net real estate brokerage commissions receivable in the amount of $250,000
relate to commissions to be received from the Buyer for certain pending
real estate transactions and listings.

Net equipment and leasehold improvements in the amount of $227,000 were
transferred to the Buyer.

(e) Liabilities -

Accrued office and closure costs were reduced by $1,305,000 reflecting the
adjustment of reserve estimates established December 31, 1993 for the
closure and or sale of the Southern California residential offices. Such
adjustment reflects an amount that would have been recorded had the sale
been transacted on September 30, 1994. The remaining reserve relates to
the remaining net lease liability exposure of these residential offices and
other non-residential offices targeted for closure. Should the Buyer
perform under the remaining lease liability that it assumed and which
extends to November 1997, remaining reserves related to the residential
offices of approximately $850,000 will be reduced in future periods.

Grubb & Ellis Company and Subsidiaries
Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, (CONTINUED)

(e) Liabilities - (CONTINUED)

Other accrued expenses were adjusted by $79,000 representing the
elimination of deferred free rent on office space and certain other
liabilities as a result of the sale.

(f) Retained Earnings (Deficit) -

The reduction to retained deficit in the amount of $1,179,000 is the net
result of the gain on the disposition of the Southern California
residential brokerage operations and the adjustment of related assets and
liabilities as of September 30, 1994, not November 17, 1994, the date of
sale.
