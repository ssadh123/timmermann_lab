Item 5. Other Events

Class Action Lawsuit
On August 24, 1994, the plaintiffs in the case of Mark G. Epstein, et
al., v. Washington Energy Co., et al. filed a Notice of Appeal with the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

As previously reported in Registrants' Form 8-K, dated February 23,
1994, this class action lawsuit was filed against Washington Energy Company
and two of its officers in the United States District Court, Western District
of Washington, alleging violations of state and federal securities act
provisions and associated violations of Washington state law. The essence of
the complaint concerned alleged disclosure violations regarding the nature or
the extent of the downside financial risk associated with the 1992 utility
rate request filing of Washington Natural Gas Company ("Washington Natural"),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Washington Energy Company.

As previously reported in Registrant's Form 8-K, dated August 1, 1994,
on July 25, 1994, the District Court issued its Order Granting Defendants'
Motion to Dismiss and entered a judgment dismissing the action.

Anti-trust Lawsuit Filed Against Washington Natural
On September 6, 1994, Cost Management Services, Inc. ("Cost Manage
ment"), a Mercer Island, Washington based company involved in the purchase and
resale of natural gas, filed an action against Washington Natural in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In its
Complaint, Cost Management alleges that Washington Natural has monopolized or
attempted to monopolize the market for natural gas in the central Western
Washington area. Cost Management also alleges that Washington Natural failed
to charge its customers in accordance with the prices, terms and conditions
set forth in the tariffs filed by Washington Natural with the Washington
Utilities and Transportation Commission and that it wrongfully interfered with
Cost Management's relationships with its customers. Cost Management seeks
injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. Washington Natural
denies that it has monopolized or attempted to monopolize the relevant market
for natural gas, that it violated its tariffs, or that it in any way inter
fered with the relationships between Cost Management and its customers. 
Washington Natural intends to vigorously defend this matter.
