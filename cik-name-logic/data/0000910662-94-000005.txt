full faith and credit obligation by the United States of Amer-
ica, which, in either case, are not callable or redeemable at
the option of the issuer thereof, and shall also include a
depository receipt issued by a bank or trust company as custo-
dian with respect to any such obligation evidenced by such
depository receipt or a specific payment of interest on or
principal of any such obligation held by such custodian for the
account of the holder of a depository receipt; provided that
(except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to
make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of
such depository receipt from any amount received by the custo-
dian in respect of the obligation set forth in (i) or (ii)
above or the specific payment of interest on or principal of
such obligation evidenced by such depository receipt.

"Voting Stock" means Capital Stock of a corporation
of the class or classes having general voting power under ordi-
nary circumstances to elect at least a majority of the board of
directors, managers or trustees of such corporation (irrespec-
tive of whether or not at the time stock of any other class or
classes shall have or might have voting power upon the occur-
rence of any contingency).

SECTION 102. Compliance Certificates
and Opinions. 

Upon any application or request by the Company to the
Trustee to take any action under any provision of this Inden-
ture, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, pro-
vided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action
have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-12-

in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent,
if any, have been complied with, except that in the case of any
such application or request as to which the furnishing of such
documents is specifically required by any provision of this
Indenture relating to such particular application or request,
no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.

Every certificate or opinion with respect to compli-
ance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Inden-
ture (other than certificates provided pursuant to Subsection
704(4)) shall include:

(1) a statement that each individual signing such
certificate or opinion has read such condition or covenant
and the definitions herein relating thereto;

(2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of
the examination or investigation upon which the statements
or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are
based;

(3) a statement that, in the opinion of each such
individual, he has made such examination or investigation
as is necessary to enable him to express an informed opin-
ion as to whether or not such condition or covenant has
been complied with; and

(4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each
such individual, such condition or covenant has been com-
plied with.

SECTION 103. Form of Documents Delivered
to Trustee. 

In any case where several matters are required to be
certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Per-
son, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by,
or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that
they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some
matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters,
and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such
matters in one or several documents.

Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Com-
pany may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon
a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel,

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-13-

unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable
care should know, that the certificate or opinion or represen-
tations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate
or opinion is based are erroneous.

Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be
based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a cer-
tificate or opinion of, or representations by, an Authorized
Officer or Authorized Officers of the Company stating that the
information with respect to such factual matters is in the
possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the
exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate
or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are
erroneous.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute
two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates,
statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture,
they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one
instrument.

SECTION 104. Acts of Holders.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Inden-
ture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and
evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar
tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly
appointed in writing. If Securities of a series are issuable
as Bearer Securities, any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by
this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of such series
may, alternatively, be embodied in and evidenced by the record
of Holders of Securities of such series voting in favor
thereof, either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writ-
ing, at any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series
duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of
Article Thirteen, or a combination of such instruments and any
such record. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided,
such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments or record, or both, are delivered to the Trustee
and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company.
Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the
action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein some-
times referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such
instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting.
Proof of an execution of any such instrument or of a writing

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-14-

appointing any such agent or proxy, or of the holding by any
Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of
this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor
of the Trustee and the Company and any agent of the Company, if
made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any
meeting of Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner
provided in Section 1306.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person
of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affida-
vit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of any
notary public or other officer authorized by law to take
acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual sign-
ing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execu-
tion thereof. Where such execution is by an officer of a cor-
poration or association or a member of a partnership, or an
official of a public or governmental body, on behalf of such
corporation, association, partnership or public or governmental
body or by a fiduciary, such certificate or affidavit shall
also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact
and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same,
may also be proved in any other manner which shall be satisfac-
tory to the Trustee.

(c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Reg-
istered Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding
the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.

(d) The principal amount and serial numbers of
Bearer Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding
the same, may be proved by the production of such Bearer Secu-
rities or by a certificate executed, by any trust company,
bank, banker or other depositary, as depositary, wherever situ-
ated, if such certificate shall be satisfactory to the Trustee,
showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on
deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Bearer
Securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by
the certificate or affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer
Securities, if such certificate or affidavit shall be satisfac-
tory to the Trustee. The Trustee and the Company may assume
that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (1)
another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in
respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, or (2) such
Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Per-
son, or (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for
a Registered Security, or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-15-

Outstanding. The principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer
Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the
same, may also be proved in any other manner which shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any
Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security
and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration
of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof
in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Trus-
tee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation
of such action is made upon such Security.

SECTION 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee
and Company. 

Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document
provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given
or furnished to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company
shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made,
given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trus-
tee at its Corporate Trust Office, which, as of the date
of this Indenture, is: One First National Plaza, Suite
0126, Chicago, Illinois 60670-0126, Attention: Corpo-
rate Trust Administration; or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder
shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless
otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and
mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company
addressed to it at the address of its principal office
specified in the first paragraph of this instrument, to
the attention of the Corporate Secretary or at any other
address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by
the Company.

SECTION 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where
this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event,

(1) such notice shall be sufficiently given to
Holders of Registered Securities if in writing and

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-16-

mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of a
Registered Security affected by such event, at his
address as it appears in the Security Register, not later
than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest
date, prescribed for the giving of such notice;

(2) such notice shall be sufficiently given to
Holders of Bearer Securities if published in an autho-
rized Newspaper in the City of New York and in such other
city or cities as may be specified in such Securities on
a Business Day at least once, the first such publication
to be not earlier than the earliest date, and not later
than the latest date, prescribed for the giving of such
notice.

If, by reason of the suspension of regular mail ser-
vice, it shall be impracticable to mail notice of any event to
Holders of Registered Securities when such notice is required
to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then
such manner of giving such notice as shall be acceptable to the
Trustee shall constitute sufficient giving of such notice. In
any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is
given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any
defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a
Registered Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice
with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the
sufficiency of any notice with respect to Holders of Bearer
Securities given as provided herein.

If, by reason of the suspension of publication of any
Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of
any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice
to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such
notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given
in a manner satisfactory to the Trustee shall constitute suffi-
cient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Nei-
ther the failure to give notice by publication to Holders of
Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any
notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice
to Holders of Registered Securities given as provided herein.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any man-
ner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person enti-
tled to receive such notice, either before or after the event,
and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waiv-
ers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-17-

such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity
of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

SECTION 107. Language of Notices, Etc.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver, Act of Holders or other document
required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the Eng-
lish language, except that any published notice may be in an
official language of the country of publication.

SECTION 108. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or con-
flicts with any obligation or requirement included or deemed
included herein by operation of the Trust Indenture Act, such
obligation or requirement of the Trustee Indenture Act shall
control.

SECTION 109. Effect of Headings and
Table of Contents. 

The Article and Section headings herein and the Table
of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the
construction hereof.

SECTION 110. Successors and Assigns.

All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the
Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so
expressed or not.

SECTION 111. Separability Clause.

In case any provision in this Indenture or the Secu-
rities or coupons shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining pro-
visions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 112. Benefits of Indenture.

Nothing in this Indenture or the Securities or cou-
pons, expressed or implied, shall give to any Person, other
than the parties hereto, their successors hereunder and the
Holders of Securities or coupons, any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-18-

SECTION 113. Governing Law.

This Indenture and the Securities and any coupons
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts
of laws provisions thereof.

SECTION 114. Legal Holidays.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemp-
tion Date or Stated Maturity or Maturity of any Security shall
not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwith-
standing any other provision of this Indenture or of the Secu-
rities or coupons other than a provision in the Securities of
any series which specifically states that such provision shall
apply in lieu of this Section) payment of principal (and pre-
mium, if any) or interest, if any, need not be made at such
Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next suc-
ceeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same
force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or
Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity, pro-
vided that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable
for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date,
Redemption Date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may
be.

ARTICLE TWO

SECURITY FORMS

SECTION 201. Forms Generally.

The Registered Securities, if any, of each series and
the Bearer Securities, if any, of each series and related cou-
pons, if any, shall be in substantially the forms set forth in
Exhibit A and Exhibit B to this Indenture, respectively, or in
such other form (including temporary or permanent global form)
as shall be established in one or more supplemental indentures
or approved from time to time by or pursuant to a Board Resolu-
tion in accordance with Section 301, in each case with such
appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other
variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture and
may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification
and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be
required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or
as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers
executing such Securities and coupons, if any, as evidenced by

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-19-

their execution of the Securities and coupons, if any. If the
forms of Securities and coupons, if any, of any series (or the
form of any such temporary or permanent global Security) are
established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a
copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified
by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and
delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the
Company Order contemplated by Section 303 for the authentica-
tion and delivery of such Securities or coupons (or any such
temporary or permanent global Security).

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section
301 with respect to any series of Securities, the Securities of
each series shall be issuable in registered form without cou-
pons. If so provided as contemplated by Section 301, the Secu-
rities of a series also shall be issuable in bearer form, with
interest coupons, if any, attached.

The definitive Securities and coupons, if any, shall
be printed, lithographed or engraved or produced by any combi-
nation of these methods on steel engraved borders or may be
produced in any other manner permitted by the rules of any
securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, all
as determined by the officers executing such Securities and
coupons, if any, as evidenced by their execution of such Secu-
rities and coupons, if any.

SECTION 202. Form of Trustee's Certificate
of Authentication. 

The Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be
in substantially the following form:

SECTION 203. Securities in Global Form.

If Securities of a series are issuable in global
form, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, then, not-
withstanding clause (8) of Section 301 and the provisions of
Section 302, any such Security shall represent such of the Out-
standing Securities of such series as shall be specified
therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate
amount of Outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed
thereon and that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities
represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect
exchanges. Any endorsement of a Security in global form to
reflect the amount, or any decrease in the amount, of Outstand-
ing Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee
in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or
Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order
to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303 or Sec-
tion 304. Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if
applicable, Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and
redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner
and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified
therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order
pursuant to Section 303 or 304 has been, or simultaneously is,
delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to
endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global
form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102
and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 201 and
307, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301,
payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if
any, on any Security in permanent global form shall be made to
the Person or Persons specified therein.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 308 and
except as provided in the preceding paragraph, the Company, the
Trustee and any agent of the Company and the Trustee shall
treat a Person as the Holder of such principal amount of Out-
standing Securities represented by a permanent global Security
as shall be specified in a written statement of the Holder of
such permanent global Security or, in the case of a permanent
global Security in bearer form, of Euro-clear or CEDEL, S.A.,
which is produced to the Trustee by such Person.

except in the case of any series of Securities, as may other-
wise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution
referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set forth in
such Officers' Certificate or in any such indenture supplemen-
tal hereto. All Securities of one series need not be issued
at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may
be reopened for issuances of additional Securities of such

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-24-

series. Securities may differ between series in respect of
any matters.

If any of the terms of the Securities of any series
are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolu-
tion, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be
certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the deliv-
ery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of
the Securities of such series.

SECTION 302. Denominations.

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section

tered Securities of such series shall be issuable in denomina-
tions of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and any

denomination of $5,000.

SECTION 303. Execution, Authentication,
Delivery and Dating. 

The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the
Company by its Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer, any Senior Vice President, any Vice Presi-
dent or the Treasurer, under its corporate seal reproduced
thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Sec-
retaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Secu-
rities may be manual or facsimile. Coupons shall bear the
facsimile signature of the Treasurer or any Assistant Trea-
surer of the Company.

Securities and coupons bearing the manual or fac-
simile signatures of individuals who were at any time the
proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, not-
withstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased
to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery
of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of
such Securities.

At any time and from time to time after the execu-
tion and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver
Securities of any series, together with any coupons apper-
taining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for
authentication, together with a Company Order for the authen-
tication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-25-

accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and
deliver such Securities; provided, however, that, in connec-
tion with its original issuance, no Bearer Security shall be
mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United
States; and provided, further, that a Bearer Security may be
delivered in connection with its original issuance only if the
Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security shall have
furnished a certificate in the form set forth in Exhibit C-1
to this Indenture, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Bearer Security is delivered
and the date on which any temporary global Security first
becomes exchangeable for such Bearer Security in accordance
with the terms of such temporary global Security and this
Indenture. If any Security shall be represented by a perma-
nent global Bearer Security, then, for purposes of this Sec-
tion and Section 304, the notation of a beneficial owner's
interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or
upon exchange of a portion of a temporary global Security
shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with its original
issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent
global Security. Except as permitted by Section 306, the
Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security
unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured have
been detached and cancelled.

If the forms or terms of the Securities of the
series and any related coupons have been established in or
pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sec-
tions 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and
accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture
in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled
to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully pro-
tected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,

(a) if the forms of such Securities and any coupons
have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution
as permitted by Section 201, that such forms have been
established in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture;

(b) if the terms of such Securities and any coupons
have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution
as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been
established in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture; and

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-26-

(c) that such Securities, together with any coupons
appertaining thereto, when authenticated and delivered by
the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and
subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of
Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obliga-
tions of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their
terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insol-
vency, reorganization and other laws of general applica-
bility relating to or affecting the enforcement of credi-
tors' rights and to general principles of equity.

If such forms or terms have been so established, the Trustee
shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the
issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect
the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Secu-
rities and this Indenture or will otherwise affect the Trustee
in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of
the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not
to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary
to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursu-
ant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel
otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or
prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such
series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the
authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of
such series to be issued.

A Company Order delivered in the circumstances set
forth in the preceding paragraph may provide that Securities
which are the subject thereof will be authenticated and deliv-
ered by the Trustee on original issue from time to time upon
the telephonic or written order of persons designated in such
Company Order (telephonic instructions to be promptly confirmed
in writing by such persons) and that such persons are autho-
rized to determine, consistent with the Officers' Certificate
referred to in Section 301 or any applicable supplemental
indenture, such terms and conditions of said Securities as are
specified in such Company Order, provided the foregoing proce-
dure is acceptable to the Trustee.

Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of
its authentication. Each Bearer Security of a series shall be
dated as of the date of the initial issuance of Securities of
such series.

No Security or any related coupon shall be entitled
to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory
for any purpose unless there appears on such Security, or the
Security to which such coupon appertains, a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certifi-
cate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the
only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated
and delivered hereunder and that such Security and any related
coupon are entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

SECTION 304. Temporary Securities.

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of
any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities
which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or
otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substan-
tially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of
which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized, in
bearer form with one or more coupons or without coupons, and
with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
other variations as the officers executing such Securities may
determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
In the case of Debt Securities of any series, such temporary
Securities may be in global form, representing all or a portion
of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series. A temporary
Bearer Security shall be delivered only in compliance with the
conditions set forth in Section 303.

Except in the case of temporary Bearer Securities in
global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the
provisions of the following paragraphs), if temporary Securi-
ties of any series are issued, the Company will cause defini-
tive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreason-
able delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of
such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be
exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon sur-
render of the temporary Securities of such series at the office
or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 1002 in
a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the
Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any
unmatured coupons appertaining thereto) the Company shall exe-
cute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Secu-
rities of the same series and of like tenor of authorized

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-28-

denominations; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer
Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Regis-
tered Security; and provided, further, that a definitive Bearer
Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer
Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in
Section 303. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of
any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same bene-
fits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such
series.

If temporary Bearer Securities of any series are
issued in global form, any such temporary global Security
shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to the
London office of a depositary or common depositary (the "Common
Depositary"), for the benefit of Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A., for
credit to the respective accounts of the beneficial owners of
such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct).

Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later
than the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms
of, any such temporary global Bearer Security of a series (the
"Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee
definitive Securities of such series in aggregate principal
amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary global
Bearer Security, executed by the Company. On or after the
Exchange Date, such temporary global Bearer Security shall be
surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee, as the
Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or
from time to time in part, for definitive Securities of such
series without charge and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global
Bearer Security, a like aggregate principal amount of defini-
tive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations
and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary global
Bearer Security to be exchanged; provided, however, that,
unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Bearer
Security, upon such presentation by the Common Depositary, such
temporary global Bearer Security is accompanied by a certifi-
cate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by
Euro-clear as to the portion of such temporary global Bearer
Security held for its account then to be exchanged and a cer-
tificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and
signed by CEDEL S.A. as to the portion of such temporary global
Bearer Security held for its account then to be exchanged, each
in the form set forth in Exhibit C-2 to this Indenture. To the
extent required by applicable United States Treasury regula-
tions, in the case of a Bearer Security, the Exchange Date

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-29-

shall not be later than the expiration of a reasonable period
after the expiration of the 40-day period beginning on the date
of issuance of the temporary global Bearer Security to be
exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in
exchange for any such temporary global Bearer Security shall be
in bearer form, registered form, permanent global bearer form
or permanent global registered form, or any combination
thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, and, if
any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the
beneficial owner thereof; provided, however, that definitive
Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a portion
of a temporary global Security only in compliance with the
requirements of Section 303.

Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global
Bearer Security, the interest of a beneficial owner of Securi-
ties of a series in a temporary global Bearer Security shall be
exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of
like tenor following the Exchange Date when the account holder
instructs Euro-clear or CEDEL S.A., as the case may be, to
request such exchange on his behalf and delivers to Euro-clear
or CEDEL S.A., as the case may be, a certificate in the form
set forth in Exhibit C-1 to this Indenture, dated no earlier
than 15 days prior to the Exchange Date, copies of which cer-
tificate shall be available from the offices of Euro-clear and
CEDEL S.A., the Trustee and each Paying Agent. Unless other-
wise specified in such temporary global Bearer Security, any
such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial
owners of such temporary global Bearer Security, except that a
Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of
insurance, postage, transportation and the like in the event
that such Person does not take delivery of such definitive
Securities in person at the offices of Euro-clear or CEDEL S.A.
Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in
exchange for any portion of a temporary global Bearer Security
shall be delivered only outside the United States.

Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the
temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as defini-
tive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenti-
cated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on a
temporary global Bearer Security on an Interest Payment Date
for Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable
Exchange Date shall be payable to Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A. on
such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euro-clear and

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-30-

CEDEL S.A. to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates in
the form set forth in Exhibit C-3 to this Indenture, for credit
without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date
to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the benefi-
cial owners of such temporary global Security on such Interest
Payment Date and who have each delivered to Euro-clear or CEDEL
S.A., as the case may be, a certificate in the form set forth
in Exhibit C-4 to this Indenture. Any interest so received by
Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A. and not paid as herein provided shall
be returned to the Trustee immediately prior to the expiration
of two years after such Interest Payment Date in order to be
repaid to the Company in accordance with Section 1003.

SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of
Transfer and Exchange. 

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate
Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained
in such office and in any other office or agency to be main-
tained by the Company in accordance with Section 1002 being
herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Reg-
ister") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration
of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securi-
ties. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for
the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers
of Registered Securities as herein provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any
Registered Security of any series at the office or agency main-
tained pursuant to Section 1002 for such purpose in a Place of
Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the des-
ignated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered
Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations
and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.

At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of
any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of
the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like
aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the
Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Bearer
Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered
Securities.

At the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any
series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-31-

series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Bearer Secu-
rities to be exchanged at any such office or agency, with all
unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default apper-
taining thereto. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable
to produce any such unmatured or matured coupon or coupons in
default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities
are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company
in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or
coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may
be waived by the Company or jointly by the Company and the
Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indem-
nity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying
Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security
shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in
respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such
Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment;
provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Sec-
tion 1002, interest represented by coupons shall be payable
only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons at an
office or agency located outside the United States. Notwith-
standing the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series
is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a
Registered Security of the same series and like tenor after the
close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular
Record Date and before the opening of business at such office
or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any
Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such
office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of
Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered
without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or
proposed date for payment, as the case may be, and interest or
Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on
such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the
case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in
exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to
the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the pro-
visions of this Indenture.

Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for
exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder mak-
ing the exchange is entitled to receive.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301, any permanent global
Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-32-

paragraph. If the beneficial owners of interests in a perma-
nent global Security are entitled to exchange such interests
for Securities of such series and of like tenor and principal
amount of another authorized form and denomination, as speci-
fied as contemplated by Section 301, then without unnecessary
delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on
which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall
deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities of that series in
aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of
such permanent global Security, executed by the Company. On or
after the earliest date on which such interests may be so
exchanged, such permanent global Security shall be surrendered
by the Common Depositary or such other depositary as shall be
specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the
Trustee as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be
exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for defini-
tive Securities of the same series without charge and the Trus-
tee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each por-
tion of such permanent global Security, a like aggregate prin-
cipal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of
authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of
such permanent global Security to be exchanged which, unless
the Securities of the series are not issuable both as Bearer
Securities and as Registered Securities, as specified as con-
templated by Section 301, shall be in the form of Bearer Secu-
rities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as
shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; provided,
however, that no such exchanges may occur during a period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selec-
tion of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending on
the relevant Redemption Date; and provided, further, that no
Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a perma-
nent global Security (or, if specified as contemplated by
Section 301, in exchange for Registered Securities) shall be
mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United
States. Promptly following any such exchange in part and any
endorsement thereon to reflect the amount represented by such
exchange, such permanent global Security shall be returned by
the Trustee to the Common Depositary or such other depositary
or Common Depositary referred to above in accordance with the
instructions of the Company referred to above. If a Registered
Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a permanent
global Security after the close of business at the office or
agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record
Date and before the opening of business at such office or
agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Spe-
cial Record Date and before the opening of business at such

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-33-

office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of
Defaulted Interest, interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case
may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or
proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such
Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment
Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to
the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such
permanent global Security is payable in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture.

All Securities issued upon any registration of trans-
fer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of
the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Registered Security presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so
required by the Company or the Trustee or any transfer agent)
be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and
the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed, by
the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration
of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than
exchanges pursuant to Sections 304, 906 or 1107 not involving
any transfer.

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, reg-
ister the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series dur-
ing a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days
before any selection of Securities of that series to be
redeemed and ending at the close of business on (A) if Securi-
ties of the series are issuable only as Registered Securities,
the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption,
and (B) if Securities of the series are issuable as Bearer
Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant
notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also
issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication,
the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, (ii) to reg-
ister the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so
selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-34-

(iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemp-
tion except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a
Registered Security of that series and like tenor, provided
that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surren-
dered for redemption.

Nothwithstanding anything in this Indenture or in the
terms of a Security to the contrary, the exchange of Bearer
Securities for Registered Securities will be subject to satis-
faction of the provisions of the United States tax laws in
effect at the time of the exchange. Neither the Company nor
the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall
be required to exchange any Bearer Security for a Registered
Security if (i) as a result thereof and in the Company's judg-
ment, the Company would incur adverse consequences under then
applicable United States Federal income tax laws and (ii) in
the case of the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the
Trustee, the Company shall have delivered to such Person an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as to the mat-
ters set forth in clause (i) above.

SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and
Stolen Securities. 

If any mutilated Security or a Security with a muti-
lated coupon appertaining thereto is surrendered to the Trus-
tee, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenti-
cate and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Security of the
same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing
a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corre-
sponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to the surren-
dered Security.

If there shall have been delivered to the Company and
the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruc-
tion, loss or theft of any Security or coupon, and (ii) such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each
of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company
or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired
by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon
its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu
of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange
for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon
appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not destroyed, lost or
stolen), a new Security of the same series and of like tenor
and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously
outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any,

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-35-

appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to
the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon
appertains.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and
payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing
a new Security, pay such Security or coupon; provided, however,
that principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any,
on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in
Section 1002, be payable only at an office or agency located
outside the United States; and provided, further, that, unless
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect
to any series of Securities, interest on Bearer Securities (but
not any additional amounts payable as provided in Section
1008), shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of
the coupons appertaining thereto.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Sec-
tion, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

Every new Security of any series with its coupons, if
any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed,
lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which
a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute
an original additional contractual obligation of the Company,
whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its
coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall
be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Security
and coupons, if any, shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all
other Securities of that series and their coupons, if any, duly
issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and
shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and
remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of muti-
lated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.

SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest
Rights Preserved. 

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section
301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any
Registered Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or
duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid
to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business
on the Regular Record Date for such interest.

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section
301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest due
on Bearer Securities on or before the Maturity shall be payable
only upon presentation and surrender of the several coupons for
such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they
severally mature.

Any interest on any Registered Security of any series
which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided
for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Default
Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on
the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such
Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company,
at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2)
below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any
Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Reg-
istered Securities of such series (or their respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following
manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing
of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on
each Registered Security of such series and the date of
the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company
shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to
the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of
such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satis-
factory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date
of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be
held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to
such Defaulted Interest as provided in this clause.
Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for
the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not
more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the
date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days
after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the pro-
posed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Com-
pany of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-37-

the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Spe-
cial Record Date therefor (i) to be mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities
of such series at his address as it appears in the Secu-
rity Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special
Record Date, and (ii) with respect to Bearer Securities of
such series, to be published as provided for in Section
106. The Trustee may, in addition, in its discretion, in
the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a simi-
lar notice to be published at least once in a newspaper
published in the English language customarily published on
each Business Day and of general circulation in the Bor-
ough of Manhattan, the City of New York, New York, but
such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the
establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Spe-
cial Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid,
such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in
whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or
their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at
the close of business on such Special Record Date and
shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following
clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted
Interest on the Registered Securities of any series in any
other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements
of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be
listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such
exchange, if, after notice is given by the Company to the
Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause,
such manner or payment shall be deemed practicable by the
Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section
and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture
upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu
of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest
accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such
other Security.

SECTION 308. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for
registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any
agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in
whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner
of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving pay-
ment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Sec-
tions 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such Security and for
all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not payment on such
Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor
any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons apper-
taining thereto shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trus-
tee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the
bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any coupon as
the absolute owner of such Bearer Security or coupon for the
purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and
for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not payment on
such Bearer Security or coupon is overdue, and neither the Com-
pany, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee
shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 309. Cancellation.

All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment,
redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit
against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any
Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and
such Securities and coupons shall be promptly cancelled by the
Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee
for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be
promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities can-
celled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permit-
ted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and coupons
held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by the Trustee unless
other instructions are furnished to the Trustee by a Company
Order.

SECTION 310. Computation of Interest.

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by
Section 301 for the Securities of any series, interest, if any,
on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

ARTICLE FOUR

SECTION 401. Satisfaction and Discharge
of Indenture.

or exchange of Securities of such series herein expressly pro-
vided for or in the form of Security for such series and any
right to receive additional amounts, as provided in
Section 1008), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company,
shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture as to such series, when

one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trus-
tee for the giving of notice of redemption by the

Company,

and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above,
has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee
as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount suffi-
cient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such
Securities and coupons not theretofore delivered to the

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that, with respect to such series, all conditions
precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction
and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of

the Company to the Trustee with respect to such series under
Section 607, and, if money shall have been deposited with the
Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Sec-
tion, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the
last paragraph of Section 1003, shall survive.

ited with the Trustee (or a successor trustee satisfying the
requirements of Section 609) pursuant to Section 403 and all
money received by the Trustee in respect of U.S. Government
Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 403
shall be held in trust and shall be applied by it, in accor-
dance with the provisions of the series of Securities and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Pay-
ing Agent as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled
thereto, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect
of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any,
on the Securities for which payment of such money has been

SECTION 403. Discharge and Defeasance of
Securities of any Series. 

If this Section 403 is specified, as contemplated by
Section 301, to be applicable to the Securities of any series,
then, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 401, the Com-
pany shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire
indebtedness on all the Outstanding Securities of any such
series on the 91st day after the date of the deposit referred
to in subparagraph (d) hereof, and the provisions of this
Indenture, as it relates to such Outstanding Securities, shall
no longer be in effect (and the Trustee, at the expense of the
Company, shall, upon Company Request execute proper instruments
acknowledging the same), except as to:

(a) the rights of Holders of Securities of such
series to receive, from the trust funds described in
subparagraph (d) hereof, (i) payment of the principal of
(and premium, if any) and each installment of principal of
(and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Out-
standing Securities of such series on the Stated Maturity
of such principal or installment of principal or interest

fied, as contemplated by Section 301, to be applicable to
the Securities of any series, the Company's obligations
with respect to the Securities of such series under
Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003; or, alternatively,
(2) if this Section 403(c)(2) is specified, as contem-
plated by Section 301, to be applicable to the Securities
of any series, the Company's obligations with respect to
such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1001, 1002
and 1003;

provided that, the following conditions shall have been
satisfied:

(d) the Company shall have irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited (in accordance with Section 402)
with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the
requirements of Section 609) as trust funds in trust spe-
cifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely
to, the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of that
series, with reference to this Section 403 (i) money in an
amount, or (ii) U.S. Government Obligations which through
the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof
in accordance with their terms will provide not later than
one Business Day before the due date of any payment
referred to in clause (A) or (B) of this subparagraph (d)
money in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof, suffi-
cient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accounts expressed in a writ-
ten certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay
and discharge (A) the principal of (and premium, if any)
and each installment of principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest, if any, on the Outstanding Securities of
such series on the Stated Maturity of such principal or
installment of principal or interest or on the applicable
Redemption Date and (B) any mandatory sinking fund pay-
ments or analogous payments applicable to the Securities
of such series on the day on which such payments are due
and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture
and of such Securities;

(e) such deposit shall not cause the Trustee with
respect to the Securities of such series to have a con-
flicting interest as defined in Section 608 or for pur-
poses of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to the Secu-
rities of any series;

(f) such deposit will not result in a breach or vio-
lation of, or constitute a default under, any applicable
laws, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument
to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound;
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-43-

(g) if this Section 403(g) is specified, as contem-
plated by Section 301, to be applicable to the Securities
of any series, such provision would not cause any Out-
standing Securities of such series then listed on the New
York Stock Exchange or other nationally recognized securi-
ties exchange to be de-listed as a result thereof;

(h) no Event of Default or event which with the giv-
ing of notice or lapse of time or both would become an
Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that
series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date
of such deposit or at any time during the period ending on
the 91st day after such date;

(i) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, based upon appli-
cable Federal income tax law or a ruling published by the
Internal Revenue Service (which opinion, for the purposes
contemplated by Section 403(c)(1), must be based on a
change in applicable Federal income tax law after the date
of this Indenture or a ruling published by the Internal
Revenue Service after the date of this Indenture), the
Holders of the Securities of such series will not recog-
nize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge and
will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount
and in the same manner and at the same times, as would
have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and dis-
charge had not occurred; and

(j) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the
defeasance contemplated by this Section have been complied
with.

REMEDIES

SECTION 501. Events of Default.

"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect
to Securities of any series, means any one of the following
events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and
whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by
operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order
of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any adminis-
trative or governmental body):

(1) default in the payment of any installment of
interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes
due and payable, and continuance of such default for a
period of 30 days; or

(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or
premium, if any, on) any Security of that series at its
Maturity; or

(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund pay-
ment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that
series; or

(4) default in the performance or breach of any
covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture
(other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose per-
formance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section spe-
cifically dealt with or which has expressly been included
in this Indenture solely for the benefit of a particular
series of Securities other than that series) and continu-
ance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days
after there has been given, by registered or certified
mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and
the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a
written notice specifying such default or breach and
requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice
is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or 

(5) the entry by a court of competent jurisdiction
of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Com-
pany in an involuntary case under any applicable bank-
ruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law
now or hereafter in effect, or (B) a decree or order
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian,
trustee, sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company
or for any substantial part of its property, or ordering
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-45-

the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs and such
decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a
period of 60 consecutive days; or

(6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary
case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorgan-
ization or other similar law now or hereafter in effect,
or the consent by it to the entry of an order for relief
in an involuntary case in respect of it under any such
law, or the consent by it to the appointment of or taking
possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,
custodian, sequestrator (or similar official) of the Com-
pany or for any substantial part of its property, or the
making by it of any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors; or

(7) any other Event of Default provided with respect
to Securities of that series.

SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity;
Rescission and Annulment.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing,
then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less
than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the Secu-
rities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities,
such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may
be specified in the terms thereof) of all of the Securities of
that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in
writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Hold-
ers), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or
specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration
with respect to Securities of any series has been made and
before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has
been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article
provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the
Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration
and its consequences if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trus-
tee a sum sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue installments of interest on all
Securities of that series,

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-46-

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on)
any Securities of that series which have become due other-
wise than by such declaration of acceleration and
interest, if any, thereon at the rate or rates prescribed
therefor in such Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest
is lawful, interest upon any overdue installments of
interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such
Securities, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee
hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, dis-
bursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities
of that series, other than the nonpayment of the principal
of Securities of that series which have become due solely
by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or
waived as provided in Section 513.

No such recision shall affect any subsequent default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and
Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.

The Company covenants that if

(1) default is made in the payment of any install-
ment of interest on any Security when such interest
becomes due and payable and such default continues for a
period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal
of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at its Maturity,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for
the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and coupons, the
whole amount then due and payable on such Securities and cou-
pons for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any,
and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be
legally enforceable, interest on the overdue principal (and
premium, if any) and on any overdue installments of interest,
at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities
and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be suf-
ficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection,

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-47-

including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith
upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee
of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for
the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute
such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the
same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securi-
ties and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable
in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Com-
pany or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever
situated.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the
rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any
related coupons by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the
Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any
such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any cove-
nant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise
of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper
remedy.

SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

In the case of the pendency of any receivership,
insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrange-
ment, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding rel-
ative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities
or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or the
creditors of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee
(irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall
then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration
or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have
made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue prin-
cipal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by inter-
vention in such proceeding or otherwise,

(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount
of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any,
owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file
such other papers or documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee
(including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-48-

agents and counsel) and of the Holders of Securities and
coupons allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other prop-
erty payable or deliverable on any such claims and to dis-
tribute the same;

and any receiver, assignee, custodian, trustee, liquidator,
sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities
and coupons to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the
event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such pay-
ments directly to the Holders of Securities and coupons, to pay
to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compen-
sation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee
under Section 607.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reor-
ganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting
the Securities or coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof
or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of
any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such proceeding.

SECTION 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims
Without Possession of
Securities or Coupons. 

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture
or the Securities or coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by
the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or
coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating
thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee
shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express
trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for
the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disburse-
ments and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be
for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities and
coupons in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-49-

SECTION 506. Application of Money Collected.

Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this
Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or
dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of
such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or
interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities or cou-
pons or both and the notation thereon of the payment if only
partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee
under Section 607;

Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and
unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and inter-
est, if any, on the Securities and coupons in respect of
which or for the benefit of which such money has been col-
lected, ratably, without preference or priority of any
kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such
Securities and coupons for principal (and premium, if any)
and interest, if any, respectively; and

Third: The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons
determined to be entitled thereto.

SECTION 507. Limitation on Suits.

No Holder of any Security of any series or any
related coupons shall have any right to institute any proceed-
ing, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or
for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other
remedy hereunder, unless

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice
to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with
respect to the Securities of that series;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall
have made written request to the Trustee to institute pro-
ceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own
name as Trustee hereunder;

(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trus-
tee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and
liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such
request;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of
such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to
institute any such proceeding; and
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-50-

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written
request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day
period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of the
Holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in
any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provi-
sion of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the
rights of any other such Holders of, or to obtain or to seek to
obtain priority or preference over any other such Holders or to
enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner
herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all
such Holders.

SECTION 508. Unconditional Rights of Holders
To Receive Principal, Premium
and Interest. 

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Inden-
ture, the Holder of any Security or coupon shall have the
right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment
of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to
Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such Security or
payment of such coupon on the Stated Maturity or Maturities
expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of
redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for
the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not
be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

If the Trustee or any Holder of any Security or cou-
pon has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or rem-
edy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discon-
tinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined
adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every
such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of such
Securities and coupons shall, subject to any determination in
such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to
their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and
remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as
though no such proceeding had been instituted.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-51-

SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Securities or coupons in the last paragraph of Section 306, no
right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trus-
tee or to the Holders of Securities or coupons is intended to
be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and
in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.
The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder,
or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder
of any Security or coupon to exercise any right or remedy
accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right
or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default
or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by
this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders of
Securities or coupons may be exercised from time to time, as
often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the
Holders of Securities or coupons, as the case may be.

SECTION 512. Control by Holders.

(a) The Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right
to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceed-
ing for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any
trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the
Securities of such series, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict
with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and

(2) the Trustee may take any other action
deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent
with such direction.

(b) The Company may set a record date for purposes
of determining the identity of Holders entitled to vote or con-
sent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted
by this Section 512 and Section 513. Such record date shall be

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-52-

the later of (1) 30 days prior to the first solicitation of
such consent or (2) the date of the most recent list of Holders
furnished to the Trustee pursuant to Section 701 prior to such
solicitation.

SECTION 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on
behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series and
any related coupons waive any past default hereunder with
respect to the Securities of such series and its consequences,
except a default

(1) in the payment of the principal of (or pre-
mium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Securities of
such series, or

(2) with respect to a covenant or provision
hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of the Holder of each Out-
standing Security of such series affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to
exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be
deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture;
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs.

All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder
of any Security or coupon by his acceptance thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion
require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for
any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the
filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to
pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its dis-
cretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attor-
neys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due
regard for the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses
made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section
shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any
suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in
the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Out-
standing Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-53-

any Holder of any Security or coupon for the enforcement of the
payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest,
if any, on any Security or the payment of any coupon on or
after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Secu-
rity or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the
Redemption Date).

SECTION 515. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may law-
fully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or
plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now
or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the cove-
nants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to
the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives
all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it
will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power
herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the
execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.

ARTICLE SIX

THE TRUSTEE

SECTION 601. Certain Duties and
Responsibilities. 

(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of
Default with respect to the Securities of any series,

(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such
duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth
in this Indenture with respect to such series, and no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Indenture against the Trustee; and

(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part,
the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the
statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the
Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Inden-
ture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions
which by any provisions hereof are specifically required
to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-54-

a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not
they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

(b) In case an Event of Default has occurred with
respect to Securities of any series and is continuing, the
Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in
it by this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities,
and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as
a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of his own affairs.

(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be con-
strued to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negli-
gent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own will-
ful misconduct, except that

(1) this Subsection shall not be construed to
limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any
error or judgment made in good faith by a Responsible
Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was
negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with
respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction
of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of any series, determined as pro-
vided in Section 512, relating to the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy avail-
able to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power con-
ferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect
to the Securities of such series; and

(4) no provision of this Indenture shall
require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance
of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any
of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable
grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or ade-
quate indemnity against such risk or liability is not rea-
sonably assured to it.

(d) Whether or not herein expressly so provided,
every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-55-

affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trus-
tee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

SECTION 602. Notice of Defaults.

Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default
hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the
Trustee shall transmit in the manner and to the extent provided
in Section 703(c), notice of such default hereunder known to
the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or
waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a
default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any)
or interest, if any, on any Security of such series or in the
payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to Securi-
ties of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in with-
holding such notice if and so long as the board of directors,
the executive committee or a trust committee of directors
and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith deter-
mines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of
the Holders of Securities of such series, and provided, fur-
ther, that in the case of any default of the character speci-
fied in Section 501(4) with respect to Securities of such
series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least

(c) whenever in the administration of this Indenture
the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be
proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omit-
ting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evi-
dence be herein specifically presented) may, in the
absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers'
Certificate and such Officers' Certificate, in the absence

suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this
Indenture upon the faith thereof;

written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel
shall be full and complete authorization and protection in

hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Hold-
ers pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders of
Securities of any series or related coupons shall have
offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be
incurred by it in compliance with such request or
direction;

(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any
investigation into the facts or matters stated in any res-
olution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
debenture, note, coupon, other evidence of indebtedness or
other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discre-
tion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into
such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trus-
tee shall determine to make such further inquiry or inves-
tigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books,
records and premises of the Company, personally or by
agent or attorney; and 

(g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or
powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either

SECTION 604. Not Responsible for Recitals or
Issuance of Securities. 

The recitals contained herein and in the Securities,
except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be
taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes
no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no
representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this
Indenture or of the Securities or the coupons. The Trustee
shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Com-
pany of Securities or the proceeds thereof.

SECTION 605. May Hold Securities.

The Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar
or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any
other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities
or coupons and, subject to Section 608 and 613, may otherwise
deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such
other agent.

SECTION 606. Money Held in Trust.

Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not
be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by
law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on
any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed
with the Company.

SECTION 607. Compensation and Reimbursement.

The Company agrees:

(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time
reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it
hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trus-
tee of an express trust);

(2) except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred
or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of
this Indenture (including (i) the reasonable compensation
and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and coun-
sel and (ii) any taxes and related costs incurred in

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-58-

connection with an irrevocable deposit made by the Company
pursuant to Section 403(d)), except any such expense, dis-
bursement or advance as may be attributable to its negli-
gence or bad faith; and

(3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold
it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense
incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including
the costs and expenses of defending itself against any
claim or liability in connection with the exercise or per-
formance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

The obligations of the Company under this Section
shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall
survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. Such
additional indebtedness shall be a senior claim to that of the
Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the
Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of
the Holders of particular Securities, and the Securities are
hereby subordinated to such senior claim. If the Trustee
incurs expenses after the occurrence of a default specified in
Section 501(5) and 501(6), such expenses are intended to con-
stitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.

SECTION 608. Disqualification; Conflicting
Interests. 

If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting
interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the
Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the
extent and in the manner provided by and subject to the provi-
sions of, the Trust Indenture Act.

SECTION 609. Corporate Trustee Required;
Eligibility. 

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which
shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the
laws of the United States or of any State or the District of
Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000, subject to supervision or examination by Federal,
State or District of Columbia authority and having a Corporate
Trust Office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of
New York, New York. If such corporation publishes reports of

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-59-

condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the require-
ments of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then
for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and sur-
plus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined
capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease
to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Sec-
tion, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect hereinafter specified in this Article. Neither the Com-
pany nor any Affiliate of the Company may serve as Trustee.

SECTION 610. Resignation and Removal;
Appointment of a Successor.

(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no
appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article
shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee under Section 611.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect
to the Securities of one or more series by giving written
notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance
by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have
been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving
of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may peti-
tion any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series.

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with
respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of such series delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.

(d) If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Sec-
tion 608 after written request therefor by the Company or
by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Secu-
rity for at least six months; or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible
under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written
request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder; or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of act-
ing or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-60-

receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be
appointed or any public officer shall take charge or con-
trol of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the
purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by Board Resolution may
remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) sub-
ject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder
of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself
and all other similarly situated, petition any court of compe-
tent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect
to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or
Trustees.

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or
become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the
office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities
of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution,
shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with
respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being
understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed
with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such
series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee
with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and
shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611.
If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapa-
bility, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed
by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company
and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed
shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611,
become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee
appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect
to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by
the Company or the Holders of Securities of that series and
accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any
Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Secu-
rity of such series for at least six months, subject to Section
514, may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situ-
ated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securi-
ties of such series.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-61-

(f) The Company shall give notice of each resigna-
tion and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Secu-
rities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trus-
tee with respect to the Securities of any series in the manner
provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of
the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

(g) Except in the case of a default in the payment
of the principal of or interest on any Security or in the pay-
ment of any sinking or purchase fund installment, the Trustee
shall not be required to resign as provided by this Section if
such Trustee shall have sustained the burden of proving, on
application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing
thereon, that

(1) the default under the Indenture may be
cured or waived during a reasonable period and under
the procedures described in such application, and

(2) a stay of the Trustee's duty to resign will
not be inconsistent with the interest of Holders.
The filing of an application shall automatically stay
the performance of the duty to resign until the Com-
mission orders otherwise.

SECTION 611. Acceptance of Appointment
by Successor. 

(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a suc-
cessor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such suc-
cessor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instru-
ment accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation
or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and
such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or con-
veyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers,
trusts, and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of
the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee
shall, upon payment of the charges due it pursuant to Section
607, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the
retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver
to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such
retiring Trustee hereunder. Upon request of any such successor
Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-62-

more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such suc-
cessor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts.

(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a suc-
cessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more
(but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and
each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or
more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental
hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such
appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as
shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and
to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of
such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is
not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such
provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring
Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series
as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue
to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or
change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be nec-
essary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the
trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood
that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall
constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that
each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereun-
der separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder
administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution
and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the
extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, with-
out any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested
with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring
Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series
to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates;
but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such
retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to
such successor Trustee all property and money held by such
retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of
that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the
Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully
and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor

Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in para-
graph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appoint-
ment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trus-
tee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.

SECTION 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation
or Succession to Business. 

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged
or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any cor-
poration resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation
to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation suc-
ceeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee
hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise quali-
fied and eligible under this Article, without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of
the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in
office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to
such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and
deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as
if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such
Securities.

SECTION 613. Preferential Collection of Claims
Against Company.

The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of Sec-
tion 311 of the Trust Indenture Act.

HOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS BY TRUSTEE AND COMPANY

SECTION 701. Company To Furnish Trustee Names
and Addresses of Holders of
Registered Securities.

The Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
the Trustee with respect to the Registered Securities of each
series:

(a) semi-annually, not more than 15 days after each
Regular Record Date, or in the case of any series of Secu-
rities on which semi-annual interest is not payable, not
more than 15 days after such semi-annual dates as may be
specified by the Trustee, a list, in such form as the
Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses
of the Holders of such Registered Securities as of such
Regular Record Date or such semi-annual date, as the case
may be, and 

(b) at such other times as the Trustee may request
in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Com-
pany of any such request, a list of similar form and con-
tent as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time
such list is furnished,

provided, however, that so long as the Trustee is the Security
Registrar, no such list need be furnished.

SECTION 702. Preservation of Information;
Communications to Holders.

(a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form
as is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Hold-
ers of Registered Securities (i) contained in the most recent
list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 701, (ii)
received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar
(or Paying Agent, if so acting) and (iii) filed with it during
the two preceding years pursuant to Section 703(c)(2). The
Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in
Section 701 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.

(b) If three or more Holders of Securities of any
series (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writ-
ing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof
that each such applicant has owned a Security for a period of
at least six months preceding the date of such application, and
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-65-

such application states that the applicants desire to communi-
cate with other Holders of Securities of such series with
respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Secu-
rities of such series and is accompanied by a copy of the form
of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose
to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five business days
after the receipt of such application, at its election, either

(i) afford such applicants access to the information
preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with
Section 702(a), or 

(ii) inform such applicants as to the approximate
number of Holders of Registered Securities of such series
whose names and addresses appear in the information pre-
served at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Sec-
tion 702(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to
such Holders of Registered Securities of such series the
form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in
such application.

If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such appli-
cants access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the
written request of such applicants, mail to each Holder of Reg-
istered Securities of such series whose name and address
appears in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee
in accordance with Section 702(a), a copy of the form of proxy
or other communication which is specified in such request, with
reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the
material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the pay-
ment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five
days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such appli-
cants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the
material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that,
in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary
to the best interest of the Holders of Registered Securities of
such series or would be in violation of applicable law. Such
written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If
the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objec-
tions specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter
an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if,
after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such
objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and oppor-
tunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have
been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee
shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders of Reg-
istered Securities of such series with reasonable promptness
after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender;
otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any objection or
duty to such applicants respecting their application.

(c) Every Holder of Securities or coupons, by
receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the
Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee, nor any agent
of the Company or the Trustee shall be held accountable by
reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the
names and addresses of the Holders of Registered Securities in
accordance with Section 702(b), regardless of the source from
which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall
not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pur-
suant to a request made under Section 702(b).

COVENANTS

SECTION 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium
and Interest. 

The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of
each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay
the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on
the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of
such series of Securities, any coupons appertaining thereto and
this Indenture. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by
Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any
interest due on Bearer Securities on or before Maturity shall
be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several
coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby
as they severally mature.

SECTION 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

If Securities of a series are issuable as or
exchangeable for Registered Securities, the Company will main-
tain in each Place of Payment for such series an office or
agency where Securities of that series may be presented or sur-
rendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Company with respect to the
Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served, any
one or more of which offices or agencies may be the same for
one or more series of Securities.

If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer
Securities, the Company will maintain (A) in the Borough of
Manhattan, the City of New York, an office or agency where any
Registered Securities of that series may be presented or sur-
rendered for payment, where any Registered Securities of that
series may be surrendered for registration of transfer, where
Securities of that series may be surrendered for exchange,
where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of
the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served
and where Bearer Securities of that series and related coupons
may be presented or surrendered for payment in the circum-
stances described in the following paragraph (and not other-
wise), (B) subject to any laws or regulations applicable
thereto, in a Place of Payment for that series which is located
outside the United States, an office or agency where Bearer

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-76-

Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented
and surrendered for payment (including payment of any addi-
tional amounts payable on Securities of that series pursuant to
Section 1008); provided, however, that if the Securities of
that series are listed on The International Stock Exchange of
the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange located
outside the United States and such securities exchange shall so
require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Secu-
rities of that series in London, Luxembourg or any other
required city located outside the United States, as the case
may be, so long as the Securities of that series are listed on
such exchange, and (C) subject to any laws or regulations
applicable thereto, in a Place of Payment for that series
located outside the United States, an office or agency where
any Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for
registration of transfer, where Securities of that series may
be surrendered for exchange and where notices and demands to or
upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series
and this Indenture may be served.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the
Trustee and prompt notice to the Holders of Securities of such
series, as provided in Section 106, of the location, and of any
change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at
any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required
office or agency in respect of any series of Securities or
shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof,
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made
or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, except
that Bearer Securities of that series and the related coupons
may be presented and surrendered for payment (including payment
of any additional amounts payable on Bearer Securities of that
series pursuant to Section 1008) at any Place of Payment for
such series located outside the United States and the Company
hereby appoints the Trustee its agent to receive all such pre-
sentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

No payment of principal, premium or interest on
Bearer Securities shall be made at any office or agency of the
Company in the United States or by check mailed to any address
in the Untied States or by transfer to an account maintained
with a bank located in the United States; provided, however,
that, if the Securities of a series are denominated and payable
in Dollars, payment of principal of and any premium and inter-
est on any Bearer Security (including any additional amounts
payable on Securities of such series pursuant to Section 1008)

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-77-

and payment of any coupon related thereto shall be made at the
office of the Company's Paying Agent in the United States, if
(but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such
principal, premium, interest or additional amounts, as the case
may be, at all offices or agencies outside the United States
maintained for the purpose by the Company in accordance with
this Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange
controls or other similar restrictions.

The Company may also from time to time designate one
or more other offices or agencies (in or outside any Place of
Payment) where the Securities of one or more series and any
related coupons may be presented or surrendered for any or all
such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designa-
tions; provided, however, that no such designation or rescis-
sion shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation
to maintain an office or agency for Securities of any series
and related coupons for such purposes. The Company will give
prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or
rescission and of any change in the location of any such other
office or agency.

SECTION 1003. Money for Security Payments
To Be Held in Trust. 

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Pay-
ing Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on
or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if
any) or interest, if any, on any of the Securities of that
series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Per-
sons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal
(and premium, if any) or interest, if any, so becoming due
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise dis-
posed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trus-
tee of its action or failure so to act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying
Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due
date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if
any, on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying
Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if
any) or interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held
in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such prin-
cipal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is
the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of
its action or failure so to act.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-78-

The Company will cause each Paying Agent of any
series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and
deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent
shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this
Section, that such Paying Agent will:

(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on
the Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of
the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Persons otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the
Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that
series) in the making of any payment of principal (and
premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of
that series; and

(3) at any time during the continuance of any such
default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forth-
with pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such
Paying Agent.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of
obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or
for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Pay-
ing Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the
Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trus-
tee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were
held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such pay-
ment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent
shall be released from all further liability with respect to
such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying
Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of
the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on
any Security of any series or the payment of any related coupon
and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and
premium, if any) or interest, if any, has become due and pay-
able shall, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions
of applicable escheat, or abandoned or unclaimed property law,
be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by
the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the
Holder of such Security or any coupon appertaining thereto
shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only
to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-79-

Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money,
and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall
thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment,
may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once,
in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment, notice
that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date speci-
fied therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the
date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money
then remaining will, unless otherwise required by mandatory
provisions of applicable escheat, or abandoned or unclaimed
property law, be repaid to the Company.

SECTION 1004. Restrictions on Secured Debt.

The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of
each series of Securities, other than any series established by
or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more supplemen-
tal indentures hereto which specifically provides otherwise,
that it will not itself, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, incur, issue, assume, or guarantee any loans,
whether or not evidenced by negotiable instruments or securi-
ties, or any notes, bonds, debentures or other similar evi-
dences of indebtedness for money borrowed (loans, and notes,
bonds, debentures or other similar evidences of indebtedness
for money borrowed being hereinafter called "Debt"), secured
after the date hereof by a pledge of, or mortgage or lien on,
any Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsid-
iary or any shares of Capital Stock of or Debt of any
Restricted Subsidiary (mortgages, pledges and liens being here-
inafter called "Mortgage" or "Mortgages"), without effectively
providing that the Securities, other than Securities of a
series not entitled to the benefits of this covenant, shall be
secured equally and ratably with (or, at the option of the Com-
pany, prior to) such secured Debt, so long as such secured Debt
shall be so secured, unless, after giving effect thereto, the
aggregate amount of all such secured Debt (plus all Attribut-
able Debt not otherwise permitted by the second paragraph of
Section 1009) would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Assets;
provided, however, that this Section 1004 shall not apply to,
and there shall be excluded from secured Debt in any computa-
tion under this Section 1004, Debt secured by:

(1) Mortgages on property of, or on any shares of
Capital Stock of or Debt of, any corporation existing at
the time such corporation becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

ment thereto or to secure any Debt incurred prior to, at
the time of, or within 180 days after (A) the acquisition
of such property, shares of Capital Stock or Debt or (B)

tion of construction, substantial repair or alteration
thereon or development or substantial improvement thereto

erty for the purpose of financing all or any part of the
purchase price thereof or the cost of construction,
substantial repair or alteration thereon or development
or substantial improvement thereto;

like liens arising in the ordinary course of business
(including construction of facilities) in respect of obli-
gations which are not due or which are being contested in
good faith;

(6) Any Mortgage arising by reason of deposits with,
or the giving of any form of security to, any governmental

tal regulation as a condition to the transaction of any
business, or the exercise of any privilege, franchise or
license;

ture; and

(10) Any extension, renewal or replacement (or suc-

such extension, renewal or replacement Mortgage shall be
limited to all or part of the same property, shares of
Capital Stock or Debt that secured the Mortgage extended,
renewed or replaced (plus improvements on such property).

SECTION 1005. Statement as to Compliance.

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120
days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending
after the date of the first issuance of Securities hereunder, a
certificate of the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer or chief accounting officer, stating, as to each signer
thereof, that

(1) a review of the activities of the Company during
such year and of performance under this Indenture has been
made under his supervision, and

(2) to the best of his knowledge, based on such
review, the Company has complied with all of its condi-
tions and covenants under this Indenture, or if the Com-
pany has not so complied, specifying each such default
known to him and the nature and status thereof.

amount of the outstanding Securities of each series shall, by

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-82-

Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such
instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provi-
sion, covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to
or affect such term, provision, covenant or condition except to
the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall
become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties
of the Trustee with respect to any such term, provision, cove-
nant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.

SECTION 1008. Additional Amounts.

If the Securities of a series provide for the payment
of additional amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of
any Security of such series or any coupon appertaining thereto
additional amounts as provided therein. Whenever in this
Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of
the principal of or any premium or interest on, or in respect
of, any Security of any series or payment of any related coupon
or the net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of any
Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include
mention of the payment of additional amounts provided for in
this Section to the extent that, in such context, additional
amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursu-
ant to the provisions of this Section and express mention of
the payment of additional amounts (if applicable) in any provi-
sions hereof shall not be construed as excluding additional
amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention
is not made.

If the Securities of a series provide for the payment
of additional amounts, at least 10 days prior to the first
Interest Payment Date with respect to that series of Securities
(or if the Securities of that series will not bear interest
prior to Maturity, the first day on which a payment of princi-
pal and any premium is made), and at least 10 days prior to
each date of payment of principal and any premium or interest
if there has been any change with respect to the matters set
forth in the below-mentioned Officers' Certificate, the Company
will furnish the Trustee and the Company's principal Paying
Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, with an
Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying
Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal of and
any premium or interest on the Securities of that series shall
be made to one or more Holders of Securities of that series or
any related coupons who are United States Aliens without with-
holding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other gov-
ernmental charge described in the Securities of that series.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-83-

If any such withholding shall be required, then such Officers'
Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any,
required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of
Securities or coupons and the Company will pay to the Trustee
or such Paying Agent the additional amounts required by this
Section. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee and
any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negli-
gence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connec-
tion with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance
on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this
Section.

SECTION 1009. Restrictions on Sales and Leasebacks.

The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of
each series of Securities, other than any series established
pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more supplemental
indentures hereto which specifically provides otherwise, that
it will not itself, and will not permit any Restricted Subsid-
iary to enter into any sale and leaseback transaction involving
any Principal Property, unless after giving effect thereto the
aggregate amount of all Attributable Debt with respect to all
such transactions (plus all secured Debt not otherwise permitted
by clauses 1 through 10 of Section 1004) would not exceed 10% of
Consolidated Net Assets.

This restriction will not apply to, and there shall
be excluded from Attributable Debt in any computation under
such restriction, any sale and leaseback transaction if (a) the
lease is for a period, including renewal rights, of not in
excess of three years, (b) the sale or transfer of the Princi-
pal Property is made within 180 days after its acquisition or
within 180 days after the later of (1) the completion of con-
struction, substantial repair or alteration thereon or develop-
ment or substantial improvement thereto, or (2) commencement of
commercial operations thereon, (c) the transaction is between the
Company and a Restricted Subsidiary, or between Restricted
Subsidiaries, (d) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary would be
entitled to incur a Mortgage on such Principal Property pursuant
to clauses 1 through 10 of Section 1004, or (e) the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary, within 180 days after the sale or 
transfer is completed, applies to the retirement of Funded Debt
of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary ranking on a parity
with or senior to the Securities, or to the purchase of other
property which will constitute a Principal Property having a 
fair market value at least equal to the fair market value of the
Principal Property leased, an amount equal to the greater

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-84-

of the net proceeds of the sale of the Principal Property or
the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors)
of the Principal Property leased at the time of entering into
such arrangement (as determined by the Board of Directors).

ARTICLE ELEVEN

REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES

SECTION 1101. Applicability of This Article.

Securities of any series which are redeemable before
their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with
their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated
by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with
this Article.

SECTION 1102. Election To Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities
shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any
redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the
Securities of any series, the Company shall, at least 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a
shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount
of Securities of such series to be redeemed, such notice to be
accompanied by a written statement signed by an Authorized
Officer of the Company stating that no defaults in the payment
of interest or Events of Default with respect to the Securities
of that series have occurred (which have not been waived or
cured). In the case of any redemption of Securities (i) prior
to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption pro-
vided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this
Indenture, or (ii) pursuant to an election of the Company which
is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Secu-
rities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers'
Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or
condition.

SECTION 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities
To Be Redeemed. 

If less than all the Securities of any series are to
be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be
selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by
the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-85-

previously called for redemption by lot or by such other method
as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may
provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to
the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that
series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal
amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger
than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that
series or of portions of the principal amount of global Securi-
ties of such series.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the
case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the con-
text otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemp-
tion of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities
redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the
principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be
redeemed.

SECTION 1104. Notice of Redemption.

Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner
provided in Section 106 not more than 60 days nor less than 30
days prior to the Redemption Date, to the Holders of Securities
to be redeemed.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price and any accrued interest;

(3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any
series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the
case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the
particular Securities to be redeemed;

(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption
Price, and any accrued interest thereon, will become due
and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and
that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after
said date;

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-86-

(5) the place or places where such Securities are,
together in the case of Bearer Securities with all coupons
appertaining thereto, if any, maturing after the Redemp-
tion Date, to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption
Price and any accrued interest thereon;

(6) If such be the case, that the installment of
interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is
the Redemption Date is payable to the Persons in whose
names such Registered Securities are registered at the
close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately
preceding the Redemption Date; and

(7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if
such is the case.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed
shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by
the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.

SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.

Not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on any
Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or
with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own
Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Sec-
tion 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption
Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Inter-
est Date) any accrued interest on, all the Securities which are
to be redeemed on that date.

SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date,
become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein speci-
fied together with any accrued interest thereon and from and
after such date (unless the Company shall default in the pay-
ment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest), such Secu-
rities shall cease to bear interest and the coupons for such
interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be
redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void.
Upon surrender of any such Securities for redemption in accor-
dance with said notice, such Securities shall be paid by the
Company at the Redemption Price, together with any accrued
interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that any
installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-87-

Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable
only at an office or agency located outside the United States
(except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon
presentation and surrender of coupons for such interest, and
provided, further, that, unless otherwise specified as contem-
plated by Section 301, installments of interest on Registered
Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemp-
tion Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities,
or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at
the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to
their terms and the provisions of Section 307.

If any Bearer Security which is to be redeemed in
whole or in part (as set forth in Section 1107) when surren-
dered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurte-
nant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security
may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount
equal to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the
surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by
the Company or jointly by the Company and the Trustee if there
be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may
require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If
thereafter, a Holder shall surrender to the Trustee or any Pay-
ing Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduc-
tion shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such
Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted;
provided, however, that interest represented by coupons shall
be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those cou-
pons at an office or agency located outside of the United
States except as otherwise provided in Section 1002.

If the Company shall default in the payment of the
Redemption Price and accrued interest on any Security called
for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) of such
Security shall, until paid or until payment is provided for in
accordance herewith, bear interest from the Redemption Date at
the rate, if any, prescribed therefor in the Security.

So long as it is known to the Trustee that an Event
of Default is continuing hereunder, the Trustee shall not
redeem any Securities of any series pursuant to this Article
(unless all outstanding Securities of such series are to be
redeemed) or mail or give any notice of redemption of Securi-
ties except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of
any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee
shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-88-

that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient
for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any monies thereto-
fore or thereafter received by the Trustee shall, during the
continuance of such Event of Default, be deemed to have been
collected under Article Five and held for the payment of all
such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been
waived as provided in Section 513 or the default cured on or
before the sixtieth day preceding the Redemption Date, such
monies shall thereafter be applied in accordance with the pro-
visions of this Article.

SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.

Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part
shall be surrendered at any Place of Payment therefor (with, if
the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or
a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing) together, in the case
of Bearer Securities, with all coupons appertaining thereto
maturing after the Redemption Date, and the Company shall exe-
cute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the
Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security
or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any
authorized denomination as requested by the Holder, in an
aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the
unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so
surrendered.

ARTICLE TWELVE

SINKING FUNDS

SECTION 1201. Applicability of Article.

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to
any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series
except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301
for the Securities of such series.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment pro-
vided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein
referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any pay-
ment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms
of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as an
"optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms
of the Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-89-

fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section
1202. Each sinking fund payment made on the Securities of a
series shall be applied to the redemption of the Securities of
such series as provided for by the terms of the Securities of
such series.

SECTION 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund
Payments With Securities. 

The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of
a series (other than any previously called for redemption),
together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series
with all unmatured coupons appertaining thereto, and (2) may
apply as a credit the Securities of a series which have been
redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the
terms of such Securities or through the application of permit-
ted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of
such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any
part of any sinking fund payment as specified in the Officers'
Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 1203 with respect to
the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to
the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of
such series; provided that such Securities have not been previ-
ously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and cred-
ited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price
specified in such Securities for redemption through operation
of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment
shall be reduced accordingly.

SECTION 1203. Redemption of Securities 
for Sinking Fund. 

Not less than 60 days or such other shorter period as
may be acceptable to the Trustee prior to each sinking fund
payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will
deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the
amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series
pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if
any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the por-
tion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering
and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section
1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be
so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking
fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be
redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner
specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption
thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
-90-

Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice
having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall
be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections
1106 and 1107.

rization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided by this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Hold-
ers of Securities of such series.

SECTION 1302. Call, Notice and Place of Meetings.

(a) The Trustee may at any time call a meeting of

ties or as Bearer Securities and Registered Securities for any
purpose specified in Section 1301, to be held at such time and
at such place in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, or in London as the Trustee shall determine. Notice of

to be taken at such meeting with respect to a consent or waiver
as to which this Indenture or the terms of such series
expressly provides may be given by Holders of not less than a

amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series issuable as
Bearer Securities or as Bearer Securities and Registered Secu-
rities shall have requested the Trustee to call a meeting of
the Holders of Securities of such series for any purpose speci-
fied in Section 1301, by written request setting forth in rea-
sonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting,
and the Trustee shall not have made the first publication of
the notice of such meeting within 21 days after receipt of such
request or shall not thereafter proceed to cause the meeting to

ough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or in London for such
meeting and may call such meeting for such purposes by giving

such series, be dissolved. In any other case the meeting may
be adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as deter-
mined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment
of such meeting. In the absence of a quorum at any such
adjourned meeting, such adjourned meeting may be further
adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as determined
by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such
adjourned meeting. Notice of the reconvening of any adjourned
meeting shall be given as provided in Section 1302(a), except

SECTION 1305. Determination of Voting Rights;
Conduct and Adjournment of Meeting.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as
it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of Securities
of a series in regard to proof of the holding of Securities of
such series and of the appointment of proxies and in regard to
the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submis-
sion and examination of proxies, certificates and other evi-
dence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning
the conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate.
Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regula-
tions, the holding of Securities shall be proved in the manner
specified in Section 104 and the appointment of any proxy shall
be proved in the manner specified in Section 104 or by having
the signature of the person executing the proxy witnessed or
guaranteed by any trust company, bank or banker authorized by
Section 104 to certify to the holding of Bearer Securities.
Such regulations may provide that written instruments appoint-
ing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed valid and
genuine without the proof specified in Section 104 or other
proof.

(b) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing,
appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting
shall have been called by the Company or by Holders of Securi-
ties as provided in Section 1302(b), in which case the Company
or the Holders of Securities of the series calling the meeting,
as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary
chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of
the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to
vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securi-
ties of such series represented at the meeting.

(c) At any meeting each Holder of a Security of such
series or proxy shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series
held or represented by him; provided, however, that no vote
shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Secu-
rity challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of
the meeting to be not Outstanding. The chairman of the meeting
shall have no right to vote, except as a Holder of a Security
of such series or proxy.

(d) Any meeting of Holders of Securities of any
series duly called pursuant to Section 1302 at which a quorum

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

is present may be adjourned from time to time by Persons enti-
tled to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of such series represented at the meeting; and the
meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

SECTION 1306. Counting Votes and Recording
Action of Meetings.

The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting
of Holders of Securities of any series shall be by written bal-
lots on which shall be subscribed the signatures of the Holders
of Securities of such series or of their representatives by
proxy and the principal amounts and serial numbers of the Out-
standing Securities of such series held or represented by them.
The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspec-
tors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for
or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the
secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in
duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record, at least
in duplicate, of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders of
Securities of any series shall be prepared by the secretary of
the meeting and there shall be attached to said record the
original reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by bal-
lot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having
knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the Notice of
the meeting and showing that said notice was given as provided
in Section 1302 and, if applicable, Section 1304. Each copy
shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent
chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such copy shall
be delivered to the Company, and another to the Trustee to be
preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto
the ballots voted at the meeting. Any record so signed and
verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein
stated.

This instrument may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be
an original, but all such counterparts shall together consti-
tute but one and the same instrument.

thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

such obligation to pay such additional amounts remains in
effect, or (ii) in the written opinion of independent counsel

the Company has or will become obligated to pay such additional
amounts as a result of any action taken by any taxing authority
or of any action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction
in the United States or any political subdivision thereof or
therein, including any of the actions described in (i) above,
whether or not such action has been taken or brought with
respect to the Company, or as a result of any officially pro-

[If the Securities of the series are issuable as
Bearer Securities and if applicable, insert- In addition, if

interest, if any, due with respect to any Bearer Security or
coupon would, under any present or future laws or regulations
of the United States, be subject to any certification, identi-
fication or other reporting requirement of any kind, the effect
of which requirement is the disclosure to the Company, any Pay-
ing Agent or any governmental authority of the nationality,
residence or identity of a beneficial owner of such Bearer
Security or coupon who is a United States Alien (as defined on
the face hereof (other than such a requirement (a) which would
not be applicable to a payment made by the Company or any one

(a)(ii) and (b) that payment by such custodian, nominee or
other agent of such beneficial owner is not otherwise subject
to any such requirement), the Company at its election will
either (x) redeem the Securities, as a whole but not in part,
at a Redemption Price [equal to 100% of their principal amount]
[determined as set forth in the next preceding paragraph,]
together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemp-
tion, or (y) if and so long as any such certification, identi-
fication or other reporting requirement would be fully satis-
fied by payment of a backup withholding tax or similar charge,
pay to the Holders of Bearer Securities who are United States
Aliens certain additional amounts specified in the Bearer Secu-
rities of this series. The Company will make such determina-
tion and election and notify the Trustee thereof as soon as
practicable, and the Trustee will promptly give notice of such
determination in the manner provided below (the "Determination
Notice"), in each case stating the effective date of such cer-
tification, identification or other reporting requirement,
whether the Company will redeem the Securities or will pay to
the Holders of Bearer Securities who are United States Aliens
the additional amounts specified in the Bearer Securities of
this series and (if applicable) the last day by which the
redemption of the Securities must take place. If the Company
elects to redeem the Securities, such redemption shall take
place on such date, not later than one year after publication
of the Determination Notice, as the Company elects by notice to
the Trustee at least 60 days before such date, unless shorter
notice is acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the fore-
going, the Company will not so redeem the Securities if the
Company, based upon an opinion of independent counsel selected
by the Company subsequently determines, not less than 10 days
prior to the date fixed for redemption, that subsequent pay-
ments would not be subject to any such requirement, in which
case the Company will notify the Trustee, which will promptly
give notice of that determination in the manner provided below,
and any earlier redemption notice will thereupon be revoked and
of no further effect. If the Company elects as provided in
clause (y) above to pay such additional amounts to the Holders
of Bearer Securities who are United States Aliens, and as long
as the Company is obligated to pay such additional amounts to
such Holders, the Company may subsequently redeem the Securi-
ties, at any time, as a whole but not in part, at a Redemption
Price [equal to 100% of their principal amount] [determined as
set forth in the next preceding paragraph,] together with

<PAGE>

interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, but without
reduction for applicable United States withholding taxes.]

[The sinking fund for this series provides for the
redemption on __________ in each year, beginning with the year
_____ and ending with the year _____ of [not less than] [U.S.]
$__________ [("mandatory sinking fund") and not more than [U.S.
$__________] aggregate principal amount of Securities of this
series. [Securities of this series acquired or redeemed by the
Company otherwise than through [mandatory] sinking fund pay-
ments may be credited against subsequent [mandatory] sinking
fund payments otherwise required to be made in the inverse
order in which they become due.]]

[Notice of redemption will be given by mail to Hold-
ers of [If the Securities of the series are issuable as Bearer
Securities, insert- Registered] Securities, not more than 60
days nor less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemp-
tion, all as provided in this Indenture.]

In the event of redemption of this Security in part
only, a new [If the Securities of the series are issuable as
Bearer Securities, insert- Registered] Security or Securities
of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion
hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
cancellation hereof.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
this series shall occur and be continuing, [the] [If an Origi-
nal Issue Discount Security, insert- an amount of] principal of
the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable
in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
[If an Original Issue Discount Security, insert- Such amount
shall be equal to to-insert formula for determining the amount.
Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and
payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and over-
due interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of
such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Compa-
ny's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of
and interest, if any, on the Securities of this series shall
terminate.]

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as
therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of
the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected [If the

Securities of the series are issuable as Bearer Securities and
are interest-bearing, insert- and any related coupons] under
the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be
affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting
the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding (with each
series voting as a separate class in certain cases specified in
the Indenture, or with all series voting as one class, in cer-
tain other cases specified in the Indenture), on behalf of the
Holders of all Securities of such series [If the Securities of
the series are issuable as Bearer Securities [and are
interest-bearing] insert- and any related coupons], to waive
compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Inden-
ture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and
upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notification of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of the
Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have
any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the
Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder
shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Out-
standing Securities of this series shall have made written
request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not
have received from the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction
inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to insti-
tute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that
such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the
Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal
of [(and premium, if any)] and [any] interest on this Security
on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provi-
sions of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or
impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay the principal of [(and premium, if any)]

and [any] interest [(including additional amounts, as described
on the face hereof)] on this Security at the times, place[s]
and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

able as Bearer Securities, insert- Registered] Securities of
this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and

Bearer Securities insert- The Securities of this series are
issuable only in registered form, without coupons, in denomina-
tions of [$]__________ and any integral multiple thereof. As
provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable
for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this
series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomina-
tion, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.]

No service charge shall be made for any such regis-
tration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other govern-
mental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for regis-
tration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of
the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name
this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all pur-
poses, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by

pany would incur adverse consequences under then applicable
United States Federal income tax laws and (ii) in the case of
the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, the
Company shall have delivered to such Person an Officers' Cer-

this Security] to any United States Alien who is a fiduciary or
partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of any such
payment to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with
respect to such fiduciary, a member of such a partnership or
the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to the addi-
tional amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or benefi-
cial owner been the Holder of this Security [If the Security is
interest-bearing, insert- or any coupon appertaining hereto].
In the case of net proceeds from the sale or exchange of a
Bearer Security, additional amounts with respect to such net

have been payable if the Bearer Security had been redeemed for
its issue price plus accrued original issue discount at the
time of such sale or exchange or (b) be paid in respect of any
sale or exchange occurring after the date fixed for redemption
of such Security. Except as previously provided herein with
respect to Bearer Securities, the Company shall not be required
to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or
other governmental charge imposed by any government or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein
and may make such withholdings and deductions on account of any
such charge as may be required by applicable law or regulation.

stating in the Determination Notice (as defined in such para-
graph), to have the provisions of this paragraph apply in lieu
of the provisions of such paragraph. In such event, the Com-
pany will pay as additional amounts such amounts as may be nec-
essary so that every net payment made following the effective
date of such requirements outside the United States by the Com-
pany or any of its Paying Agents of principal [(and premiums,
if any)] [If the Security is interest-bearing, insert- or

or any governmental authority), after deduction or withholding
for or on account of such backup withholding tax or similar
charge other than a backup withholding tax or similar charge
which is (i) the result of a certification, identification or
other reporting requirement described in the second parentheti-

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of
securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"),
issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Inden-
ture, dated as of January 1, 1994 (herein called the "Inden-
ture"), between the Company and The First National Bank of Chi-
cago, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term
includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is
hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limita-
tions of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Com-
pany, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities are, and

of this series are issuable as Bearer Securities, with interest
coupons attached, in the denomination of [U.S. $.........[, and
as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of

vided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, Bearer Securities and Registered Securities
of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount of Registered Securities of this series and of like
tenor of any authorized denominations, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Security or
Securities to be exchanged, with all unmatured coupons and all
matured coupons in default thereto appertaining, at any office
or agency described below where Registered Securities of this
series may be presented for registration of transfer, provided,
however, that Bearer Securities surrendered in exchange for
Registered Securities between a Record Date and the relevant
Interest Payment Date shall be surrendered without the coupon
relating to such Interest Payment Date. Bearer Securities may
not be issued in exchange for Registered Securities.]

financial practice) of less than ...% per annum.]

to pay such additional amounts remains in effect or (ii) in the
written opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company
there is a substantial likelihood that the Company has or will
become obligated to pay such additional amounts as a result of
any action taken by any taxing authority or of any action
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the United
States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, includ-
ing any of the actions described in (i) above, whether or not
such action has been taken or brought with respect to the Com-
pany, or as a result of any officially proposed Tax Law Change,
which action or proposed change occurs after ............

[If applicable, insert - In addition, if the Company
determines, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel
selected by the Company, that any payment made outside the
United States by the Company or any of its Paying Agents of the
full amount of principal [(, premium, if any)] or interest due
with respect to any Bearer Security or coupon would, under any
present or future laws or regulations of the United States, be
subject to any certification, identification or other reporting
requirement of any kind, the effect of which requirement is the
disclosure to the Company, any Paying Agent or any governmental
authority of the nationality, residence or identity of a bene-
ficial owner of such Bearer Security or coupon who is a United
States Alien (as defined on the face hereof) (other than such a
requirement (a) which would not be applicable to a payment made
by the Company or any one of its Paying Agents (i) directly to
the beneficial owner, or (ii) to any custodian, nominee or
other agent of the beneficial owner, or (b) which can be satis-
fied by the custodian, nominee or other agent certifying that
the beneficial owner is a United States Alien, provided in each
case referred to in clauses (a)(ii) and (b) that payment by
such custodian, nominee or other agent of such beneficial owner
is not otherwise subject to any such requirement), the Company
at its election will either (x) redeem the Securities, as a
whole but not in part, at a Redemption Price [equal to 100% of
their principal amount,] [determined as set forth in the next

preceding paragraph,] together with interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption, or (y) if and so long as the condi-
tions of the [third] paragraph on the face of this Security are
satisfied, pay the additional amounts specified in such para-
graph. The Company will make such determination and election
and notify the Trustee thereof as soon as practicable, and the
Trustee will promptly give notice of such determination in the
manner provided below (the "Determination Notice"), in each
case stating the effective date of such certification, identi-
fication or other reporting requirement, whether the Company
will redeem the Securities or will pay the additional amounts
specified in such paragraph and (if applicable) the last day by
which the redemption of the Securities must take place. If the
Company elects to redeem the Securities, such redemption shall
take place on such date, not later than one year after publica-
tion of the Determination Notice, as the Company elects by
notice to the Trustee at least 60 days before such date, unless
shorter notice is acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company will not so redeem the Securities if
the Company, based upon an opinion of independent counsel
selected by the Company, subsequently determines, not less than
10 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, that subsequent
payments would not be subject to any such requirement, in which
case the Company will notify the Trustee, which will promptly
give notice of that determination in the manner provided below,
and any earlier redemption notice will thereupon be revoked and
of no further effect. If the Company elects as provided in
clause (y) above to pay such additional amounts, the Company
may subsequently redeem the Securities, at any time, as a whole
or in part, at a Redemption Price [equal to 100% of their prin-
cipal amount] [determined as set forth in the next preceding
paragraph,] together with interest accrued to the date fixed
for redemption, but without reduction for applicable United
States withholding taxes.]

[If applicable, insert - In addition, if the Company
determines, based upon a written opinion of independent counsel
selected by the Company, that any payment made outside the
United States by the Company or any of its Paying Agents of the
full amount due with respect to any Bearer Security would,
under any present or future laws or regulations of the United
States, be subject to any certification, identification or
other reporting requirement of any kind, the effect of which
requirement is the disclosure to the Company, any Paying Agent
or any governmental authority of the nationality, residence or
identity of a beneficial owner of such Bearer Security who is a
United States Alien (as defined on the face hereof) (other than

<PAGE>

such a requirement (a) which would not be applicable to a pay-
ment made by the Company or any one of its Paying Agents (i)
directly to the beneficial owner or (ii) to any custodian, nom-
inee or other agent of the beneficial owner, or (b) which can
be satisfied by the custodian, nominee or other agent certify-
ing to the effect that such beneficial owner is a United States
Alien, provided in each case referred to in clauses (a)(ii) and
(b) that payment by such custodian, nominee or other agent of
such beneficial owner is not otherwise subject to any such
requirement), the Company at its election will either (x) per-
mit any Holder of a Bearer Security to present such Bearer
Security for redemption within 90 days of notice of such
redemption, at a Redemption Price determined as set forth in
the next preceding paragraph, or (y) if and so long as the con-
ditions of the [fifth] paragraph on the face of this Security
are satisfied, pay the additional amounts specified in such
paragraph. The Company will make such determination and elec-
tion and notify the Trustee thereof as soon as practicable, and
the Trustee will promptly give notice of such determination in
the manner provided below (the "Determination Notice"), in each
case stating the effective date of such certification, identi-
fication or other reporting requirement, whether the Company
has elected to permit redemption of the Bearer Securities or to
pay the additional amounts specified in such paragraph and (if
applicable) the last day by which the Company may publish any
notice of redemption. If the Company elects to permit redemp-
tion of the Bearer Securities, notice of the redemption will be
given not more than 268 days following the Determination Notice
and will specify the date fixed for redemption. The Bearer
Securities will be redeemed on the day 97 days after notice of
the redemption has been given. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company will not permit redemption of the Bearer Securities
if the Company, based upon an opinion of independent counsel,
subsequently determines, not less than 10 days prior to the
date fixed for redemption, that no payment would be subject to
any such requirement, in which case the Company will promptly
notify the Trustee, which will promptly give notice of that
determination in the manner described below, and any earlier
redemption notice will thereupon be revoked and of no further
effect.]

[The sinking fund for this series provides for the
redemption on ................. in each year, beginning with
the year ........ and ending with the year ........, of [not
less than] [U.S.] $......... [("mandatory sinking fund") and
not more than [U.S. $.........]] aggregate principal amount of
Securities of this series. [Securities of this series acquired

datory] sinking fund payments otherwise required to be made --
in the inverse order in which they become due.]]

[Notice of redemption will be given by publication in
an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and, if the
Securities of this series are then listed on [The International
Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ire-
land Limited] [the Luxembourg Stock Exchange] [or] any [other]
stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock
exchange shall so require, in [London] [Luxembourg] [or] in any
[other] required city outside the United States, or, if not
practicable, elsewhere in Europe, [and by mail to Holders of
Registered Securities] not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the
Indenture.]

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
this series shall occur and be continuing, [the] [If an Origi-
nal Issue Discount Security, insert - an amount of] principal
of the Securities of the series may be declared due and payable
in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture
[the] [If an Original Issue Discount Security, insert - such
amount shall be equal to - insert formula for determining the
amount. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so
declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue
principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that
the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all
of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the
principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of this
series shall terminate.]

The Indenture permits with certain exceptions as
therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of
the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected [If
the Securities of the series are interest-bearing, insert - and
any related coupons] under the Indenture at any time by the
Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Out-
standing of each series to be affected. The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified per-
centages in principal amount of the Securities of each series
at the time Outstanding (with each series voting as a separate
class in certain cases specified in the Indenture, or with all
series voting as one class, in certain other cases specified in

the Indenture), on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of
such series [If the Securities of the series are interest-bear-
ing, insert - and any related coupons], to waive compliance by
the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and cer-
tain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.
Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall
be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future
Holders of this Security and any coupon appertaining hereto and
of any Security issued in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof,
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon
this Security.

As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of
the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series [If the
Security is interest-bearing, insert - or any related coupon]
will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to
the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder
shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Out-
standing Securities of this series shall have made written
request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not
have received from the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction
inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to insti-
tute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that
such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the
Holder hereof [If the Security in interest-bearing, insert - or
any related coupon] for the enforcement of payment for the
principal of [(and premium, if any)] or [any] interest on this
Security [If the Security is interest-bearing, insert - or pay-

The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee may treat the bearer of a Bearer Security or any

pany would incur adverse consequences under then applicable
United States Federal income tax laws and (ii) in the case of
the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, the
Company shall have delivered to such Person an Officers'

[Form of Reverse]

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of
securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"),
issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Inden-
ture, dated as of February 1, 1994 (herein called the "Inden-
ture"), between the Company and The First National Bank of
Chicago, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term
includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is
hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limita-
tions of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the
Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of
the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authen-
ticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series
designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal
amount to U.S. $100,000,000. 

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the
Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in
the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon
payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and
payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and
overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment
of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the
Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the princi-
pal of and interest, if any, on the Securities of this series
shall terminate.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as
therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of
the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under
the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be
affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting
the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding (with each
series voting as a separate class in certain cases specified in
the Indenture, or with all series voting as one class, in
certain other cases specified in the Indenture), on behalf of
the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compli-
ance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture
and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their conse-
quences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and
upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notification of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of the
Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have
any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the
Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder
shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, (ii)
the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written
request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as trustee, (iii) the Trustee shall
not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction
inconsistent with such request and (iv) the Trustee shall have
failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after its
receipt of such notice; provided, however, that such limita-
tions do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof
for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premi-
um, if any) and interest on this Security on or after the
respective due dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provi-
sions of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or
impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and
in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is
registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this
Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency
of the Company in any place where the principal of (and premi-
um, if any) and interest on such Security are payable, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar
duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities
of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations
and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to
the designated transferee or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in
registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000
and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Inden-
ture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth,
Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate
principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such regis-
tration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other govern-
mental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for regis-
tration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of
the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name
this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purpos-
es, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or in the
terms of this Security to the contrary, the exchange of this
Security for a Registered Security will be subject to satisfac-
tion of the provisions of the United States tax laws in effect
at the time of the exchange. Neither the Company nor the
Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be
required to exchange this Security for a Registered Security if
(i) as a result thereof and in the Company's judgment, the
Company would incur adverse consequences under then applicable
United States Federal income tax laws and (ii) in the case of
the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, the
Company shall have delivered to such Person an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as to the matters set
forth in clause (i) above.

The Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to the conflicts of laws provisions
thereof.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in
the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.

February 1994

AVNET, INC.

DEBT SECURITIES

STANDARD UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT PROVISIONS

1. Introductory. Avnet, Inc., a New York corpora-
tion (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell from time to
time certain of its debt securities registered under the
registration statement referred to in Section 3(a) ("Securi-
ties"). The Securities will be issued under an indenture,
dated as of February 1, 1994 (such indenture as amended or
supplemented is herein referred to as the "Indenture"), between
the Company and The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee,
in one or more series, which series may vary as to interest
rates, maturities, redemption provisions, selling prices and
other terms, with all such terms for any particular series of
the Securities being determined at the time of sale. Particu-
lar series of the Securities will be sold pursuant to a Pricing
Agreement referred to in Section 2, for resale in accordance
with terms of offering determined at the time of sale.

The firm or firms which agree to purchase the Securi-
ties are hereinafter referred to as the "Underwriters" of such
Securities, and the representative or representatives of the
Underwriters, if any, specified in a Pricing Agreement referred
to in Section 2 are hereinafter referred to as the "Representa-
tives"; provided, however, that if the Pricing Agreement does
not specify any representative of the Underwriters, the term
"Representatives," as used in this Agreement (other than in the
second sentence of Section 2), shall mean the Underwriters.

2. Purchase and Offering of Securities. The
obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities will
be evidenced by an exchange of written communications ("Pricing
Agreement") at the time the Company determines to sell the
Securities. The Pricing Agreement will incorporate by refer-
ence the provisions of this Agreement, except as otherwise
provided therein, and will specify (1) the firm or firms which
will be Underwriters, (2) the names of any Representatives, (3)
the principal amount of Securities to be purchased by each
Underwriter and the purchase price to be paid by the Underwrit-
ers, (4) the terms of the Securities not already specified in
the Indenture, (5) the time and date on which delivery of the
Securities will be made to the Representatives for the ac-
counts of the several Underwriters against payment by the
several Underwriters through the Representatives of the pur-
chase price in New York Clearing House funds (such time and
date, or such other time and date not later than seven full
business days thereafter as the Representatives and the Company
agree to as to time and date for payment and delivery, being
herein and in the Pricing Agreement referred to as the "Closing
Date") and (6) the place of delivery and payment.

The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the
Securities will be several and not joint. The Securities
delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date will be in
definitive fully registered form, in such denominations and
registered in such names as the Representatives may request.

Certificates for the Securities shall be registered
in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives
may request not less than two full Business Days in advance of
the Closing Date.

3. Representations and Warranties of the Company: 
The Company represents and warrants to each of the Underwriters
as of the date of execution of the Pricing Agreement (the
"Representation Date") and as of the Closing Date that:

(a) the Company is permitted to use Form S-3 under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and
has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") a registration statement on such Form, which
has become effective, for the registration under the Act
of the Securities. Such registration statement, as amend-
ed at the date of this Agreement, meets the requirements
set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x) under the Act and complies
in all other material respects with said Rule. Such
registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as
amended at the date of any Pricing Agreement, is hereinaf-
ter called the "Registration Statement" and the prospectus
included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented to
reflect the terms of any series of the Securities and the
plan of distribution thereof, in the form in which it
shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(b), is hereinafter called the "Prospectus." Any
reference herein to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus shall be deemed to include the documents incor-
porated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form
S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act") on or before the date of this
Agreement or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may
be, and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amend-
ment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to include the
filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the
date of this Agreement or the date of the Prospectus, as
the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference;

(b) as of the date of any Pricing Agreement, when
the Prospectus is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)
under the Act, when, prior to the Closing Date, any amend-
ment to the Registration Statement becomes effective
(including the filing of any document incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement) and at the Clos-
ing Date, (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of
any such time, and the Prospectus, as amended or supple-
mented as of any such time, and the Indenture will comply
in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust
Indenture Act") and the Exchange Act and the respective
rules thereunder and (ii) neither the Registration State-
ment, as amended as of any such time, nor the Prospectus,
as amended or supplemented as of any such time, will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no
warranty or representation with respect to any statement
contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
in reliance upon and in conformity with information fur-
nished in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter
through the Representatives to the Company expressly for
use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus; 

(c) all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly
authorized and issued and are fully paid, non-assessable

the Company and each of its subsidiaries (the "Subsidiar-
ies") have been duly incorporated and are validly existing
as corporations in good standing under the laws of their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation, with full power
and authority to own their respective properties and
conduct their respective businesses as described in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus; the Company has
full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, the Pricing Agreement and the Indenture and to
issue and sell the Securities as herein contemplated;

(d) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
duly qualified or licensed by and are in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which they conduct their respective
businesses and in which the failure, individually or in 
the aggregate, to be so licensed or qualified could have a
material adverse effect on the operations, business or
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and with respect to the Company the jurisdictions
listed on Schedule A hereto constitute a complete list of
such jurisdictions in which the Company is required to be
so licensed or qualified; and the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects
with the laws, orders, rules, regulations and directives
issued or administered by such jurisdictions;

hereby agrees:

(a) to furnish such information as may be reasonably
required by and otherwise to cooperate with, the Represen-
tatives in qualifying the Securities for offering and sale
under the securities or blue sky laws of such states as
the Representatives may designate (including the provi-
sions of Florida blue sky law, if requested, relating to
issuers doing business with Cuba) and to maintain such
qualifications in effect as long as required for the
distribution of the Securities, provided that the Company
shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation
or a dealer or to consent to the service of process under
the laws of any such state (except service of process with
respect to the offering and sale of the Securities) or to
take any action which would or could subject the Company
to taxation in any state where it is not now so subject;
and to promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt
by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale
in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of
any proceeding for such purpose;

(b) to make available to the Representatives in New
York City, as soon as practicable after the Registration
Statement becomes effective, and thereafter from time to
time to furnish to the Underwriters, as many copies of the
Prospectus (or of the Prospectus as amended or supplement-
ed if the Company shall have made any amendments or sup-
plements thereto after the effective date of the Registra-
tion Statement) as the Underwriters may reasonably request
for the purposes contemplated by the Act;

(c) that the Company will use its best efforts to
cause any amendment of the Registration Statement to
become effective promptly. The Company will not file any
amendment to the Registration Statement or amendment or
supplement to the Prospectus relating to any series of the
Securities to which the Underwriters of such series shall
object in writing after a reasonable opportunity to review
the same. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company
will cause each Prospectus supplement relating to the
Securities to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the
applicable paragraph of Rule 424 within the time period
prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the
Underwriters of such timely filing. The Company will
promptly advise the Underwriters of any series of Securi-
ties (A) when any Prospectus supplement relating to such
series shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 424, (B) when, prior to termination of the offer-
ing of such series, any amendment to the Registration
Statement shall have been filed with the Commission or
become effective, (C) of any request by the Commission for
any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement
to the Prospectus or for any additional information,
(D) of the receipt by the Company of any notification of
the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspend-
ing the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or
the use of any Prospectus or Prospectus supplement or, if
the Company has knowledge, of the institution or threat of
any proceeding for that purpose and (E) of the receipt by
the Company of any notification with respect to the sus-
pension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction or, if the Company has knowledge, of the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

the issuance of any such stop order or of any order sus-
pending or preventing any such use and, if issued, to
obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof;

(d) to furnish to the Representatives and, upon
request, to each of the other Underwriters for a period of
three years from the date of each Pricing Agreement

time to time publish or publicly disseminate, (ii) copies
of all annual, quarterly and current reports filed with
the Commission on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, or such other
similar form as may be designated by the Commission, and
(iii) such other information as the Representatives may
reasonably request regarding the Company or its Subsidiar-
ies;

(e) to advise the Underwriters of a series of Secu-
rities promptly of the happening of any event known to the
Company within the time during which a prospectus relating
to such series is required to be delivered under the Act
which, in the judgment of the Company, would require the
making of any change in the Prospectus then being used, or
in the information incorporated therein by reference, so
that the Prospectus would not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact neces-
sary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
and, during such time, to prepare and furnish, at the
Company's expense, to the Underwriters promptly such
amendments or supplements to such Prospectus as may be
necessary to reflect any such change and to furnish to the
Representatives a copy of such proposed amendment or
supplement before filing any such amendment or supplement
with the Commission;

(f) that, as soon as practicable after the date of
each Pricing Agreement, the Company will make generally
available to its Security holders an earnings statement

Securities in the manner set forth under the caption "Use
of Proceeds" in the Prospectus;

any transfer taxes and fees and disbursements of counsel
for the Underwriters except as set forth under Section 5
hereof and (iii) and (iv) below) in connection with
(i) the preparation and filing of the Registration State-
ment, each preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, and the printing and
furnishing of copies of each thereof to the Underwriters
and to dealers (including costs of mailing and shipment),

and delivery of the Securities, (iii) the printing of this
Agreement, the Pricing Agreement, an Agreement Among

each thereof to the Underwriters and to dealers (including
costs of mailing and shipment), (iv) the qualification of
the Securities for offering and sale under state laws and
the determination of their eligibility for investment
under state law as aforesaid (including the legal fees and
filing fees and other disbursements of counsel for the
Underwriters) and the printing and furnishing of copies of
any blue sky surveys or legal investment surveys to the
Underwriters and to dealers, (v) any listing of the Secu-
rities on any securities exchange and any registration
thereof under the Exchange Act, (vi) any fees payable to
investment rating agencies with respect to the Securities,

(i) that the Company will not, without the consent
of the Representatives, offer or sell, or publicly an-
nounce its intention to offer or sell, (i) any debt secu-
rities pursuant to a public offering or (ii) any unsecured
debt securities pursuant to a private placement which
contemplates the purchasers of such debt securities re-
ceiving customary registration rights, in each case during
the period beginning on the date of the Pricing Agreement
and ending the 90th day following the date of the Pricing
Agreement. The Company has not taken, and will not take,
directly or indirectly, any action which might reasonably
be expected to cause or result in the stabilization or
manipulation of the price of any security to facilitate
the sale or resale of the Securities.

5. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses: If the
Securities of a series to which the attached Pricing Agreement
relates are not delivered for any reason other than (a) a
termination of the obligations of the several Underwriters in
accordance with clause (a), (c) or (d) of Section 7 hereof, or
(b) a default by one or more of the Underwriters in its or
their respective obligations hereunder, the Company shall
reimburse the Underwriters for all of their out-of-pocket
expenses, including the fees and disbursements of their coun-
sel.

6. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations: The
several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for
the Securities are subject to the accuracy of the representa-

stating that: 

(i) the Pricing Agreement (which incorporates
by reference all the provisions of this Agreement)
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Company; 

(ii) the Indenture has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company, and, assuming

as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally,
and by general principles of equity;

(iii) the Securities have been duly authorized by
the Company and, when executed and authenticated in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and deliv-
ered to and paid for by the Underwriters, will be
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms, except insofar as the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

rights generally, and by general principles of equi-
ty;

(iv) the Securities and the Indenture conform in
all material respects to the summary descriptions
thereof contained in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus;

(v) the Registration Statement and the Prospec-
tus (except as to the financial statements and sched-
ules and other financial and statistical data con-
tained or incorporated by reference therein and the
Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to
which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as
to form in all material respects with the require-
ments of the Act;

tions in which the Securities are being offered by
the Underwriters);

tration Statement and Prospectus were discussed and,
although such counsel has not independently verified, is
not passing upon and does not assume responsibility for,
the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements
contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus
(except as and to the extent stated in subparagraph (iv)
above), no facts have come to the attention of such coun-
sel, in the course of such participation, that causes it

material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus or any

supplement and at all times up to and including the Clos-
ing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

such opinion is limited to United States Federal and New
York law.

at the Closing Date an opinion of David R. Birk, Senior
Vice President and General Counsel for the Company, or
such other counsel to the Company acceptable to the Repre-
sentatives, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the

calamity or crisis of such magnitude in its effect on the
financial markets of the United States as, in the judgment of
the Representatives or in the judgment of such group of Under-
writers, to make it impracticable to market the Securities.

If the Representatives or any group of Underwriters
elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Sec-
tion 7, the Company and each other Underwriter shall be noti-
fied promptly by letter or telegram. 

If the sale to the Underwriters of the Securities, as
contemplated by this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, is
not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted
under this Agreement or if such sale is not carried out because
the Company shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of
this Agreement, the Company shall not be under any obligation
or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provid-
ed in Sections 4(h), 5, 8 and 9 hereof), and the Underwriters
shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company under
this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 8 and
9 hereof) or to one another hereunder.

8. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person,
if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Act as follows:

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim,
damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or
any amendment thereto), including the information deemed
to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule
430A(b) under the Act, if applicable, or the omission or
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue state-
ment or alleged untrue statement of a material fact con-
tained in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim,
damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent
of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litiga-
tion, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmen-
tal agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any
claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or
omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omis-
sion, if such settlement is effected with the written
consent of the Company; and

(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as
incurred (including, subject to Section 8(c) hereof, the
fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Represen-
tatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing
or defending against any litigation, or any investigation
or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, com-
menced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon
any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged
untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such
expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above; provided,
however, that the indemnity provided in this Section 8(a)
shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement
or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made
in reliance upon and in conformity with written informa-
tion furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any
Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use
in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto)
or any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto); provided, further, that
with respect to any untrue statement or omission or al-
leged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary
Prospectus, the indemnity provided in this Section 8(a)
shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from
whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damag-
es, liabilities or expenses purchased the Securities
concerned to the extent that (i) any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense of such Underwriter and its
affiliates results from the fact that a copy of the final
Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or
prior to the written confirmation of sale of such Securi-
ties as required by the Act, and (ii) the untrue statement
or omission has been corrected in the final Prospectus.

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its
officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Act against any and all loss, liability,
claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained
in subsection (a) of this Section 8, as incurred, but only with
respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue
statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or
any amendment thereto) or any preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives
expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amend-
ment thereto) or such preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as
promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party
of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemni-
ty may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indem-
nifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from
any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of
this Section 8. An indemnifying party may participate at its
own expense in the defense of any such action. In no event
shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses
of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel)
separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in
connection with any one action or separate but similar or
related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the
same general allegations or circumstances.

9. Contribution. In order to provide for just and
equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity
provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unen-
forceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in
accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters
shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims,
damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by Section 8
incurred by the Company and one or more of the Underwriters, as
incurred, in such proportions that the Underwriters are respon-
sible for that portion represented by the percentage that the
underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of the
Prospectus or any supplement thereto bears to the initial
public offering price appearing thereon and the Company is
responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepre-
sentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any,
who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such
Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of
the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Act shall have the same rights to contribu-
tion as the Company.

10. Notices: Except as otherwise herein provided,
all statements, requests, notices and agreements shall be in
writing and, if to the Underwriters, at their addresses fur-
nished to the Company in the Pricing Agreement for the purpose
of communications hereunder and, if to the Company, shall be
sufficient in all respects if delivered or telefaxed to the
Company at the offices of the Company at 80 Cutter Mill Road,
Great Neck, New York 11021, Attention: Mr. Raymond Sadowski
(fax no. (516) 466-0349).

11. Construction: This Agreement and the Pricing
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York. The section headings
in this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of convenience
of reference and are not a part of this Agreement. 

12. Parties at Interest: The Agreement herein set
forth and the Pricing Agreement have been and are made solely
for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and the
controlling persons, directors and officers referred to in
Sections 8 and 9 hereof, and their respective successors,
assigns, executors and administrators. No other person,
partnership, association or corporation (including a purchaser,
as such purchaser, from any of the Underwriters) shall acquire
or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or the
Pricing Agreement.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes for the six months ended December 
31, 1993 includes restructuring and integration charges of $22.7 million which are principally 
attributable to the Registrant's acquisition of Hall-Mark. Had such one-time charges not been 
included, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the six months ended December 31, 1993 would 
have been 9.3. 

The Registrant is utilizing the net proceeds from the sale of the Registrant's 6-7/8% 
Notes Due March 15, 2004, to repay outstanding bank borrowings which were incurred to pay part of 
the funding required for the acquisition of Hall-Mark. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 
the six months ended December 31, 1993, giving effect to such repayment would have been 6.1 on a pro 
forma basis. In addition, had the one-time charges referred to in the immediately preceding 
paragraph not been included in income from continuing operations before income taxes, the ratio of 
earnings to fixed charges for the six months ended December 31, 1993 would have been 8.1 on a pro 
forma basis.
