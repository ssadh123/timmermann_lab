Item 5. Other Events.
- ------ ------------

The following information updates certain matters previously reported to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission under Item 1 - Business of Part I of 
the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for 1993 and Part II of the Reports on Form 
10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994, of Public Service Electric and Gas 
Company (PSE&G) and its parent, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated 
(Enterprise). 

Nuclear Operations
- --------------

As previously reported, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1 (Salem 
1) experienced an automatic reactor shutdown on April 7, 1994 due to 
excessive grass from the Delaware River clogging the station's water intake 
structure. Subsequent to the shutdown a precautionary Alert was declared at 
1:16 p.m. and this emergency classification was terminated at 8:20 p.m. No 
abnormal releases of radiation to the environment occurred during the event 
and there was no threat to the public health and safety. Salem 1 remained 
out of service while PSE&G and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
investigated the event and PSE&G implemented remedial actions required to be 
completed prior to returning the unit to service.

On April 7, 1994 the NRC sent an augmented inspection team (AIT) to 
Salem to investigate the event. The AIT completed its on-site investigation 
on April 15, 1994 and presented its preliminary findings at a public meeting 
held at the station site on April 26, 1994. The AIT concluded that the event 
had challenged the reactor coolant system pressure boundary, that operator 
error had occurred which complicated the event, that management had allowed 
equipment problems to exist which made operations difficult for plant 
operators, and that some equipment was degraded by the event, but overall the 
plant performed as designed. The AIT further concluded that operator use of 
emergency operating procedures was good and that investigation and 
trouble-shooting efforts were good. PSE&G's investigation of the event 
resulted in conclusions similar to those of the AIT.

On May 9, 1994, PSE&G and the NRC staff presented their findings to the 
NRC Commissioners, and PSE&G described the actions it had taken to prepare 
Salem 1 for restart. On May 11, 1994, Senator Joseph Biden, representing 
Delaware, wrote to the NRC expressing his concerns regarding early restart of 
the unit and requested assurances "that all outstanding mechanical and 
management problems have been resolved and that a fine in the maximum amount 
will be levied upon the licensee." On May 14, 1994 the NRC authorized the

restart of Salem 1, and the unit initially returned to service on June 4, 
1994. 

PSE&G is continuing to address matters to improve Salem's operations 
identified by itself, the NRC and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations 
(INPO), an independent industry group consisting of utilities, including 
PSE&G, that provides self critical analysis of nuclear operations to member 
utilities. As has been previously reported, actions are being taken to 
improve the plant's material condition, to upgrade procedures and to enhance 
personnel performance, as well as other efforts. However, satisfactory 
operating performance on Salem 1 has not yet been achieved, and the April 7, 
1994 event indicates that to date the corrective actions taken by PSE&G to 
address these long-standing problems have not been fully effective, and that 
material condition deficiencies continue to complicate plant recovery from 
transients which place reliance on operator action to mitigate the 
consequences of the events. 

PSE&G's own assessments, as well as those by the NRC and INPO, indicate 
that additional efforts are required to further improve operating 
performance, and PSE&G is committed to taking the necessary actions to 
address Salem's performance needs. However, no assurance can be given as to 
what, if any, further or additional actions may be taken by PSE&G, or 
required by the NRC, to improve Salem's performance.

Salem Unit 2 and Hope Creek Generating Station, both located adjacent to 
Salem 1 and operated by PSE&G, are presently in operation.
