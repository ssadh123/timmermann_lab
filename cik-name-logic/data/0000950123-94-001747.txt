Annex A
-------

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Stock Acquisition Date or (ii) the close of
business on such day, as may, from time to time, be designated by the Board of
Directors (acting in its sole discretion), that is after the tenth business day
after the date of the commencement of, or first public announcement of the
intent of any Person (other than the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, or
any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
Person organized, appointed or established by the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) to commence (which
intention to commence remains in effect for five business days after such
announcement), a tender or exchange offer if, upon consummation thereof, such
Person would be an Acquiring Person, (the earlier of subsections (i) and (ii)
hereof being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be
evidenced (subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 3) by the
certificates for Common Stock (which certificates for the Common Stock shall be
deemed also to be Rights Certificates) and not by separate Rights Certificates,
and the right to receive Rights Certificates will be transferable only in
connection with the transfer of the Common Stock. As soon as practicable after
the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will send, by first-class, insured,
postage prepaid mail, to each record holder of the Common Stock as of the close
of business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on
the records of the Company, a Rights Certificate, in substantially the form of
Exhibit A attached hereto, evidencing one Right for each share of the Common
Stock so held, subject to adjustment as provided herein. As of and after the
Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Rights
Certificates.

As soon as practicable following the Record Date, the Company
will send a copy of a Summary of Rights, in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage prepaid
mail, to each record holder of the Common Stock as of the close of business on
the Record Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the
Company. With respect to certificates for the Common Stock outstanding as of
the Record Date, until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption, expiration
or termination of the Rights), the Rights will be evidenced by such
certificates for the Common Stock together with the Summary of Rights and the
registered holders of the Common Stock shall also be the registered holders of
the associated Rights. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption,
expiration or termination of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any of
the certificates for the Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date, even
without a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also constitute
the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such
certificate.

PURITAN-BENNETT BOARD APPROVES AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS PLAN
SO THAT RIGHTS DO NOT TRADE SEPARATELY

Overland Park, KS - Puritan-Bennett Corporation (PBEN:NASDAQ) announced at
a meeting held on October 26, 1994, that the Board of Directors approved an
amendment to its Common Stock Purchase Rights Plan providing that separate
trading of Common Stock Purchase Rights shall not occur until such time as the
Board of Directors may, from time to time, determine. If the Board had not
acted, the announcement of the tender offer by Thermo Electron to acquire all
of the outstanding shares of common stock of Puritan-Bennett for $24.50 per
share in cash would have resulted in the issuance of separately traded Rights
Certificates. The Common Stock Purchase Rights are currently transferable only
with the associated common stock. The Rights Plan was adopted by the Board in
May 1989.
Burton A. Dole, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Puritan-Bennett said, "A meeting had been scheduled to consider Thermo
Electron's prior unsolicited proposal to acquire Puritan-Bennett for $24.00 per
share. The Board had not yet considered Thermo Electron's tender offer but
will do so and make a recommendation to stockholders on or before November 7,
1994."
Puritan-Bennett is a world leader in products related to respiration.
These products are used in multiple health care settings and on aircraft.
