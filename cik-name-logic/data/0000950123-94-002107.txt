ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

As previously disclosed, as of October 17, 1994,
the Company, General Electric Company ("GE") and Kidder,
Peabody Group Inc. ("Kidder") entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") and related
documents providing for the Company's purchase of specified
Kidder assets and businesses.

The Company, GE and Kidder have entered into a
Supplemental Agreement dated as of December 9, 1994 (the
"First Supplemental Agreement"), and a Second Supplemental
Agreement dated as of December 16, 1994 (the "Second
Supplemental Agreement"), which, among other things, provide
for the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase
Agreement to be consummated pursuant to multiple closings in
lieu of a single closing.

On December 9, 1994, pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement, as amended and supplemented by the First
Supplemental Agreement, the Company purchased certain assets
of the real estate mortgage business of Kidder, including
Kidder's single family home loan trading, commercial/multi-
family home loan trading, mortgage finance, real estate
finance operations, research and contract finance. The Company,
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries PaineWebber Incorporated 
and Paine Webber Real Estate Securities Inc., acquired 
substantially all the fixed assets of this business (consisting 
primarily of other real estate owned, equipment, furniture 
and fixtures), the accounts receivable of this business and 
selected portions of the inventory of this business from 
Kidder in consideration of a cash payment of approximately 
$580 million and the assumption by the Company of certain
specified liabilities of Kidder arising out of this
business. The Company financed the payment of the purchase
price for these assets through the sale of approximately
$350 million of commercial paper to GE and the balance from
various asset based funding sources.

On December 16, 1994, pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement, as amended and supplemented by the First
Supplemental Agreement and the Second Supplemental
Agreement, the Company purchased certain assets of the
equity research, investment banking (excluding high yield
and emerging markets), fixed income (sales force only),
international institutional equity, international fixed
income, listed domestic futures and short term finance
businesses of Kidder (the "Other Acquired Businesses"). The

<PAGE> 3

3

Company acquired substantially all the fixed assets of the 
Other Acquired Businesses (consisting primarily of equipment, 
furniture and fixtures) and the accounts receivable of the 
Other Acquired Businesses. In addition, the Company assumed 
specified liabilities of Kidder arising out of the Other 
Acquired Businesses. In consideration for these assets, the 
Company issued to Kidder (i) 21.5 million shares of Common
Stock of the Company, (ii) $100 million stated value of 6% 
Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series A, of 
the Company (the "Convertible Preferred Stock") and (iii) $250 
million stated value of 9% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, 
Series C, of the Company (the "Redeemable Preferred Stock"). 
The Company financed the cash portion of the purchase price 
through available internal funds.

The Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemable at
any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company
at redemption prices declining to $100 per share, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends, by December 16, 2004. The
Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory
redemption on December 15, 2014. The Convertible Preferred
Stock is convertible into shares of Common Stock, at any
time, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder at a
conversion price of $18.13 per share of Common Stock,
subject to adjustment. However, until the stockholders of
the Company approve the issuance of the Common Stock to be
delivered upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred
Stock, the Convertible Preferred Stock is not convertible
into shares of Common Stock and the Company is obligated to
deliver cash in lieu of Common Stock upon any exercise of
the conversion privilege.

The Redeemable Preferred Stock is redeemable at
any time after December 15, 1999, in whole or in part, at
the option of the Company at a price of $100 per share,
together with accrued but unpaid dividends. The Redeemable
Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory redemption on
December 15, 2014.

The foregoing summary of the terms of the
Convertible Preferred Stock and the Redeemable Preferred
Stock is qualified by reference to the respective
Certificates of Designation, copies of which are attached as
Exhibit 3.1 and 3.2.

As a result of these transactions, GE now owns
approximately 25% of the Common Stock of the Company on a
fully diluted basis. Pursuant to a Stockholders Agreement
dated as of December 16, 1994, among the Company, GE and
Kidder (the "Stockholders Agreement"), GE has agreed to
certain "standstill" arrangements, which will continue until
the earlier of (i) December 16, 2009, and (ii) three years
after GE sells all its voting securities of the Company.
GE's ability to transfer the Company's Common Stock and
Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to various
restrictions. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, GE is
entitled to nominate one director for election to the
Company's Board of Directors for so long as GE holds at
least 10% of the total voting power of the Company. A copy
of the Stockholders Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4.1.

In connection with the purchase of the Other
Acquired Businesses, the Company and Kidder and certain of
their affiliates entered into a series of securities trades
pursuant to which (i) the Company sold to Kidder for cash
approximately $267 million in fair market value of U.S.
Treasury securities and (ii) Kidder sold to the Company for
cash approximately $617 million in fair market value of
commercial paper, adjustable-rate preferred stock, short-
term certificates of deposit and Eurobond securities.

The acquisition by the Company of the assets of
the retail brokerage business of Kidder is currently
expected to occur on or about January 30, 1995, and the
acquisition by the Company of the assets of the asset
management business of Kidder is currently expected to occur
no later than April 30, 1995, following the receipt of certain 
consents and approvals.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

(a), (b) Neither audited nor unaudited financial
statements are currently available for the assets and
businesses acquired by the Company on December 9, 1994, and
December 16, 1994. Accordingly, it is not practicable to
provide the historical or pro forma financial statements
required by Item 7 of Form 8-K at the time this Current
Report on Form 8-K is filed. The Company shall file the
required historical and pro forma financial statements as
soon as they are available, but in no event later than
the time provided for under the applicable rules.

PAINE WEBBER GROUP INC.

Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware

The undersigned, Theodore A. Levine, Vice President, of Paine
Webber Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the
"CORPORATION"), pursuant to the provisions of Sections 103 and 151 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, does hereby make this
Certificate of Designations and does hereby state and certify that pursuant to
the authority expressly vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation by
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION"), the Board of Directors duly adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED, that, pursuant to Article IV of the Certificate of
Incorporation (which authorizes 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $20 par
value ("PREFERRED STOCK"), of which (i) up to 2,200,000 shares of a series of
7.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) 240,000 shares of a series of 7.5%
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B and (iii) up to 2,200,000 shares of a
series of 6% Convertible Preferred Stock have been authorized for issuance, the
Board of Directors hereby fixes the powers, designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions, of a series of Preferred Stock
(in addition to the powers, designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation which are applicable to such series of Preferred Stock).
<PAGE> 2
2

RESOLVED, that each share of such series of Preferred Stock
shall rank equally in all respects and shall be subject to the following
provisions:

(1) Number and Designation. 1,000,000 shares of the
Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall be designated as 6% Cumulative
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series A (the "SERIES A CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK").

(2) Rank. The shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
shall rank prior to the shares of the Corporation's common stock, $1 par value
(the "COMMON STOCK"), and any other class of stock of the Corporation ranking
junior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (whether with respect to
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise). All
equity securities of the Corporation to which the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock ranks prior (whether with respect to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise), including the Common Stock,
are collectively referred to herein as the "JUNIOR SECURITIES." All equity
securities of the Corporation with which the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock ranks on a parity (whether with respect to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution, winding up or otherwise), including the Corporation's 7.5%
Convertible Preferred Stock, 7.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, 6%
Convertible Preferred Stock and 9% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock,
Series C, are collectively referred to herein as the "PARITY SECURITIES." The
respective definitions of Junior Securities and Parity Securities shall also
include any rights or options exercisable for or convertible into any of the
Junior Securities and Parity Securities, as the case may be.

(3) Dividends. (a) The holders of shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if
declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the
payment of dividends, cash dividends at the annual rate of $6 per share. Such
dividends shall be payable in arrears in equal amounts quarterly on March 15,
June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year (unless such day is not a
Business Day, in which event on the next succeeding Business Day) (each of such
dates being a "DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE" and each such quarterly period being a
"DIVIDEND PERIOD") commencing on the Dividend Payment Date which next follows
the issuance of such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Such
dividends (i) shall be cumulative from the date of issue,
<PAGE> 3
3

whether or not declared and whether or not in any Dividend Period or Periods
there shall be funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of
such dividends and (ii) shall compound quarterly, to the extent they are
unpaid, at the rate of 6% per annum computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
twelve 30-day months. Each such dividend shall be payable to the holders of
record of shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as they appear on
the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on such record
dates, not more than 60 days, or less than 10 days, preceding the payment dates
thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized
committee thereof. Accrued and unpaid dividends for any past Dividend Periods
may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any Dividend Payment
Date, to holders of record on such date, not more than 45 days preceding the
payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. As used
herein, the term "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a Saturday,
Sunday, a day on which the New York Stock Exchange does not conduct regular
trading or a day on which is or is declared a national or New York State
holiday.

(b) The amount of dividends payable for each full Dividend
Period for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed by
dividing the annual dividend rate by four. The amount of dividends payable for
the initial Dividend Period, or any other period shorter or longer than a full
Dividend Period, on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be computed
on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. Holders of shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends,
whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of cumulative dividends,
as herein provided, on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

(c) So long as any shares of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividends, except as described in the next
succeeding sentence, shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on
Parity Securities, for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or
contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for
the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock for all Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the date of
payment of the dividend on such class or series of parity stock. When
dividends are not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set
apart, as aforesaid, all dividends declared upon shares of the Series
<PAGE> 4
4

A Convertible Preferred Stock and all dividends declared upon any other Parity
Security shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of
dividends accumulated and unpaid on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
and accumulated and unpaid on such Parity Security.

(d) So long as any shares of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividends (other than dividends or
distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe
for or purchase shares of, Junior Securities) shall be declared or paid or set
apart for payment or other distribution declared or made upon Junior
Securities, nor shall any Junior Securities be redeemed, purchased or otherwise
acquired (all such dividends, distributions, redemptions or purchases being
hereinafter referred to as a "JUNIOR SECURITIES DISTRIBUTION") for any
consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund
for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation,
directly or indirectly (except by conversion into or exchange for Junior
Securities), unless in each case (i) the full cumulative dividends on all
outstanding shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and any other
Parity Securities shall have been paid or set apart for payment for all past
Dividend Periods with respect to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and
all past dividend periods with respect to such Parity Securities and (ii)
sufficient funds shall have been paid or set apart for the payment of the
dividend for the current Dividend Period with respect to the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock and the current dividend period with respect to
such Parity Securities.

(4) Liquidation Preference. (a) In the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the
Corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the
holders of Junior Securities, the holders of the shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive $100 per share of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or
not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final
distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any
further payment. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the assets of the Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable
among the holders of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall
be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount
<PAGE> 5
5

aforesaid and liquidating payments on any Parity Securities, then such assets,
or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and any such other Parity Securities
ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and any such other stock if all
amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this paragraph
(4), a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Corporation's
assets, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
voluntary or involuntary, of the Corporation, but a consolidation or merger of
the Corporation with one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the
Corporation.

(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of any Parity
Securities, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as provided in this paragraph (4), any
other series or class or classes of Junior Securities shall, subject to the
respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to
receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders
of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share
therein.

(5) Redemption. (a) To the extent the Corporation shall
have funds legally available for such payment, at any time or from time to time
prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance of the shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation may redeem at its option, in
whole or in part, shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a
redemption price per share in cash equal to the greater of (i) $140 and (ii)
the average of (A) $140 and (B) the Current Market Price Per Common Share (as
defined in paragraph (7)(g)(vi)) as of the date of notice of redemption
multiplied by the number obtained by dividing 100 by the Conversion Price (as
defined in paragraph 7(a)) then in effect, in each case, together with any
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date.

(b) To the extent the Corporation shall have funds legally
available for such payment, at any time or from time to time on or after the
fifth anniversary of the date of issuance of the shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, the Corporation may redeem at its option, in whole or in part,
shares of Series A Convertible
<PAGE> 6
6

Preferred Stock at a redemption price in cash (subject to subparagraph (d)
below) equal to the sum of (i) the redemption price per share indicated below
and (ii) any accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date. The amount
of the redemption price per share, if redeemed during the 12-month period
commencing on the December 16th of the years indicated below, is:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Year Amount
---- ------
<S> <C>
1999 $105
2000 $104
2001 $103
2002 $102
2003 $101
2004 and thereafter $100
</TABLE>

(c) To the extent the Corporation shall have funds legally
available for such payment, on December 15, 2014, if any shares of the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall redeem
all outstanding shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, at a
redemption price of $100 per share in cash (subject to paragraph (d) below)
together with accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to such date.

(d) In lieu of a cash payment of the redemption price per
share due upon any redemption of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
pursuant to paragraph 5(b) or (c), the Corporation may issue shares of Common
Stock to the holders of record of such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock in full payment of such amount, by giving written notice (in the manner
described in paragraph (6)) to such holders. If such notice is so given, the
Corporation shall issue and deliver or cause to be delivered to each such
holder of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock being redeemed out of
its authorized but unissued Common Stock or Common Stock held in treasury that
number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the aggregate
redemption price payable in respect of all such shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock owned by such holder being redeemed by the Current Market Price
Per Common Share as of the redemption date. The Corporation shall, in lieu of
issuing any fractional shares of Common Stock to any such holder, pay to such
holder cash in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the
Current Market Price Per Common Share as of the redemption date.
<PAGE> 7
7

(e) Immediately prior to authorizing or making any redemption
pursuant to this paragraph (5), the Corporation, by resolution of its Board of
Directors, shall, to the extent of any funds legally available therefor,
declare a dividend on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock payable on the
redemption date in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as of such redemption date.

(f) If the Corporation is unable or shall fail to discharge
its obligation to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph (5)(c) (the "MANDATORY REDEMPTION
OBLIGATION"), the Mandatory Redemption Obligation shall be discharged as soon
as the Corporation is able to discharge such Mandatory Redemption Obligation.
If and so long as any Mandatory Redemption Obligation with respect to the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be fully discharged, the
Corporation shall not (i) directly or indirectly, redeem, purchase, or
otherwise acquire any Parity Security or discharge any mandatory or optional
redemption, sinking fund or other similar obligation in respect of any Parity
Securities (except in connection with a redemption, sinking fund or other
similar obligation to be satisfied pro rata with the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock) or (ii) in accordance with paragraph (3)(d), declare or make
any Junior Securities Distribution, or, directly or indirectly, discharge any
mandatory or optional redemption, sinking fund or other similar obligation in
respect of the Junior Securities.

(g) Shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which have
been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or
redeemed, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of
the State of Delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the
class of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series and may be redesignated and
reissued as part of any series of the Preferred Stock; provided that no such
issued and reacquired shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be
reissued or sold as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

(6) Procedure for Redemption. (a) In the event that fewer
than all the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are to
be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the
Board of Directors and the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata
(with any fractional shares being rounded to the
<PAGE> 8
8

nearest whole share) as nearly as practicable or by lot, or by such other
method as the Board of Directors may determine to be equitable.

(b) In the event the Corporation shall redeem shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, notice of such redemption shall be given
by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 days nor more
than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the
shares to be redeemed at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock
register of the Corporation; provided that neither the failure to give such
notice nor any defect therein shall affect the validity of the giving of notice
for the redemption of any share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be
redeemed except as to the holder to whom the Corporation has failed to give
said notice or except as to the holder whose notice was defective. Each such
notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the
shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be
redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places
where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the
redemption price; (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to
accrue on such redemption date; and (vi) whether the redemption price will be
paid in cash or shares of Common Stock.

(c) Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after
the redemption date (unless default shall be made by the Corporation in
providing money for the payment of the redemption price of the shares called
for redemption), dividends on the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the
holders thereof as stockholders of the Corporation (except the right to receive
from the Corporation the redemption price) shall cease. Upon surrender in
accordance with said notice of the certificates for the shares so redeemed
(properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the
Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall
be redeemed by the Corporation at the redemption price aforesaid. In case
fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a
new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost
to the holder thereof.

(d) All shares of Common Stock delivered pursuant
<PAGE> 9
9

to this paragraph (6) will upon delivery be duly and validly issued and fully
paid and nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to any
preemptive rights, and free from all documentary, stamp, transfer or other
similar taxes. If the shares of Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to this
paragraph (6) are to be issued in the name of a person other than the
registered holder of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock being
redeemed, such registered holder shall pay all transfer or other similar taxes
with respect thereto.

(7) Conversion. (a)(i) Subject to the provisions of this
paragraph (7), the holders of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, at such holder's
option, to convert any or all outstanding shares (and fractional shares) of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into that number of
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (calculated as to each
conversion to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share) obtained by dividing 100 by
the Conversion Price (as defined below), and by surrender of such shares so to
be converted, such surrender to be made in the manner provided in this
paragraph (7). The term "Conversion Price" shall mean $18.13 per share, as
adjusted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7(g).

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the right
to convert shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption
pursuant to paragraph (5) shall terminate (A) if the date of redemption is
prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance of the shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock, at the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the date on which the Corporation gives a notice of redemption with
respect to such shares in accordance with paragraph (6) and (B) if the date of
redemption is on or after the fifth anniversary of such date of issuance, at
the close of business on the day immediately preceding the redemption date, in
each case, unless the Corporation shall default in making payment of the amount
payable upon such redemption.

(b)(i) In order to exercise the conversion privilege, the
holder of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted
shall surrender the certificate representing such shares at the office of the
Corporation, or at the office of the conversion agent for the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock appointed for such purpose by the Corporation, with
a written notice of

Denominations: 
-----------------------

Unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as
the name in which such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are
registered, each share surrendered for conversion shall be accompanied by
instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed
by the holder or the holder's duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient
to pay any transfer or similar tax.

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the surrender by the holder
of the certificates for shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as
aforesaid, the Corporation shall issue and shall deliver to such holder, or on
the holder's written order to the holder's transferee, a certificate or
certificates for the whole number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of such shares in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph
(7) and any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising
upon such conversion shall be settled as provided in paragraph (7)(f).

(iii) Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected
immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the
certificates for shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall have been
surrendered and such notice received by the Corporation as aforesaid, and the
person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have
become the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby
at such time on such date. All shares of Common Stock delivered upon
conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will upon delivery be
duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable, free of all liens
and charges and not subject to any preemptive rights. Upon the surrender of
certificates representing shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, such
shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of a holder
with respect to such shares surrendered for conversion shall immediately
terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock and other amounts
payable pursuant to this paragraph (7).

(c)(i) Subject to paragraph (7)(a)(ii), upon delivery to the
Corporation by a holder of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of a
notice of election to
<PAGE> 12
12

convert, the right of the Corporation to redeem such shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock shall terminate.

(ii) Subject to paragraph (7)(a)(ii), from the date of delivery
by a holder of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of such notice of
election to convert, in lieu of dividends on such Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph (3), such Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock shall participate equally and ratably with the holders of shares of
Common Stock in all dividends paid on the Common Stock as if such shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted to shares of Common
Stock at the time of such delivery.

(iii) If, after receipt by a holder of shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock of a notice of redemption pursuant to paragraph (5)
with a redemption date for such shares on or after the fifth anniversary of the
issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, such holder delivers to
the Corporation a notice of election to convert, such Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue dividends pursuant to paragraph (3) but
such shares shall continue to be entitled to receive all accrued dividends
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to paragraph (3) through the
date of delivery of such notice of election to convert (including pro rata
dividends for the period from the last Dividend Payment Date to the date of
delivery of the notice of election to convert) in preference to and in priority
over any dividends on the Common Stock. Such accrued dividends shall be
payable to such holder when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out
of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, as provided in
paragraph (3) above.

(iv) Except as provided above and in paragraph (7)(g), the
Corporation shall make no payment or adjustment for accrued and unpaid
dividends on shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, whether or not in
arrears, on conversion of such shares or for dividends in cash on the shares of
Common Stock issued upon such conversion.

(d)(i) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times
reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, such number of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as shall be required for the
purpose of effecting conversions of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(i), the number of shares of Common Stock
which shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of
Series A Convertible
<PAGE> 13
13

Preferred Stock shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such
outstanding shares were held by a single holder.

(ii) Prior to the delivery of any securities which the
Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to
comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations which require
action to be taken by the Corporation.

(e) The Corporation will pay any and all documentary stamp or
similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of
shares of Common Stock on conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock pursuant hereto; provided that the Corporation shall not be required to
pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the
holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted and no such
issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such
issue or delivery has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has
established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been
paid.

(f) In connection with the conversion of any shares of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be
issued, but in lieu thereof the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in
respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional
interest multiplied by the Current Market Price Per Common Share on the
Business Day on which such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are
deemed to have been converted. If more than one share shall be surrendered for
conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock so
surrendered. All calculations under this paragraph (7) shall be made to the
nearest 1/100 of one cent or to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share, as the case
may be.

(g) The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time
as follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time after the date
of issue of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (I) declare a dividend or
make a
<PAGE> 14
14

distribution on Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (II) subdivide or split
the outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (III) combine or
reclassify the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, (IV)
issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of Common Stock
(including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or
merger in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation), or (V)
consolidate with, or merge with or into, any other Person (unless the
Corporation shall be the surviving corporation in such merger and the holders
of Common Stock of the Corporation are not entitled to receive any
consideration in connection therewith), the Conversion Price in effect at the
time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or of the effective
date of such subdivision, split, combination, consolidation, merger or
reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of
the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock after such time shall entitle the
holder to receive the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock or other
securities of the Corporation (or shares of any security into which such shares
of Common Stock have been combined, consolidated, merged or reclassified
pursuant to clause (III), (IV) or (V) above) which, if this Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted immediately prior to such time,
such holder would have owned upon such conversion and been entitled to receive
by virtue of such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination,
consolidation, merger or reclassification, assuming such holder of Common Stock
of the Corporation (x) is not a Person with which the Corporation consolidated
or into which the Corporation merged or which merged into the Corporation or to
which such recapitalization, sale or transfer was made, as the case may be
("CONSTITUENT PERSON"), or an affiliate of a constituent person and (y) failed
to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash
and other property receivable upon such reclassification, change,
consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or transfer (provided, that if
the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such
reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or
transfer is not the same for each share of Common Stock of the Corporation held
immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger,
recapitalization, sale or transfer by other than a constituent person or an
affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not
have been exercised ("NON-ELECTING SHARE"), then for the purpose of this
paragraph (g) (i) the kind and
<PAGE> 15
15

amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such
reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, recapitalization, sale or
transfer by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount
so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). Such
adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall
occur.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall issue or sell any Common
Stock (other than Excluded Stock (as defined below)) without consideration or
for a consideration per share less than the then Current Market Price Per
Common Share, the Conversion Price to be in effect after such issuance or sale
shall be determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such issuance or sale by a fraction of which the numerator shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance or sale plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price
of the total number of shares so issued or sold would purchase at such Current
Market Price Per Common Share, and of which the denominator shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
issuance or sale. In case any portion of the consideration to be received by
the Corporation shall be in a form other than cash, the fair market value of
such noncash consideration shall be utilized in the foregoing computation.
Such fair market value shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Such adjustment shall be made effective immediately after such
issuance or sale. For purposes of paragraphs (g)(ii), (iii) and (iv),
"Excluded Stock" shall mean any shares of Common Stock, or any shares of stock
or other securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable for shares
of Common Stock (such convertible, exercisable or exchangeable stock or
securities being herein called "CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES") or any rights to
subscribe for or purchase, or options or warrants for the purchase of shares of
the Common Stock or any Convertible Securities issued, granted or sold (I) as
payment of all or any portion of the cost of acquiring assets or stock or
securities of any other corporation or of assets of or interests in any
noncorporate entity or in any other transaction (other than a distribution
without consideration to holders of the then outstanding shares of Common
Stock) in which the consideration for such shares of the Common Stock,
Convertible Securities or rights or options is other than cash, obligations of
the United States Government or Federal funds; (II) pursuant to any employee
plan or employee contract approved or otherwise authorized by the Board of
<PAGE> 16
16

Directors of the Corporation, including without limitation, any employee stock
option plan, employee restricted stock plan or other employee incentive plan or
any share purchase plan; (III) pursuant to any shareholder dividend
reinvestment plan; (IV) upon the conversion or exchange of any Convertible
Securities outstanding on December 16, 1994 or the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, or pursuant to any other contractual obligation in existence
on such date or any Convertible Securities issued after such date provided that
the "conversion price" for the Common Stock underlying such Convertible
Security is greater than the Current Market Price Per Common Share on the date
such Convertible Security is issued, granted or sold; (V) upon the conversion
or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the exercise of any rights or
options, in either case, issued, granted or sold in the circumstances described
in any of the foregoing clauses (I) through (IV) or upon the conversion or
exchange of Convertible Securities acquired upon the exercise of any such
rights or options; or (VI) pursuant to the exercise of any rights or options,
or upon conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities, if with respect
to such rights, options or Convertible Securities no adjustment to the
Conversion Price was required pursuant to this paragraph (g)(ii).

(iii) In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the
issue (other than pursuant to an automatic dividend reinvestment plan of the
Corporation or any similar plan or any customary shareholders rights plan of
the Corporation) of rights, options or warrants (other than Excluded Stock) to
the holders of its Common Stock or other securities entitling such holders to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible
into shares of Common Stock) at a price per share of Common Stock (or having a
conversion price per share of Common Stock, if a security convertible into
shares of Common Stock) less than the then Current Market Price Per Common
Share on such record date, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants (or conversion of
such convertible securities) shall be deemed to have been issued and
outstanding as of such record date, and the Conversion Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to paragraph (g)(ii) hereof as though such maximum number of shares of
Common Stock had been so issued for an aggregate consideration equal to the
aggregate consideration payable for such rights, options, warrants or
convertible securities and the aggregate consideration payable by the holders
of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities prior to their
receipt of such shares of Common
<PAGE> 17
17

Stock. In case any portion of such consideration shall be in a form other than
cash, the fair market value of such noncash consideration shall be determined
as set forth in paragraph (g)(ii) hereof. Such adjustment shall be made
effective on the day immediately after the record date; and in the event that
such rights, options or warrants are not so issued or expire unexercised or
such convertible securities are redeemed or otherwise retired prior to
conversion thereof, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of
Common Stock to which the holders of such rights, options, warrants or
convertible securities are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment
provisions therein comparable to those contained in this paragraph (g)), the
Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would
then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed, in the former event,
or the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such holders had
initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of Common Stock, in
the latter event.

(iv) In case the Corporation shall issue rights, options or
warrants (other than Excluded Stock) entitling the holders thereof to subscribe
for or purchase Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of Common
Stock) or shall issue convertible securities, at a price per share of Common
Stock (or having a conversion price per share of Common Stock, if a security
convertible into shares of Common Stock) (including, in the case of rights,
options or warrants, the price at which they may be exercised) is less than the
then Current Market Price Per Common Share, the maximum number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants or upon
conversion of such convertible securities shall be deemed to have been issued
and outstanding as of the date of such sale or issuance, and the Conversion
Price shall be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (g)(ii) hereof as though such
maximum number of shares of Common Stock had been so issued for an aggregate
consideration equal to the aggregate consideration paid for such rights,
options, warrants or convertible securities and the aggregate consideration
payable by the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible
securities prior to their receipt of such shares of Common Stock. In case any
portion of such consideration shall be in a form other than cash, the fair
market value of such noncash consideration shall be determined as set forth in
paragraph (g)(ii) hereof. Such adjustment shall be made effective immediately
after such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities are issued; and
in the event that such rights, options or warrants expire unexercised or such
<PAGE> 18
18

convertible securities are redeemed or otherwise retired prior to conversion
thereof, or in the event of a change in the number of shares of Common Stock to
which the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible securities
are entitled (other than pursuant to adjustment provisions therein comparable
to those contained in this paragraph (g)), the Conversion Price shall again be
adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such
rights, options, warrants or convertible securities had not been issued, in the
former event, or the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such
holders had initially been entitled to such changed number of shares of Common
Stock, in the latter event. No adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be
made pursuant to this paragraph (g)(iv) to the extent that the Conversion Price
shall have been adjusted pursuant to paragraph (g)(iii) upon the setting of any
record date relating to such rights, options, warrants or convertible
securities and such adjustment fully reflects the number of shares of Common
Stock to which the holders of such rights, options, warrants or convertible
securities are entitled and the price payable therefor.

(v) In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the
making of a distribution to holders of Common Stock (including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the continuing corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, assets
or other property (other than regular periodic cash dividends or dividends
payable in Common Stock or rights, options or warrants referred to in, and for
which an adjustment is made pursuant to, paragraph (g)(iii) hereof), the
Conversion Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such record
date by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market
Price Per Common Share on such record date, less the fair market value
(determined as set forth in paragraph (g)(ii) hereof) of the portion of the
assets, other property or evidence of indebtedness so to be distributed which
is applicable to one share of Common Stock and (B) the denominator of which
shall be the Current Market Price Per Common Share on such record date. Such
adjustments shall be made effective on the day immediately after the record
date; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion
Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in
effect if such record date had not been fixed.

(vi) On any date, the "CURRENT MARKET PRICE PER COMMON SHARE"
shall be deemed to be the average of the Daily
<PAGE> 19
19

Prices (as defined below) per share of the applicable class of Common Stock for
the ten consecutive trading days immediately prior to such date. "DAILY PRICE"
means (1) if the shares of such class of Common Stock then are listed and
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"), the closing price on such
day as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape; (2) if the shares of
such class of Common Stock then are not listed and traded on the NYSE, the
closing price on such day as reported by the principal national securities
exchange on which the shares are listed and traded; (3) if the shares of such
class of Common Stock then are not listed and traded on any such securities
exchange, the last reported sale price on such day on the National Market of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System
("NASDAQ"); or (4) if the shares of such class of Common Stock then are not
traded on the NASDAQ National Market, the average of the highest reported bid
and lowest reported asked price on such day as reported by NASDAQ. "TRADING
DAY" means, with respect to any exchange or market, each Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, other than any day on which securities are not
traded on such exchange or in such market. For purposes of any computation
under this paragraph (g), the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of
the Corporation.

(vii) To the extent that the Conversion Price shall have been
adjusted pursuant to any of paragraph (g)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) as a result
of a particular event, no additional adjustment shall be made pursuant to any
other of such paragraphs (g)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) as a result of such event.
No adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to paragraphs (g)(ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v) above shall be required unless such adjustment would require an
increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Conversion Price; provided that any
adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (g)(vii) are not required to be
made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment. All calculations under this paragraph (g) shall be made to the
nearest four decimal points.

(viii) In the event that, at any time as a result of the
provisions of this paragraph (g), the holder of this Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock upon subsequent conversion shall become entitled to receive any
shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than Common Stock, the number
of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of this Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock
<PAGE> 20
20

shall thereafter be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on
terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions contained herein.

(h) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to
this paragraph (7), (i) the Corporation shall promptly file with the conversion
agent a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants (who may be the
regular accountants employed by the Corporation) setting forth the Conversion
Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts
requiring such adjustment and the manner of computing the same, and (ii) a
notice stating that the Conversion Price has been adjusted and setting forth
the adjusted Conversion Price shall promptly be sent by first class mail,
postage prepaid, by the Corporation to the holders of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock at their addresses as the same appear on the stock register of
the Corporation.

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph (7), to
the extent the Corporation shall have funds legally available for such purpose,
the Corporation shall have the option, upon receipt from any holder of notice
of election to convert shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant
to paragraph (7)(b), to deliver, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock into
which such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would otherwise be
convertible, cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) such number of
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock would otherwise be convertible multiplied by (B) the Current Market Price
Per Common Share, together with all accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock; provided that (i) if the Corporation
has not received any required approval under the 1986 Supplement to The Banking
Act of 1948 of New Jersey, 17 N.J. Stat. Ann. Section 376 et seq., concerning
the change of control of banks, or (ii) if the shareholders of the Corporation
have not voted to approve the issuance of the Common Stock required to be
delivered upon a conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, in
each case, the Corporation shall have the obligation to deliver cash pursuant
to this paragraph (7)(i) upon any exercise of the conversion privilege.

(8) Voting Rights. (a) The holders of record of shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights
except as hereinafter provided in this paragraph (8) or as otherwise provided
by law.
<PAGE> 21
21

(b) If and whenever six quarterly dividends (whether or not
consecutive) payable on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have not been
paid in full or if the Corporation shall have failed to discharge its Mandatory
Redemption Obligation, the number of directors then constituting the Board of
Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock, together with the holders of shares of every other
series of preferred stock upon which like rights to vote for the election of
two additional directors have been conferred and are exercisable (resulting
from either the failure to pay dividends or the failure to redeem)(any such
other series is referred to as the "PREFERRED SHARES"), voting as a single
class regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional
directors to serve on the Board of Directors at any annual meeting of
stockholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting
of the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Preferred
Shares called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on
the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares then
outstanding shall have been paid and dividends thereon shall have been paid
regularly for at least one year, or the Corporation shall have fulfilled its
Mandatory Redemption Obligation, as the case may be, then the right of the
holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares to
elect such additional two directors shall cease (but subject always to the same
provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar
future arrearages in six quarterly dividends or failure to fulfill any
Mandatory Redemption Obligation), and the terms of office of all persons
elected as directors by the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
and the Preferred Shares shall forthwith terminate and the number of the Board
of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power
shall have been so vested in the holders of shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares, the secretary of the Corporation may,
and upon the written request of any holder of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock (addressed to the secretary at the principal office of the Corporation)
shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock and of the Preferred Shares for the election of the two
directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by
notice similar to that provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation for a special
meeting of the stockholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting
required to be called as above provided shall not be called by the secretary
within 20 days after
<PAGE> 22
22

receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for
that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation. The
directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next
annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof if
such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. If any
vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares, a successor shall be
elected by the Board of Directors, upon the nomination of the then-remaining
director elected by the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and
the Preferred Shares or the successor of such remaining director, to serve
until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting held in
place thereof if such office shall not have previously terminated as provided
above.

(c) Without the written consent of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or the vote of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock at a meeting of the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock called for such purpose, the Corporation will not (i) amend, alter or
repeal any provision hereof or of the Certificate of Incorporation (by merger
or otherwise) so as to affect the preferences, rights or powers of the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock; provided that any such amendment that changes the
dividend payable on or the liquidation preference of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock shall require the affirmative vote at a meeting of holders of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock called for such purpose or written consent
of the holder of each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock; or (ii)
create any class or classes of stock ranking equal or prior to the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up or increase the number of authorized number of shares
of any class or classes of stock ranking equal or prior to the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent of the
holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be required for (i)
the creation of any indebtedness of any kind of the Corporation, (ii) the
creation of any class of Junior Securities or (iii) any increase or decrease in
the amount of authorized Common Stock or any increase, decrease or change in
the par value thereof or in any other terms thereof.
<PAGE> 23
23

(d) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this
paragraph (8), each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall have
one vote per share, except that when any other series of preferred stock shall
have the right to vote with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as a
single class on any matter, then the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and
such other series shall have with respect to such matters one vote per $100 of
stated liquidation preference. Except as set forth herein, the shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not have any relative,
participating, optional or other special voting rights and powers and the
consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any
corporate action.

(9) Stockholders Agreement. The Series A Convertible 
Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of the Stockholders 
Agreement among the Corporation, Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. and General 
Electric Company dated December 16, 1994.

(10) General Provisions. (a) The term "PERSON" as used herein
means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust,
organization, association, other entity or individual.

(b) The term "OUTSTANDING", when used with reference to
shares of stock, shall mean issued shares, excluding shares held by the
Corporation (including treasury shares) or a subsidiary.

(c) The headings of the paragraphs of this Certificate of
Designations are for convenience of reference only and shall not define, limit
or affect any of the provisions hereof.

Webber Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the
"CORPORATION"), pursuant to the provisions of Sections 103 and 151 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, does hereby make this
Certificate of Designations and does hereby state and certify that pursuant to
the authority expressly vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation by
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION"), the Board of Directors duly adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED, that, pursuant to Article IV of the Certificate of
Incorporation (which authorizes 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $20 par
value ("PREFERRED STOCK"), of which (i) up to 2,200,000 shares of a series of
7.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) 240,000 shares of a series of 7.5%
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B and (iii) up to 2,200,000 shares of a
series of 6% Convertible Preferred Stock have been authorized for issuance, the
Board of Directors hereby fixes the powers, designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions, of a series of Preferred Stock
(in addition to the powers, designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation which are applicable to such series of Preferred Stock).
<PAGE> 2

RESOLVED, that each share of such series of Preferred Stock
shall rank equally in all respects and shall be subject to the following
provisions:

(1) Number and Designation. 2,500,000 shares of the
Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall be designated as 9% Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series C (the "SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK").

(2) Rank. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall rank
prior to the shares of the Corporation's common stock, $1 par value (the
"COMMON STOCK"), and any other class of stock of the Corporation ranking junior
to the Series C Preferred Stock (whether with respect to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise). All equity securities of
the Corporation to which the Series C Preferred Stock ranks prior (whether with
respect to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, winding up or
otherwise), including the Common Stock, are collectively referred to herein as
the "JUNIOR SECURITIES." All equity securities of the Corporation with which
the Series C Preferred Stock ranks on a parity (whether with respect to
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise),
including the Corporation's 7.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, 7.5% Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series B, 6% Convertible Preferred Stock and 6% Cumulative
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series A, are collectively referred to
herein as the "PARITY SECURITIES." The respective definitions of Junior
Securities and Parity Securities shall also include any rights or options
exercisable for or convertible into any of the Junior Securities and Parity
Securities, as the case may be.

(3) Dividends. (a) The holders of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of
dividends, cash dividends at the annual rate of $9 per share. Such dividends
shall be payable in arrears in equal amounts quarterly on March 15, June 15,
September 15 and December 15 of each year (unless such day is not a Business
Day, in which event on the next succeeding Business Day) (each of such dates
being a "DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE" and each such quarterly period being a
"DIVIDEND PERIOD") commencing on the Dividend Payment Date which next follows
the issuance of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Such dividends (i)
shall be cumulative from the date of issue, whether or not declared and whether
or not in any Dividend Period or Periods there shall be funds of the
Corporation legally
<PAGE> 3
3

available for the payment of such dividends and (ii) shall compound quarterly,
to the extent they are unpaid, at the rate of 9% per annum computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and twelve 30-day months. Each such dividend shall be
payable to the holders of record of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, as
they appear on the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on
such record dates, not more than 60 days, or less than 10 days, preceding the
payment dates thereof, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof. Accrued and unpaid dividends for any past
Dividend Periods may be declared and paid at any time, without reference to any
Dividend Payment Date, to holders of record on such date, not more than 45 days
preceding the payment date thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.
As used herein, the term "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday, a day on which the New York Stock Exchange does not conduct
regular trading or a day on which is or is declared a national or New York
State holiday.

(b) The amount of dividends payable for each full Dividend
Period for the Series C Preferred Stock shall be computed by dividing the
annual dividend rate by four. The amount of dividends payable for the initial
Dividend Period, or any other period shorter or longer than a full Dividend
Period, on the Series C Preferred Stock shall be computed on the basis of
twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. Holders of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in
cash, property or stock, in excess of cumulative dividends, as herein provided,
on the Series C Preferred Stock.

(c) So long as any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are
outstanding, no dividends, except as described in the next succeeding sentence,
shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on Parity Securities, for
any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are
declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set
apart for such payment on the Series C Preferred Stock for all Dividend Periods
terminating on or prior to the date of payment of the dividend on such class or
series of parity stock. When dividends are not paid in full or a sum
sufficient for such payment is not set apart, as aforesaid, all dividends
declared upon shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and all dividends declared
upon any other Parity Security shall be declared ratably in proportion to the
respective amounts of dividends accumulated and unpaid on the Series C
Preferred Stock and accumulated and unpaid on such Parity Security.
<PAGE> 4

(d) So long as any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are
outstanding, no dividends (other than dividends or distributions paid in
shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares
of, Junior Securities) shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment or
other distribution declared or made upon Junior Securities, nor shall any
Junior Securities be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired (all such
dividends, distributions, redemptions or purchases being hereinafter referred
to as a "JUNIOR SECURITIES DISTRIBUTION") for any consideration (or any moneys
be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any
shares of any such stock) by the Corporation, directly or indirectly (except by
conversion into or exchange for Junior Securities), unless in each case (i) the
full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred
Stock and any other Parity Securities shall have been paid or set apart for
payment for all past Dividend Periods with respect to the Series C Preferred
Stock and all past dividend periods with respect to such Parity Securities and
(ii) sufficient funds shall have been paid or set apart for the payment of the
dividend for the current Dividend Period with respect to the Series C Preferred
Stock and the current dividend period with respect to such Parity Securities.

(4) Liquidation Preference. (a) In the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or
involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the assets of the
Corporation (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the
holders of Junior Securities, the holders of the shares of Series C Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive $100 per share of Series C Preferred Stock
plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared)
accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders;
but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. If, upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the
Corporation, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares
of Series C Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the
preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any Parity
Securities, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed
among the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any such other
Parity Securities ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would
be payable on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any such other stock
if all amounts payable thereon were paid in
<PAGE> 5
5

full. For the purposes of this paragraph (4), a sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the Corporation's assets, shall be deemed to be a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the
Corporation, but a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or more
corporations shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding
up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Corporation.

(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of any Parity
Securities, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the
Series C Preferred Stock, as provided in this paragraph (4), any other series
or class or classes of Junior Securities shall, subject to the respective terms
and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all
assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.

(5) Redemption. (a) To the extent the Corporation shall have
funds legally available for such payment, the Corporation may redeem at its
option at any time on or after December 16, 1999 or from time to time
thereafter, in whole or in part, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at a
redemption price of $100 per share in cash, together with accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption.

(b) To the extent the Corporation shall have funds legally
available for such payment, on December 15, 2014, if any shares of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall redeem all
outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, at a redemption price of
$100 per share in cash, together with accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to
such date.

(c) Immediately prior to authorizing or making any redemption
pursuant to this paragraph (5) the Corporation, by resolution of its Board of
Directors, shall, to the extent of any funds legally available therefor,
declare a dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock payable on the redemption
date in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series C
Preferred Stock as of such redemption date.

(d) If the Corporation is unable or shall fail to discharge
its obligation to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock
pursuant to paragraph (5)(b) (the "MANDATORY REDEMPTION OBLIGATION"), the
Mandatory Redemption
<PAGE> 6
6

Obligation shall be discharged as soon as the Corporation is able to discharge
such Mandatory Redemption Obligation. If and so long as any Mandatory
Redemption Obligation with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock shall not be
fully discharged, the Corporation shall not (i) directly or indirectly, redeem,
purchase, or otherwise acquire any Parity Security or discharge any mandatory
or optional redemption, sinking fund or other similar obligation in respect of
any Parity Securities (except in connection with a redemption, sinking fund or
other similar obligation to be satisfied pro rata with the Series C Preferred
Stock) or (ii) in accordance with paragraph (3)(d), declare or make any Junior
Securities Distribution, or, directly or indirectly, discharge any mandatory or
optional redemption, sinking fund or other similar obligation in respect of the
Junior Securities.

(e) Shares of Series C Preferred Stock which have been issued
and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed, shall
(upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State of
Delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class of
Preferred Stock undesignated as to series and may be redesignated and reissued
as part of any series of the Preferred Stock; provided that no such issued and
reacquired shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be reissued or sold as
Series C Preferred Stock.

(6) Procedure for Redemption. (a) In the event that fewer
than all the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be redeemed,
the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board of
Directors and the shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (with any
fractional shares being rounded to the nearest whole share) as nearly as
practicable or by lot, or by such other method as the Board of Directors may
determine to be equitable.

(b) In the event the Corporation shall redeem shares of
Series C Preferred Stock, notice of such redemption shall be given by first
class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days
prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be
redeemed at such holder's address as the same appears on the stock register of
the Corporation; provided that neither the failure to give such notice nor any
defect therein shall affect the validity of the giving of notice for the
redemption of any share of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed except as to
the holder to
<PAGE> 7
7

whom the Corporation has failed to give said notice or except as to the holder
whose notice was defective. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption
date; (ii) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed and,
if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number
of shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the
place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be
redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date.

(c) Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after
the redemption date (unless default shall be made by the Corporation in
providing money for the payment of the redemption price of the shares called
for redemption), dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock so called
for redemption shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the holders thereof as
stockholders of the Corporation (except the right to receive from the
Corporation the redemption price) shall cease. Upon surrender in accordance
with said notice of the certificates for the shares so redeemed (properly
endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Corporation
shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed
by the Corporation at the redemption price aforesaid. In case fewer than all
the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate
shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder
thereof.

(7) Voting Rights. (a) The holders of record of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights except as
hereinafter provided in this paragraph (7) or as otherwise provided by law.

(b) If and whenever six quarterly dividends (whether or not
consecutive) payable on the Series C Preferred Stock have not been paid in full
or if the Corporation shall have failed to discharge its Mandatory Redemption
Obligation, the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors
shall be increased by two and the holders of shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, together with the holders of shares of every other series of preferred
stock upon which like rights to vote for the election of two additional
directors have been conferred and are exercisable (resulting from either the
failure to pay dividends or the failure to redeem)(any such other series is
referred to as the "PREFERRED SHARES"), voting as a single
<PAGE> 8
8

class regardless of series, shall be entitled to elect the two additional
directors to serve on the Board of Directors at any annual meeting of
stockholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting
of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares called
as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Series C
Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares then outstanding shall have been paid
and dividends thereon shall have been paid regularly for at least one year, or
the Corporation shall have fulfilled its Mandatory Redemption Obligation, as
the case may be, then the right of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock
and the Preferred Shares to elect such additional two directors shall cease
(but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of such voting
rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in six quarterly dividends
or failure to fulfill any Mandatory Redemption Obligation), and the terms of
office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares shall forthwith terminate and the
number of the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time
after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares, the secretary of the
Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of Series C
Preferred Stock (addressed to the secretary at the principal office of the
Corporation) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock and of the Preferred Shares for the election of the two
directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by
notice similar to that provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation for a special
meeting of the stockholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting
required to be called as above provided shall not be called by the secretary
within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock may call such meeting, upon the notice above provided,
and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation.
The directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof
if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. If any
vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares, a successor shall be elected by the
Board of Directors, upon the nomination of the then-remaining director elected
by the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and the Preferred Shares or the
successor of such remaining director, to serve until the next annual meeting of
the stockholders or special
<PAGE> 9
9

meeting held in place thereof if such office shall not have previously
terminated as provided above.

(c) Without the written consent of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock or the vote of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock at a meeting of
the holders of Series C Preferred Stock called for such purpose, the
Corporation will not (i) amend, alter or repeal any provision hereof or of the
Certificate of Incorporation (by merger or otherwise) so as to affect the
preferences, rights or powers of the Series C Preferred Stock; provided that
any such amendment that changes the dividend payable on or the liquidation
preference of the Series C Preferred Stock shall require the affirmative vote
at a meeting of holders of Series C Preferred Stock called for such purpose or
written consent of the holder of each share of Series C Preferred Stock; or
(ii) create any class or classes of stock ranking equal or prior to the Series
C Preferred Stock either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up or increase the number of authorized number of shares of any class
or classes of stock ranking equal or prior to the Series C Preferred Stock
either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent of the holders of the Series C
Preferred Stock shall be required for (i) the creation of any indebtedness of
any kind of the Corporation, (ii) the creation of any class of Junior
Securities or (iii) any increase or decrease in the amount of authorized Common
Stock or any increase, decrease or change in the par value thereof or in any
other terms thereof.

(d) In exercising the voting rights set forth in this
paragraph (7), each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall have one vote per
share, except that when any other series of preferred stock shall have the
right to vote with the Series C Preferred Stock as a single class on any
matter, then the Series C Preferred Stock and such other series shall have with
respect to such matters one vote per $100 of stated liquidation preference.
Except as set forth herein, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall not
have any relative, participating, optional or other special voting rights and
powers and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the
taking of any corporate action.

(8) Stockholders Agreement. The Series C Preferred Stock
shall be subject to the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement among the
Corporation, Kidder,

Peabody Group Inc. and General Electric Company dated December 16, 1994.

Designations are for convenience of reference only and shall not define, limit

basis assuming conversion or exchange of all outstanding securities of the
Company convertible into or exchangeable for Voting Securities and the exercise

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.01, Parent and its Affiliates
shall be permitted to transfer any portion of or all their shares of Voting
Securities or Redeemable Preferred Stock under the following circumstances:

transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement,

Securities only so long as such subsidiary shall remain a subsidiary of
Parent and provided further that no such transfer shall relieve Parent or
Shareholder of their obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) subject to the Company's rights under Section 4.04, in the
case of shares of Common Stock 

7
<PAGE> 11
(including Common Stock issuable upon conversion or redemption of the 
Convertible Preferred Stock), transfers made pursuant to (A) a Broad 
Public Distribution or (B) Rule 144 under the 1933 Act, provided that any 
such sale pursuant to Rule 144 shall be subject to the volume and manner of 
sale limitations set forth in such Rule whether or not legally required;

(iii) subject to the Company's rights under Section 4.04, in the
case of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, after the fifth anniversary

(v) transfers of any portion of or all its shares of Redeemable
Preferred Stock to any person, provided that (A) Parent shall give not less
than 45 days prior written notice to the Company of its intention to

the terms of this Section 4.02(a)(v). Such notice shall specify the number
of shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock proposed to be transferred and the
date of the proposed transfer of such shares.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Voting Securities shall not be transferred by Parent or any of its Affiliates
to any person pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or acquisition of
control of the Company or similar transaction which is opposed by the Company's
Board of Directors.

Section 4.03. Company Call Right. (a) The Company shall have
the right (the "Call Right"), exercisable at any time or from time to time,
upon written notice to Shareholder (the "Call Notice"), to elect to purchase a
portion (to the extent provided below) of or all the shares of Common Stock
then held by Shareholder, at a purchase price per share payable in cash (the
"Call Price") equal to the greater of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock as of the date of delivery of the Call Notice and (y) $23.95634.
Delivery of any Call Notice by the Company to Shareholder shall be irrevocable.

8
<PAGE> 12
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.03(a), if the
Company exercises its Call Right for less than all of the Common Stock then
held by Shareholder, (i) if immediately prior to such exercise, Parent
beneficially owns not less than the Equity Treatment Percentage of outstanding
Common Stock and, at such time, Parent accounts for such ownership of Common
Stock in accordance with the equity method of accounting, then the Company
shall be permitted to exercise its Call Right in part only to the extent that
such exercise would not reduce the percentage of outstanding Common Stock
beneficially owned by Parent below the Equity Treatment Percentage and (ii) if
immediately prior to such exercise, the Company is a 20-percent owned
corporation within the meaning of Section 243(c)(2) of the Code as in effect on
the date hereof (a "20-percent owned corporation") of the Shareholder, then the
Company shall be permitted to exercise its Call Right in part only to the
extent that such exercise would not result in the Company ceasing to be a
20-percent owned corporation of the Shareholder. For purposes of clause (ii)
of this paragraph (b), (A) the term "stock" shall have the same meaning as in
Section 243(c)(2) of the Code as in effect on the date hereof and (B) all
shares of stock of the Company held by Shareholder or any Affiliate of
Shareholder shall be treated as if they were held by a single legal entity.
Nothing in this Section 4.03(b) shall be construed to limit the Company's right
to exercise its Call Right at any time in respect of all the Common Stock held
by Shareholder at such time.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.03(a), the Call
Right shall be suspended and shall not be exercisable by the Company during the
pendency of any transaction described in Section 4.02(a)(iv) following the time
at which the Company shall publicly announce or otherwise disclose to
Shareholder that the Board of Directors of the Company does not oppose such
transaction.

(d) Any purchase of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to this
Section 4.03 shall be on a mutually determined closing date which shall not be
more than 30 days after delivery of the Call Notice. The closing shall be held
at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the principal office of the Company, or at such
other time or place as the parties mutually agree.

(e) On the closing date, Shareholder shall deliver (i)
certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being sold, free and clear
of any lien, claim or encumbrance, and (ii) such other documents, including
evidence of ownership and authority, as the Company may reasonably request.
The Call Price shall be paid by wire

9
<PAGE> 13
transfer of immediately available funds no later than 2:00 p.m., local time, on
the closing date.

Section 4.04. Right of First Refusal. (a) If Shareholder desires
to transfer any shares of Common Stock (including Common Stock issuable upon
conversion or redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock) pursuant to
Section 4.02(a)(ii) or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 4.02(a)(iii), Shareholder shall give prompt written notice (the
"Transfer Notice") to the Company of such intention, specifying the number of
shares of Common Stock or Convertible Preferred Stock proposed to be
transferred (the "Offered Shares"). The Transfer Notice shall constitute an
irrevocable offer (the "Offer") by Shareholder to sell to the Company the
Offered Shares at a price (the "Offer Price") equal to (x) in the case of the
Convertible Preferred Stock, the aggregate price specified by Shareholder in
the Transfer Notice and (y) in the case of the Common Stock, the aggregate Fair
Market Value of such Offered Shares on the date of delivery of the Transfer
Notice. The Company shall have the right, exercisable by written notice given
by the Company to Shareholder within 30 days after receipt of such Transfer
Notice, to purchase (or to cause a person or group designated by the Company to
purchase) all, but not a part of, the Offered Shares specified in such Transfer
Notice for cash at the Offer Price by delivery of a notice (the "Exercise
Notice") to Shareholder stating the Company's irrevocable acceptance of the
Offer.

(b) If the Company elects to purchase the Offered Shares, the
closing of the purchase of the Offered Shares shall take place on a mutually
acceptable closing date which shall be not more than 30 days after delivery of
the Exercise Notice. The closing shall be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, at
the principal office of the Company or at such other time or place as the
parties mutually agree.

(c) On the closing date, Shareholder shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) (i) certificates representing the Offered Shares, free and clear
of any lien, claim or encumbrance, and (ii) such other documents, including
evidence of ownership and authority, as the Company may reasonably request.
The Offer Price shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
no later than 2:00 p.m., local time, on the closing date.

(d) If the Company fails to elect to purchase the Offered Shares
within the period specified in Section 4.03(a), (i) Shareholder shall be free,
during the period of 90 days following the expiration of such period, to
transfer any portion of or all the Offered Shares

10
<PAGE> 14
pursuant to Section 4.02(a)(ii) or 4.02(a)(iii), as the case may be, and (ii)
the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its Call Right with respect to
the Offered Shares during the period from the date of the Transfer Notice to
the end of such 90-day period. Offered Shares not so transferred within such
90-day period shall again become subject to the procedures provided for in this
Section 4.04 and to the Call Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case
of any proposed transfer of any portion or all of the Offered Shares pursuant
to Section 4.02(a)(ii)(B) under Rule 144 at a price (the "Reduced Offer Price")
less than 95% of the Offer Price, Shareholder shall first offer such Offered
Shares to the Company by notice (oral or written) to the Senior Vice President
and Senior Associate General Counsel of PaineWebber Incorporated made during
regular business hours. The Company shall have the right, exercisable by the
close of business on the immediately following Business Day after receipt of
such notice from Shareholder, to purchase all, but not a part of, such Offered
Shares at the Reduced Offer Price. If the Company does not elect to purchase
such Offered Shares, Shareholder may transfer such Offered Shares under Rule
144 pursuant to Section 4.02(a)(ii)(B) at a price equal to or above the Reduced
Offer Price, provided that any Offered Shares not so transferred within ten
Business Days shall again become subject to the procedures provided for in this
Section 4.04(d).

Section 4.05. Assignment. The Company may assign any of its
rights under Section 4.03 or 4.04 to any person without the consent of
Shareholder; provided that no such assignment shall relieve the Company of any
of its obligations pursuant to Section 4.03 or 4.04. In the event that the
Company elects to exercise a right under Section 4.03 or 4.04, the Company may
specify in its Call Notice or Exercise Notice, as applicable, or thereafter
prior to purchase, another such person as its designee to purchase the Offered
Shares to which such Call Notice or Exercise Notice, as applicable, relates.

ARTICLE V

Registration Rights

Section 5.01. Registration Upon Request. (a) Parent shall have
the right to make written demand upon the Company, on not more than five
separate occasions (subject to the provisions of this Section 5.01), to
register under the 1933 Act (i) shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock, (ii)
shares of Common Stock issued to Shareholder pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, acquired upon conversion of the

11
<PAGE> 15
Convertible Preferred Stock, or acquired in accordance with Section 6.01 of
this Agreement or (iii) at any time following the fifth anniversary of the date
hereof, shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (the shares subject to such
demand hereunder being referred to as the "Subject Stock"), and the Company
shall use its best efforts to cause such shares to be registered under the 1933
Act as soon as reasonably practicable so as to permit the sale thereof
promptly; provided that each such demand shall cover at least (A) $50,000,000
liquidation preference of Redeemable Preferred Stock, (B) $100,000,000
liquidation preference of Convertible Preferred Stock or (C) 5,000,000 shares
of Common Stock, in the case of the first such demand relating to Common Stock,
or 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock in any subsequent demand relating to Common
Stock (subject in each case to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock
splits, stock dividends and similar events after the date hereof), as the case
may be. In connection therewith, the Company shall as promptly as practicable
prepare, file (on Form S-3 if permitted or otherwise on the appropriate form)
and use its best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement
under the 1933 Act to effect such registration. Parent and Shareholder agree
to provide all such information and materials and to take all such action as
may be reasonably required in order to permit the Company to comply with all
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the Commission and to obtain any
desired acceleration of the effective date of such registration statement.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.01(a) and
5.01(c), the Company (i) shall not be obligated to prepare or file more than
one registration statement pursuant to this Section 5.01 during any 12-month
period and (ii) shall be entitled to postpone the filing of any registration
statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by the Company pursuant
to Section 5.01(a) (A) for a period of up to 60 days following completion of
any underwritten public offering of securities contemplated by the Company
prior to receipt of a demand for registration hereunder, provided that the
Company is advised by its managing underwriter or underwriters in writing (with
a copy to Shareholder), that the price at which securities would be offered in
such offering would, in its or their opinion, be materially adversely affected
by the registration so requested, or (B) for a period of up to 135 days if the
Company determines in its reasonable judgment and in good faith that the
registration and distribution of the shares of Subject Stock would impair or
interfere with in any material respect any contemplated material financing,
acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other similar transaction
or other material corporate development involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or

12
<PAGE> 16
Affiliates or would require premature disclosure thereof, and such disclosure
is not practicable in the Company's reasonable judgment in light of the facts
and circumstances then existing or would impair or interfere with in any
material respect such transaction or would otherwise materially adversely
affect the Company. In the event of such postponement, Parent shall have the
right to withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice to the
Company within 20 days after receipt of notice of postponement and, in the
event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted for purposes of
determining the number of registrations to which Parent is entitled pursuant to
this Section 5.01.

(c) In addition to the rights of Parent set forth in Section
5.01(a), if at any time the Company shall exercise its right pursuant to
paragraph (5)(d) of the Certificate of Designation of Rights and Preferences
for the Convertible Preferred Stock to deliver shares of Common Stock in lieu
of cash in payment of the redemption price for any shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock, Parent shall have the right, exercisable within 30 days
following receipt of notice of such redemption for Common Stock, to make an
additional written demand upon the Company to register under the 1933 Act any
or all shares of Common Stock received in connection with such redemption, and
the Company shall use its best efforts to cause such shares to be registered
under the 1933 Act as soon as reasonably practicable so as to permit the sale
thereof promptly, subject to the provisions of Section 5.01(b).

(d) Except in accordance with the provisions of the Amended
and Restated Investment Agreement (the "Yasuda Agreement") dated as of November
5, 1992, between the Company and The Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Company
("Yasuda"), the Company shall not grant to any other holder of its securities,
whether currently outstanding or issued in the future, any incidental or
piggyback registration rights with respect to any registration statement filed
pursuant to a demand registration under this Section 5.01 and, except as
aforesaid with respect to the rights of Yasuda, without the prior consent of
Parent, the Company will not permit any holder of its securities other than
Yasuda to participate in any offering made pursuant to a demand registration
under this Section 5.01.

Section 5.02. Incidental Registration Rights. If the Company
proposes to register any of its Common Stock under the 1933 Act (other than (i)
pursuant to Section 5.01 hereof, (ii) securities to be issued pursuant to a
stock option or other employee benefit or similar plan, or (iii) securities
proposed to be issued in exchange for securities

13
<PAGE> 17
or assets of, or in connection with a merger or consolidation with, another
corporation) the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give written notice
to Parent of the Company's intention to effect such registration. If, within
15 days after receipt of such notice, Parent submits a written request to the
Company specifying the amount of Common Stock that it proposes to sell or
otherwise dispose of in accordance with this Section 5.02, the Company shall
use its best efforts to include the shares specified in Parent's request in
such registration. If in a registration other than pursuant to Section 2.3 of
the Yasuda Agreement, the managing underwriters reasonably determine in good
faith and advise Shareholder in writing that the inclusion in the registration
statement of all the Common Stock proposed to be included would interfere with
the successful marketing and sale of the securities proposed to be registered,
then the amount of Common Stock to be registered by Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.02 shall be reduced to the amount, if any, determined by the managing
underwriters in good faith that would not interfere with such marketing and
sale, provided that if securities are being offered for the account of any
Person other than the Company, then the amount of securities of such other
Person and Shareholder shall be reduced proportionately based on the number of
securities each such Person requested to be included in the offering. If in a
registration pursuant to Section 2.3 of the Yasuda Agreement, Yasuda advises
the Company that in Yasuda's reasonable judgment registration of the
Shareholder's shares of Common Stock would adversely affect the offering and
sale of its securities under the Yasuda Agreement, then the number of
Shareholder's shares of Common Stock to be included in such offering shall be
reduced to the amount, if any, determined by Yasuda in its reasonable judgment,
that would not adversely affect such offering and sale. No registration
effected under this Section 5.02 shall relieve the Company of its obligation to
effect any registration upon request under Section 5.01. If Shareholder has
been permitted to participate in a proposed offering pursuant to this Section
5.02, the Company thereafter may determine either not to file a registration
statement relating thereto, or to withdraw such registration statement, or
otherwise not to consummate such offering, without any liability hereunder.

Section 5.03. Broad Public Distribution; Lead Manager. (a) The
Company shall be required to register Subject Stock that is Common Stock
pursuant to this Article V only if such Common Stock is to be offered and sold
in a Broad Public Distribution.

(b) The Company shall be required to register Subject Stock
pursuant to this Article V only if such

14
<PAGE> 18
Subject Stock is to be offered and sold in an underwritten distribution
lead-managed by the Company's principal broker-dealer subsidiary, provided
that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, the proposed terms of offering by
such subsidiary are customary and reasonably competitive and provided further
that Parent in all cases shall have the right to designate a non-book-running
co-lead manager for any such offering.

Section 5.04. Registration Mechanics. (a) In connection with
any offering of shares of Subject Stock registered pursuant to Section 5.01 or
5.02 herein, the Company shall (i) furnish to Shareholder such number of copies
of any prospectus (including preliminary and summary prospectuses) and
conformed copies of the registration statement (including amendments or
supplements thereto and, in each case, all exhibits) and such other documents
as it may reasonably request, but only while the Company shall be required
under the provisions hereof to cause the registration statement to remain
current; (ii)(A) use its best efforts to register or qualify the Subject Stock
covered by such registration statement under such blue sky or other state
securities laws for offer and sale as Shareholder shall reasonably request and
(B) keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as the
registration statement remains in effect; provided that the Company shall not
be obligated to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation under the laws
of any jurisdiction in which it shall not then be qualified or to file any
general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction in which such a
consent has not been previously filed or subject itself to taxation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not otherwise be subject to tax but for the
requirements of this Section 5.04; (iii) use its best efforts to cause all
shares of Subject Stock covered by such registration statement to be registered
with or approved by such other federal or state government agencies or
authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of counsel to the Company to
enable Shareholder to consummate the disposition of such shares of Subject
Stock; (iv) notify Shareholder any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the 1933 Act upon discovery that, or upon the
happening of any event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such
registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, and (subject to the good faith
determination of the Company's Board of Directors as to whether to permit sales
under such registration statement), at the request of Shareholder promptly
prepare and furnish to it a reasonable

15
<PAGE> 19
number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may
be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such
securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made; (v) otherwise use its best efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC; (vi) use its best
efforts to list, if required by the rules of the applicable securities exchange
or, if securities of the same class are then so listed, the Subject Stock
covered by such registration statement on the NYSE or on any other securities
exchange on which Subject Stock is then listed; (vii) before filing any
registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, and as far in
advance as is reasonably practicable, furnish to Shareholder and its counsel
copies of such documents; and (viii) furnish to Shareholder, addressed to it,
an opinion of counsel for the Company, dated the date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement relating to any underwritten offering covering
substantially the same matters with respect to such registration statement (and
the prospectus included therein) as are customarily covered in opinions of
counsel delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings of
securities.

(b) In connection with any offering of Subject Stock registered
pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.02, the Company shall (x) furnish to the
underwriter, if any, unlegended certificates representing ownership of the
Subject Stock being sold in such denominations as requested and (y) instruct
any transfer agent and registrar of the Subject Stock to release any stop
transfer orders with respect to such Subject Stock.

(c) At any time that Parent shall not be entitled to designate a
nominee for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 3.02, in
connection with the preparation and filing of each registration statement
registering Subject Stock under the 1933 Act, the Company will give Shareholder
and the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel and accountants
(collectively, the "Inspectors"), such reasonable and customary access to its
books and records (collectively, the "Records") and such opportunities to
discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the independent
public accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall be
necessary, in the opinion of Shareholder and such underwriters or their
respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the 1933 Act. Records which the Company reasonably determines to be
confidential and which

16
<PAGE> 20
it notifies the Inspectors in writing are confidential shall not be disclosed
by the Inspectors unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary or
appropriate to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in the registration
statement, (ii) the portion of the Records to be disclosed has otherwise become
publicly known, (iii) the information in such Records is to be used in
connection with any litigation or governmental investigation or hearing
relating to any registration statement or (iv) the release of such Records is
ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order. Shareholder agrees that it
will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of
competent jurisdiction, give notice to the Company.

(d) Upon any registration becoming effective pursuant to Section
5.01, the Company shall use its best efforts to keep such registration
statement current for a period of 90 days or such shorter period as shall be
necessary to effect the distribution of the Subject Stock.

(e) Shareholder agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in clause (iv) of
Section 5.04(a), it will forthwith discontinue its disposition of Subject Stock
pursuant to the registration statement relating to such Subject Stock until its
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by
clause (iv) of Section 5.03(a) and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver
to the Company all copies then in its possession of the prospectus relating to
such Subject Stock current at the time of receipt of such notice. If
Shareholder's disposition of Subject Stock is discontinued pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, unless the Company thereafter extends the effectiveness of
the registration statement to permit dispositions of Subject Stock by
Shareholder for an aggregate of 90 days, whether or not consecutive, the
registration statement shall not be counted for purposes of determining the
number of registrations to which Shareholder is entitled pursuant to Section
5.01.

Section 5.05. Expenses. In connection with any registration
pursuant to this Article V (i) Shareholder shall pay all agent fees and
commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions related to shares of
Subject Stock being sold by Shareholder and the fees and disbursements of its
counsel and accountants and (ii) the Company shall pay all fees and
disbursements of its counsel and accountants and the expenses (including the
fees of any separate counsel) of any "qualified independent underwriter"
required in accordance with the Rules of Fair Practice of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. All other fees and expenses in
connection with any registration

17
<PAGE> 21
statement (including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, all
printing costs, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky
laws) shall (i) in the case of a registration pursuant to Section 5.01, be
borne by Shareholder and (ii) in the case of a registration pursuant to Section
5.02, be shared pro rata based upon the respective market values of the
securities to be sold by the Company, Shareholder and any other holders
participating in such offering; provided that Shareholder shall not pay any
expenses relating to work that would otherwise be incurred by the Company
including, but not limited to, the preparation and filing of periodic reports
with the Commission.

Section 5.06. Indemnification and Contribution. In the case of
any offering registered pursuant to this Article V, the Company agrees to
indemnify and hold Shareholder, each underwriter, if any, of the Subject Stock
under such registration and each person who controls any of the foregoing
within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, and any officer, employee or
partner of the foregoing, harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages,
or liabilities (including reasonable legal fees and other reasonable expenses
incurred in the investigation and defense thereof) to which they or any of them
may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise (collectively "Losses"),
insofar as any such Losses shall arise out of or shall be based upon (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the registration statement relating to the sale of such Subject Stock (as
amended if the Company shall have filed with the SEC any amendment thereof), or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the prospectus relating to the sale of such Subject Stock (as
amended or supplemented if the Company shall have filed with the SEC any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided that the indemnification contained in this Section 5.06
shall not apply to such Losses which shall arise out of or shall be based upon
any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or
alleged omission, which shall have been made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by Shareholder or any such
underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for use in connection with the
preparation of the registration statement or prospectus

18
<PAGE> 22
contained in the registration statement or any such amendment thereof or
supplement therein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.06, the
Company will not be liable to Shareholder, any person who participates as an
underwriter in the offering or sale of Subject Stock or any other person, if
any, who controls Shareholder or any underwriter (within the meaning of the
1933 Act), under the indemnity agreement in this Section 5.06 for any such
Losses that arise out of Shareholder or other person's failure to send or give
a copy of the final prospectus to the person asserting an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the
written confirmation of the sale of the Subject Stock to such person if such
statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus and the Company
has previously furnished copies thereof in accordance with this Agreement.

In the case of each offering registered pursuant to this Article
V, Parent shall, or shall cause General Electric Capital Services, Inc. or
another member of the Financial Services Group, reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the "Parent Indemnitor") to, agree and each underwriter, if any,
participating therein shall agree, substantially in the same manner and to the
same extent as set forth in the preceding paragraph, severally to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and each person who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, and any director, officer, employee or
partner of the Company, with respect to any statement in or omission from such
registration statement or prospectus contained in such registration statement
(as amended or as supplemented, if amended or supplemented as aforesaid) if
such statement or omission shall have been made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by Parent,
Shareholder or such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for use in
connection with the preparation of such registration statement or prospectus
contained in such registration statement or any such amendment thereof or
supplement thereto.

Each party indemnified under this Section 5.06 shall, promptly
after receipt of notice of the commencement of any claim against such
indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof. The failure of
any indemnified party to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability in respect of such action which it may
have to such indemnified party on account of the indemnity contained in this
Section 5.06, unless (and only to the

19
<PAGE> 23
extent) the indemnifying party was prejudiced by such failure, and in no event
shall such failure relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability
which it may have to such indemnified party. In case any action in respect of
which indemnification may be sought hereunder shall be brought against any
indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement
thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and,
to the extent that it may desire, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof through counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this Section 5.06 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, other than
reasonable costs of investigation (unless (i) such indemnified party reasonably
objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available
to it which are different from or in addition to those available to such
indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party
shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (iii) in the
reasonable opinion of such indemnified party representation of such indemnified
party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party
and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding, in which
case the indemnified party shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party for
the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with retaining separate legal
counsel). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of
the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any claim or pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could
have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of
such indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim or
proceeding.

If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.06 is
unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold such indemnified
party harmless from any Losses in respect of which this Section 5.06 would
otherwise apply by its terms (other than by reason of exceptions provided
herein), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
Losses, in such proportion as is

20
<PAGE> 24
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by and fault of the
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other
hand, in connection with the offering to which such contribution relates as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the amount of proceeds
received by each party from the offering to which such contribution relates.
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
each party's relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter
with respect to which the claim was asserted, and the opportunity to correct
and prevent any statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party
as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or
expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding, to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such
expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.06 was available
to such party.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this Section 5.06 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 5.07. Underwriting Agreement. (a) In connection with
any underwritten offering of Subject Stock pursuant to a registration requested
under Section 5.01, the Company, the Parent Indemnitor and Shareholder will
enter into an underwriting agreement with the underwriters for such offering,
such agreement to contain such representations and warranties by the Company,
the Parent Indemnitor and Shareholder and such other terms and provisions as
are customarily contained in the underwriting agreements with respect to
secondary distributions, including, without limitation, indemnities and
contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in Section 5.06 (and
customary provisions with respect to indemnities and contribution by such
underwriters).

(b) In connection with any underwritten offering of Subject Stock
pursuant to a registration requested under Section 5.02, the Company may
require the Common Stock requested to be registered pursuant to Section 5.02 to
be included in such underwriting on the same terms and

21
<PAGE> 25
conditions as shall be applicable to Common Stock being sold by the Company
through underwriters under such registration. In such case, the Parent
Indemnitor and Shareholder shall be a party to any such underwriting agreement.
Such agreement shall contain such representations, warranties and covenants by
the Parent Indemnitor and Shareholder and such other terms and provisions as
are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with respect to secondary
distributions, including, without limitation, indemnities and contribution to
the effect and to the extent provided in Section 5.06 (and customary provisions
with respect to indemnities and contribution by such underwriters).

Section 6.01. Shareholder Purchase Rights. (a) If, immediately
after giving effect to and as a result of any issuance of Voting Securities by

the Equity Treatment Percentage of the total number of shares of Common Stock
then outstanding and, at such time, Parent accounts for such ownership of
Common Stock in accordance with the equity method of accounting, Parent shall
have the right to acquire, at any time or from time to time thereafter, in the
open market or in private transactions, a number of shares of Common Stock in

Shareholder shall have the right to acquire at any time or from time to time
thereafter, in the open market or in private transactions, a number of shares
of Common Stock sufficient (together with any shares acquired pursuant to
Section 6.01(a)) to enable Shareholder to treat the Company as a 20-percent
owned corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (b), (i) the term "stock"
shall have the same meaning as in Section 243(c)(2) of the Code as in effect on
the date hereof, and (ii) all shares of stock of the Company held by
Shareholder or any Affiliate of Shareholder shall be treated as if they were
held by a single legal entity.

of the Company at any time after October 17, 1994 and before the date of this

to time after the date hereof, in the open market or in private transactions,
the number of shares of Common Stock determined in accordance with Section
6.01(a) or (b), as applicable, that Shareholder would have had the right to
acquire pursuant to this Section 6.01 had this Agreement been in effect at such
time.
