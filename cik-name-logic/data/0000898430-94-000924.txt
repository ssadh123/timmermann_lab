ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On November 29, 1994, Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) issued the
following news release:

HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES, INC. SUBSIDIARIES RECEIVE ORDER ON
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT ACCOUNTING

HONOLULU -- Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (NYSE - HE) today reported
that the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission issued a decision and order on
a generic docket authorizing recovery of the full cost of postretirement
benefits other than pensions. The generic docket stemmed from a new
accounting pronouncement ("Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" - SFAS 106) which mandated accrual accounting
for the cost of postretirement benefits, rather than pay-as-you-go
accounting.

The order affects HEI's electric utility subsidiaries that serve the
islands of Oahu, Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Hawaii, as well as its maritime
freight transportation subsidiary. The order takes effect January 1, 1995.

Hawaiian Electric Industries is a diversified holding company that delivers
essential services to the people of Hawaii through its electric utility,
savings bank, maritime freight transportation and real estate development
subsidiaries.
