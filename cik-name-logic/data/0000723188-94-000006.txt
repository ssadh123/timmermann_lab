FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

June 4, 1994

COMMUNITY BANK, N.A. Purchases Three Branches

Syracuse, New York, June 4, 1994 -- COMMUNITY BANK,
N.A.(CBNA), a DeWitt-based bank with $785 million in assets which
has its Southern Region Headquarters in Olean, NY, is pleased to
announce that it has just assumed the deposit liabilities for
three branches of the former Columbia Banking FSA from the
Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC).

The purchase includes deposits totaling nearly $63.0 million
and banking facilities for the three offices, which will now
operate under the COMMUNITY BANK, N.A. name.

The locations purchased and deposit values of each include:
Canandaigua in Ontario County, deposits of $33.2 million; Corning
in Steuben County, deposit of $15.3 million; and Wellsville in
Allegany County, deposits of $14.5 million. Pending regulatory
approval, the current CBNA Canandaigua and Corning offices will
be consolidated into the respective former Columbia Banking
locations, which are larger and more convenient facilities.

CBNA is recognized by VERIBANC,Inc. and several other bank
monitoring and rating services as consistently achieving the
highest levels of financial safety, soundness and strength.

This branch acquisition is expected by management to
positively impact future financial performance by gaining
additional marketing and operational efficiencies, expanding
market share in its primary trade areas, and capitalizing on the
increasing value of the core deposits in a rising interest rate
environment.
<PAGE> 
COMMUNITY BANK is particularly pleased that it will now be
able to bring its style of local, responsive banking to the new
market of Wellsville. The Bank's customer service philosophy is
based on local decision making, community commitment, and
personalized service. Its now 36 banking offices are located
largely in small towns and villages throughout the Finger Lakes
Region, the Southern Tier including Southwestern New York, and
Northern New York. It is dedicated to being a good neighbor and
helping the communities in which it operated grow by converting
local deposits into local loans.

COMMUNITY BANK offers a full-range of high-quality products
and services for both individuals and small businesses. These
include FDIC insured checking and savings deposits, a variety of
personal and commercial loans, personal and employee benefit
trust services, and a range of nonbank financial products
including annuities and mutual funds.

The bank is a wholly-owned banking subsidiary of Community
Bank System, Inc., a registered bank holding company based in
DeWitt, New York. It is listed on the NASDAQ national market
under CBSI trading symbol.
