Item 5. Other Events

On March 3, 1994, Dairy Mart Convenience Stores, Inc. (the "Company") 
issued $75 million of 10.25% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2004 (the "Notes")
through a public offering underwritten by Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc. (the 
"Underwriter").

The Company used part of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes: 
(1) to repay the entire indebtedness outstanding of approximately $34.0 
million under the Company's credit agreement with Chemical Bank (as successor
to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company) as agent lender, along with other 
lenders party thereto, dated as of January 9, 1991, as amended (the "Existing
Credit Agreement"); and (2) to redeem all of the Company's outstanding 14.25%
Subordinated Debentures Due 2000 ("Subordinated Debentures") in the aggregate 
principal amount of $27.9 million, which amount includes a premium for early 
redemption, and which redemption is expected to be completed on or about 
April 4, 1994. The Company estimates that the net proceeds of the sale of 
the Notes remaining after the payment of the indebtedness under the Existing 
Credit Agreement, the redemption of the Subordinated Debentures, the payment 
of the Underwriter's discount, and the payment of fees expenses will be 
approximately $11.0 million and will be used for working capital and general 
corporate purposes.

In connection with the sale of the Notes and the repayment of the entire 
indebtedness outstanding under the existing Credit Agreement, the Company 
entered into a new credit agreement with Fleet Bank, National Association 
("Fleet") and Society National Bank ("Society") (the "New Credit Agreement"). 
Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow up to $30.0 
million under revolving credit loans (including up to $15.0 million for 
letters of credit). All outstanding indebtedness under the New Credit
Agreement will be due and payable in full on March 1, 1997; however, provided
no default exists under the New Credit Agreement, the Company may extend such
due date for up to two additional one-year periods, with the consent of the 
lenders.

All amounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement are secured by 
the pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of most of the Company's 
direct and indirect subsidiaries, and by amounts payable to the Company which 
arise by, from, or were created by, loans or other extensions of credit by 
the Company to any of its subsidiaries. Loans under the New Credit Agreement 
will generally bear interest, at the Company's option, at the per annum rate 
of either (1) 0.25% above Fleet's then current prime rate and/or (2) from 
2.00% to 2.50% above LIBOR.
