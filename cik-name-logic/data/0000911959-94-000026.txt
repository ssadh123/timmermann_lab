FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Addington Resources' restructuring costs result in third quarter
loss

ASHLAND, Ky. (October 19, 1994) -- Addington Resources, Inc.
(NASDAQ National Market: ADDR) today reported lower operating
income for the quarter ending September 30, 1994.

In addition, the company posted $20.9 million in various
restructuring and other one-time charges, resulting in a net loss
of $11.8 million (75 cents per share) for the quarter. Revenues
were $38.1 million.

Pre-tax operating income, excluding restructuring and
one-time costs, was $2.7 million, or 17 cents per share, for
1994's third quarter. Operating income for the comparable 1993
period was $7.6 million.

For the year to date, pre-tax operating income, excluding
the restructuring and one-time charges, was $9.1 million, or 57
cents per share. The nine-month net loss was $7.4 million (47
cents per share). Revenues were $114.9 million.

Addington Resources President Kirby Taylor said the $20.9
million set aside in non-recurring charges and write-offs
reflected management's drive to operate fewer, yet more
profitable, businesses, and to restate certain assets to market
value.

The actions provide a foundation for growth and
profitability, complementing the sale of most coal operations to
Pittston early in 1994, he said.

"Our integrated waste management business is thriving and
expanding, and there's great potential in our contract mining and
gold operations," Taylor said. "These restructuring costs,
combined with a number of other significant management and
operating changes, will make Addington Resources a more
structured and focused company."

The write-offs and restructuring costs include:

The $6.8 million balance for a note receivable taken in
connection with the company's 1992 sale of Southern Illinois
Mining Company. The acquiring company is in bankruptcy.

Approximately $2.0 million to write off various coal assets
that won't be utilized in the remaining coal operations.

A $1.1 million investment in a recycling company and
$670,000 invested in other environmental projects.

The $3.4 million invested in developing limestone mining
operations, which the company has cancelled.

The working capital adjustment associated with the sale of
the various coal properties to Pittston was finalized during the
third quarter of 1994. The final adjustment resulted in a $6.3
million reduction in the previously reported gain on the
transaction.

The company also incurred $670,000 associated with
non-recurring one-time expenses associated with certain
management and legal expenses associated with the companies
attempts to sell the remaining coal operations.

Taylor said many concrete management and operational actions
have been taken to begin to reshape the company. Those include:

Placing the company's citrus operations in Belize and a
corporate jet for sale.

Implementing new capital expenditure, budgeting and
forecasting procedures.

Taking actions to improve the profitability of the company's
four remaining coal mines, so that management may reconsider
divesting those operations at a later date.

Realigning the manufacturing, marketing and operations
reporting responsibilities within Mining Technologies, Inc., the
business unit that oversees production of the company's patented
highwall mining machines and the licensing agreement with Joy
Technologies, Inc.

Restructuring management at Addington Environmental, Inc.,
the company's integrated waste company, to further improve the
company's landfill businesses and to turn around the unit's
hauling businesses, which currently operate at a loss.

Third quarter revenues for Addington Environmental totaled
$9.9 million, a 53 percent increase over the year-earlier period.
Operating income before write-offs and non-recurring items was
$1.7 million, 89 percent above 1993's third quarter operating
income of $.9 million. For the year-to-date, environmental
revenues were $25.7 million and operating income before
write-offs and non-recurring items was $4.3 million, compared
with $17.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the first
nine months of 1993.

Coal operations, excluding MTI, generated third quarter 1994
operating income before write-offs and non-recurring items of
$1.7 million, on $25.4 million of revenues, compared with $6.6
million in operating income and $93 million in revenues during
the year-ago period.

Mining Technologies posted an operating loss of $45,000 
during the quarter.

Taylor said that the restructuring actions already
implemented, and those underway, should begin to show results as
early as the first or second quarter of fiscal 1995.

"I've been on the job less than four months, have assessed
the overall situation and have acted as quickly as possible in
making major decisions. My objective is to complete the reshaping
of the company within the next 12 to 18 months," Taylor said.

Addington Resources, Inc., traded on the NASDAQ National
Market under the symbol ADDR, is an integrated waste management,
mining and mining technology company.
