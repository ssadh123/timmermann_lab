STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT ( Agreement ) is made and entered
into as of February 14, 1994, by and among Fleet Financial Group, Inc., a
Rhode Island corporation ( Seller ), GFC Financial Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ( GFC ), and Greyhound Financial Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ( Buyer ). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Annex A hereto.

WHEREAS, Fleet Factors Corp., a Rhode Island corporation engaged
in the business of commercial lending and factoring (the Company ), has 100
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share
(the Company Common Stock ), all of which are owned by Seller; and

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller
desires to sell to Buyer, all of the Company Common Stock, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises and
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, Seller and Buyer agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF STOCK;
RETENTION OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES

1.1 Transfer of Stock. On the Closing Date (as defined in
Section 2.1 hereof) and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Seller will sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer all
of the Company Common Stock, free and clear of all Encumbrances (as defined
in Annex A hereto).

1.2 Consideration. (a) On the Closing Date and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, in reliance on the repre-
sentations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties contained
herein and in consideration of the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery
by Seller to Buyer of the Company Common Stock, Buyer will pay to Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by
Seller (which bank account will be so designated not less than two (2)
business days prior to the Closing (as defined in Section 2.1 hereof)) an
amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Shareholder s Equity
(determined as provided in Sections 1.3(b) and 1.3(d) hereof) of the Company
at and as of November 30, 1993 (the Purchase Price ).

(b) Within two (2) business days after the acceptance and
finality of the determination of such amount in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1.3(e) hereof, if the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of
the Company (determined as provided in Section 1.3(c) hereof) for the period
beginning December 1, 1993 to and including the last day of that calendar
month which ends prior to the Closing Date (the Interim Period ) is a
positive number, the Company shall pay a cash dividend to Seller in an
amount equal to the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of the Company for such
period, or, if the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of the Company for the Interim
Period is a negative number, Seller shall contribute, without consideration
therefor, to the Company in cash, an amount equal to the Adjusted Net Income
(Loss) of the Company for such period. Such payment shall be made by Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Seller or Buyer, respectively.

1.3 Closing Audit. (a) Seller has engaged KPMG Peat Marwick
(the Auditor ) to provide the services set forth in this Agreement and will
cause the Auditor to conduct an audit of the books and records of the Compa-
ny to determine the Shareholder s Equity of the Company at and as of Decem-
ber 31, 1992 and November 30, 1993 (the latter date being referred to herein
as the Audit Date ) and the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of the Company for
the one-year period ended December 31, 1992 and the eleven-month period
ended November 30, 1993 (collectively, the Closing Audit ). Seller shall
cause the Auditor to complete the Closing Audit as soon as practicable but
in no event later than February 14, 1994. The Closing Audit shall be con-
ducted in accordance with United States generally accepted auditing
standards, except to the extent set forth in this Section 1.3 or in Schedule
1.3 hereto. The Auditor shall have reasonable access to the books and
records (including workpapers) of the Company and of Seller and to all
appropriate employees, consultants and advisors of either, in each case
which reasonably relate to the performance of the Closing Audit and, as de-
scribed below, the review of the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of the Company
for the Interim Period. From time to time prior to delivery of the Closing
Audit Report (as defined in Section 1.3(d) hereof), Seller, Buyer and its
accountants shall be entitled to discuss with the Auditor the status of the
Closing Audit and preliminary determinations of the Auditor with respect
thereto and to review and comment upon drafts thereof.

(b) The Shareholder s Equity of the Company at and as of a
particular date (the Shareholder s Equity ) shall be determined (i) in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) but without regard to materiality, (ii) subtracting from such
resulting amount the increase in the book value of the Company attributable
to any extraordinary gains of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
reflected in the audited financial statements of the Company for such date,
and (iii) taking into account any adjustments required pursuant to Schedule
1.3 hereto.

(c) The Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of the Company for any
particular period shall be determined (i) in accordance with GAAP consistent
with the audited financial statements of the Company contained in the
Closing Audit Report and without regard to materiality (ii) after provision
for federal, state and local income taxes, and (iii) excluding extraordinary
gains of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such period.

(d) Promptly upon completion thereof, the Auditor shall
deliver simultaneously to the parties a copy of the Closing Audit, together
with its report thereon, and the Auditor s determination of the
Shareholder s Equity of the Company at and as of December 31, 1992 and
November 30, 1993 and the Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of the Company for the
one-year period ended December 31, 1992 and the eleven-month period ended
November 30, 1993 (the Closing Audit Report ). Copies of the workpapers
used in the preparation of the Closing Audit Report shall be delivered or
made fully available to Buyer no later than February 15, 1994. After
receipt of the Closing Audit Report, Buyer and Seller shall have seven (7)
business days to review the Closing Audit Report. Buyer, Seller and their
respective authorized representatives shall have reasonable access to the
employees of the Auditor, and Buyer and its authorized representatives shall
have access to all relevant books and records (including workpapers) and
employees of the Company and Seller, to the extent reasonably required to
complete their respective reviews of the Closing Audit Report. Unless Buyer
or Seller delivers written notice to the other party and the Auditor on or
prior to the seventh (7th) business day after delivery by the Auditor of the
Closing Audit Report, specifying in reasonable detail all disputed items and
the basis or bases therefor and that such party believes in good faith that
the aggregate effect of such disputed items could reasonably result in a
change in Shareholder's Equity of at least $1 million, the parties shall be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Closing Audit Report. If Buyer or
Seller notifies the Auditor and the other party in writing of an objection
or objections to the Closing Audit Report as provided above within such
seven (7) business days (the Preliminary Objection Notice ), Buyer and
Seller shall, until the tenth (10th) business day after delivery of the
Closing Audit Report, have the opportunity to provide written reports to the
Auditor supplementing the basis or bases for disputed items previously iden-
tified by such party to the Auditor or responding to the basis or bases set
forth by the other party for disputed items. A copy of any such written
report to the Auditor by either party shall simultaneously be provided by
such party to the other party. Based upon such written reports, the Auditor
shall make a final determination, within ten (10) business days after the
earlier to occur of receipt thereof from Buyer and Seller or expiration of
the ten (10) business day period in which such reports may be provided, of
the Shareholder s Equity (without regard to the $1 million threshold for
providing a Preliminary Objection Notice) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of
the Company at and as of such date and for such time period, respectively,
which determination shall be binding upon the parties; provided, however,
that in the event that either Buyer or Seller delivers to the other party
within five (5) business days after such determination a written notice of
its disagreement with such determination, the parties shall arbitrate such
matter in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.3 hereof.
Buyer and Seller agree that in the event the Closing Audit Report does not
indicate discrepancies between the Company Financial Statements and the
Closing Audit Report in excess of the thresholds set forth in Section 8.1(c)
hereof, then the Closing shall occur in accordance with Section 2.1 hereof
(without regard to clause (iii) of such Section) prior to the finalization
of the Closing Audit Report as contemplated by this Section 1.3(d). In the
event the Closing occurs prior to completion and acceptance of the Closing
Audit Report pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and, as a result
of the dispute procedures set forth in this Section 1.3(d), the actual
Purchase Price is determined to be greater or less than the Purchase Price
paid at Closing, a payment in the amount of such difference shall be made
within two (2) business days of such final determination by Buyer or Seller,
as the case may be, to the other party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by such other party. Notwith-
standing anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.3(d), neither
Buyer nor Seller shall be entitled to dispute the adjustments reflected in
the Closing Audit Report with respect to the calculation of (i) pension
accruals or (ii) adjustments related to all intercompany management fees.

(e) Promptly after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than thirty (30) days thereafter, Buyer shall cause the Company to deliver
simultaneously to Buyer and Seller the Company's determination of the
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) of the Company for the period beginning on
December 1, 1993 to and including the last day of that calendar month which
ends immediately prior to Closing (the "Interim Period ), together with the
workpapers used in the preparation thereof. The Company shall also instruct
the Auditor to deliver at such time a certification of the Auditor stating
that, based solely upon its review of the workpapers of the Company used in
the preparation thereof and upon any other materials deemed necessary or
relevant by the Auditor in connection therewith, nothing has come to the
Auditor's attention indicating that such determination does not comply with
the provisions of Section 1.3(c) hereof (an Auditor s Review Certifica-
tion ). The procedures set forth in Section 1.3(d) hereof shall govern the
acceptance and finality of the determination of the Adjusted Net Income
(Loss) of the Company with respect to the Interim Period, except that the
disputed item threshold shall not be applicable.

(f) All fees and expenses relating to the work to be per-
formed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne by Seller.

1.4 Retention of Certain Liabilities by Seller. Seller hereby
agrees that Seller and Seller s successors and assigns shall bear all
responsibility for all Claims (as defined in Section 9.1(a) hereof) that
GFC, Buyer, the Company and each Company Subsidiary may suffer, sustain,
incur or become subject to, arising out of, in connection with or due to any
and all acts or omissions prior to the Closing, whether known or unknown, of
every kind whatsoever (including, without limitation, Claims with respect to
those matters referred to in Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule) other
than (i) liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries at and as of November 30, 1993
contained in the Closing Audit Report, (ii) liabilities specifically identi-
fied and assumed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) claims for
refunds of customer credit balances which have been classified or treated as
income by the Company after the Closing (provided that Seller shall not be
liable to Buyer hereunder for claims for refunds brought by customers of the
Company for customer credit balances to the extent of the amount of customer
credit balances existing at and as of the Closing), (iv) Environmental
Claims (as defined in Section 3.16 hereof) except to the extent covered by
the representations and warranties contained herein; provided, however, that
Seller shall bear all responsibility for any and all Environmental Claims
with respect to all real property owned or leased by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary prior to Closing, (v) the first $350,000 of expenses of
retention of legal counsel, court fees and other legal costs and expenses
incurred in connection with conducting the defense of Claims relating solely
to loan portfolio account collection and foreclosure matters and bankruptcy
preference claims (collectively, Loan Portfolio Matters ) and of complying
with the provisions of Section 5.17 hereof in each of the three (3) twelve
(12) month periods immediately following the Closing Date, (vi) the first
$500,000 of costs and expenses incurred in connection with adverse judgments
or settlements on the part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with re-
spect to Claims relating solely to Loan Portfolio Matters in each of the
four (4) twelve (12) month periods immediately following the Closing Date;
provided, that such $500,000 annual basket shall not apply with respect to
any finding of liability or settlement with respect to Claims insofar as
such Claims relate to (a) the violation of any federal, state, local or
foreign statute, rule, regulation, ordinance or code or, with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary specifically, any order, judgment, writ,
injunction, decree or award entered by any federal, state, local or foreign
court, arbitrator or other forum of competent jurisdiction, or (b) the
enforceability, completeness and accuracy of documentation pertaining to any
such Loan Portfolio Matter; provided further, that any unapplied portion of

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

3.1 Corporate Organization, Etc. Seller is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Rhode Island and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted and own and lease its properties,
including the Company Common Stock. The Company is a corporation duly orga-
nized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Rhode Island and has full corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and to own the properties and assets
it now owns and is duly qualified or otherwise authorized as a foreign
corporation to conduct the business conducted by it and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which such qualification or authorization is
required under applicable law, except jurisdictions in which the Company s
failure to be so qualified or otherwise authorized would not or could not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in an
adverse change of $350,000 or more in the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), assets, liabilities or results of operations (a Material
Adverse Effect ) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction
in which the Company is duly qualified or otherwise authorized as a foreign
corporation to conduct business. Seller has delivered to Buyer complete and
correct copies of the charter and by-laws of each of Seller, the Company and
each Company Subsidiary as presently in effect.

3.2 Capital Stock. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 8,000 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of
which only the Company Common Stock is issued and outstanding, and no other
shares of any other class or series of capital stock are authorized, issued
or outstanding. All of the shares of Company Common Stock have been validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no
subscriptions, options, convertible or exchangeable securities or
instruments, warrants, calls, rights, contracts, commitments,
understandings, restrictions or arrangements relating to or providing for
the issuance, sale, purchase, redemption, transfer or voting of any shares
of Company Common Stock or other capital stock or ownership interests in the
Company.

3.3 Ownership of Stock. Seller has good, valid and marketable
title to the Company Common Stock free and clear of all Encumbrances, other
than the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws. Upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer will acquire
good and valid title to the Company Common Stock, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than the restrictions imposed by federal and state
securities laws.

3.4 Subsidiaries. Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth the name, jurisdiction of incorporation and capitalization of each
Company Subsidiary and each jurisdiction in which each Company Subsidiary is
duly qualified to conduct business. Except for security interests in
collateral consisting of capital stock or other equity securities of any
corporation (including, but not limited to, a cooperative corporation) or in
any partnership, joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization or any
other entity or as disclosed in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock or other equity securities of any corporation or has any
direct or indirect equity or ownership interest in any partnership, joint
venture, corporation, trust, unincorporated organization, or any other
entity not listed in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Schedule. All the out-
standing capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is owned directly or
indirectly by the Company (as set forth in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure
Schedule) free and clear of all Encumbrances, and is validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no subscrip-
tions, options, convertible or exchangeable securities or instruments, war-
rants, calls, rights, contracts, commitments, understandings, restrictions
or arrangements relating to or providing for the issuance, sale, purchase
redemption, transfer or voting of any shares of capital stock or other
ownership interests in any Company Subsidiary. Each Company Subsidiary is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its state of incorporation, has full corporate power and authority
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own the
properties and assets it now owns, and is duly qualified or otherwise autho-
rized as a foreign corporation to conduct the business conducted by it and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification or
authorization is required under applicable law, except jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified or otherwise authorized would not or
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. On January 6, 1994, the Company dissolved Flamb Corporation, a
former Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
( Flamb ). Immediately prior to such dissolution, Flamb was a shell
corporation with no assets or liabilities of any consequence. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary retains any liability as a result of the
prior ownership or operations of Flamb or as a result of its dissolution.

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of Seller has
authorized the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and no
shareholder approval or other corporate proceedings on the part of Seller is
necessary to approve and authorize the execution and delivery by Seller of

relating to creditors rights generally and (b) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

hereby will not (a) conflict with or result in a violation of any provision
of the charter or bylaws of Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary,

constitute a breach or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or

tion under, or otherwise impair, any license, permit, order, consent,

each Contract set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. Each
Contract set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (and each
other material Contract to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party) is (A) valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with its terms against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and, to the best knowledge of each Attributable Person after due
inquiry, is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms
against the other parties thereto, in each case except that such enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights
generally and the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought,
and (B) except as otherwise noted in Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, is in full force and effect without any default thereunder by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the best knowledge of each
Attributable Person after due inquiry, by any other party thereto, except to
the extent that such default or failure to be valid, binding and enforceable
would not or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as otherwise set forth in Section
3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, none of Seller, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has received written notice of any claim or charge that
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has breached any Contract, including
those set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Each currently existing factoring arrangement and each
currently outstanding loan or extension of credit by the Company and each
Company Subsidiary (each, a Credit Arrangement ) was solicited, originated
and serviced and currently exists in full compliance with all applicable
requirements of Law, except where the failure to so comply would not or
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. Each note and instrument evidencing a Credit Arrangement and
each loan agreement, credit agreement and security instrument related to
each Credit Arrangement constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation of
the obligor thereunder, enforceable in accordance with the terms thereof,
except where the failure thereof would not or could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company and Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as
set forth in Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, each Credit Ar-
rangement is documented to accurately reflect the terms of such Credit Ar-
rangement and there are no oral modifications or amendments or additional
agreements related to any Credit Arrangement that are not reflected in the
records (including in the general financial reporting, factoring and loan
administration systems of the Company) of the Company or any Company Subsid-
iary which established or services such Credit Arrangement. Except with
respect to counterclaims raised in connection with legal actions initiated
by the Company as set forth in Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule, no
claims of defense as to the enforcement of any Credit Arrangement have been
asserted, nor would any act or omission on the part of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary give rise to any claim or right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense, except in each case where such modifications,
amendments, agreements, claims, defenses, acts or omissions would not or
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. Seller does not make any representation or warranty to Buyer as
to the collectibility of amounts owing under any of the Credit Arrangements
to the extent that such failure or inability to collect arises out of the
insolvency or bankruptcy of customers or borrowers or the inability of
customers or borrowers to pay. Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule

annual volume summary (in the case of factoring arrangements), (ii) the

Subsidiary or affect or relate to the ownership, use or operations of any of
the properties of any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as

default with respect to any provision of any insurance policy issued for its

of the Disclosure Schedule, there is no claim, action, suit, inquiry,
proceeding, arbitration or investigation by or before any court or

of each Attributable Person after due inquiry, threatened, against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, where the amount sought to be recovered
is in excess of $100,000 (or is unspecified) or in which punitive or
multiple damages or injunctive relief is being sought. Except as set forth
in Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule, none of Seller, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has received any written, or, to the best knowledge
of each Attributable Person after due inquiry, any other, notice of any
claim or assertion of liability on the part of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, the realization of which would or could reasonably be expected

Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(f) There exists no facility in which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary participates in or may be deemed to participate in the
management (as that term has been defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency in its recently vacated rule found at 40
C.F.R. 300.1100(c) (1993)) based exclusively upon acts or events which occur

and regulations promulgated thereunder ( ERISA ), for the benefit of any em-
ployee or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, whether
formal or informal and whether legally binding or not (the Plans ).
Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each of the Plans that
is an employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan, as
such terms are defined in sections 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA (such plans being
hereinafter referred to collectively as the ERISA Plans ). Except as

Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has any formal plan
or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional Plan
or modify or change any existing Plan that would affect any employee or
terminated or retired employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
is not required by Law.

(b) With respect to each of the Plans, Seller has heretofore
delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of each of the following

by Seller, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate since
the effective date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to any such party of
incurring a liability under such Title, other than liability for premiums
due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC ), which payments have
been or will be made when due. To the extent this representation applies to
sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it is made not only with
respect to the ERISA Plans but also with respect to any employee benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to

to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of accrued benefits under such Plan,
based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most
recent actuarial report prepared by such Plan's actuary with respect to such
Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits.

(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, any of
the ERISA Plans, any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or adminis-
trator thereof has engaged in a transaction or has taken or failed to take
any action in connection with which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 409
or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to section 4975, 4976 or 4980B
of the Code.

(g) Full payment has been made, or will be made in
accordance with section 404(a)(6) of the Code, of all amounts which Seller,
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is required to
pay under the terms of each of the ERISA Plans and section 412 of the Code,
and all such amounts properly accrued through the Closing with respect to
the current plan year thereof will be paid, or be caused to be paid, by
Seller on or prior to the Closing or will be properly recorded on the
Closing Audit Report; and none of the ERISA Plans or any trust established
thereunder has incurred any accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in
section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as
of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of each of the ERISA Plans
ended prior to the date of this Agreement.

(h) None of the ERISA plans is a multiemployer plan, as
such term is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA.

(i) Each of the Plans has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with applicable Laws, including but not
limited to ERISA and the Code.

period.

(k) Each of the ERISA Plans that is intended to satisfy the
requirements of section 501(c)(9) of the Code has so satisfied such require-
ments.

(l) No amounts payable under the Plans will fail to be
deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of section 280G of the
Code.

(m) No leased employee, as that term is defined in section
414(n) of the Code, performs services for the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

(n) No Plan provides benefits, including without limitation
death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current
or former employees after retirement or other termination of service (other
than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or
retirement benefits under any employee pension benefit plan, as that term
is defined in section 3(2) of ERISA, (iii) deferred compensation benefits
accrued as liabilities on the Company Financial Statements and the books of
Seller, the Company, a Company Subsidiary or the ERISA Affiliates, or
(iv) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former
employee (or his beneficiary).

(o) With respect to each Plan that is funded wholly or
partially through an insurance policy, there will be no liability of Seller,
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate, as of the Closing
Date, under any such insurance policy or ancillary agreement with respect to
such insurance policy in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss
sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly
or partially out of events occurring prior to the Closing Date.

Company and Company Subsidiaries for any taxable year or taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date due or payable with respect to the

Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date, including any Taxes resulting
from the making of the Section 338 Elections and any liability for Taxes

amount of Taxes currently payable that have been reserved for on the Audit
Date balance sheet included in the Closing Audit Report. Seller shall
determine the amount of taxable income of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries for the taxable year ending on the Closing Date on the basis of
its permanent records (including workpapers) in a manner consistent with

Section 338 Elections.

(f) Taxable Periods Commencing On or Before the Closing Date
and Ending After the Closing Date. Any Taxes for a taxable period beginning

ing Period ) with respect to the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall be
apportioned between Seller and Buyer based on the actual operations of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries during the portion of such period ending on
the Closing Date (the Pre-Closing Period ) and the portion of such period
beginning on the day following the Closing Date but with Seller bearing the
effect of all Section 338 Elections, and for purposes of subsections (d),
(e), and (g) of this Section 5.5, each portion of such period shall be
deemed to be a taxable period. With respect to any Taxes for the Closing
Period:

(i) at least thirty days prior to the due date for
the payment of Taxes with respect to the Closing Period, Buyer
shall present Seller with a schedule detailing the computation of
the Pre-Closing Period Tax;

(ii) twenty-five (25) days after Buyer presents
Seller with the schedule described in clause (i) above, Seller
shall pay the Company and Company Subsidiaries the amount of the
undisputed Pre-Closing Period Tax as computed by Buyer to the
extent such Taxes have not been reserved for on the Audit Date
balance sheet included in the Closing Audit Report, and Buyer
shall pay all other Taxes with respect to the Closing Period; and

(iii) in the event Seller disputes Buyer s compu-
tation of the Pre-Closing Period Tax or any of the payments de-
scribed in clause (ii) above, Seller shall not be required to pay
any disputed amount requested pending the resolution of such
dispute in accordance with subsection (j) of this Section 5.5. If
upon such resolution it is determined that any of such disputed
amount is payable to Buyer and such disputed amount payable to
Buyer has not been paid to Buyer as of the expiration of the
period described in clause (ii) above (the Due Date ), Seller
shall pay to Buyer, in addition to such disputed amount payable to
Buyer, interest computed thereon at the applicable federal rate
for large corporate underpayments (within the meaning of Section
6621 of the Code) in effect from time to time from the Due Date to
the date of payment.

(g) Refunds or Credits. Except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, any refunds or credits of Taxes, to the extent that such
refunds or credits are attributable to taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date and are in excess of those reflected on the Audit Date
balance sheet included in the Closing Audit Report, shall be for the account
of Seller, and, to the extent that such refunds or credits are attributable
to taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date or are reflected on the
Audit Date balance sheet included in the Closing Audit Report, such refunds
or credits shall be for the account of Buyer. To the extent that such
refunds or credits are attributable to Taxes for the Closing Period that are
described in Section 5.5(f), such refunds and credits shall be for the
account of the party who bears responsibility for such Taxes pursuant to
Section 5.5(f). Buyer shall cause the Company and Company Subsidiaries
promptly to forward to Seller or to reimburse Seller for any such refunds or
credits due Seller pursuant to this subsection (g) after receipt thereof by
any of Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary of an aggregate of at
least $10,000 of such refunds or credits that are for the account of Seller
hereunder, and Seller shall promptly forward to Buyer or reimburse Buyer for
any refunds or credits due Buyer after receipt thereof by Seller of an
aggregate of at least $10,000 of such refunds or credits that are for the
account of Buyer hereunder; provided, however, that the refunding party
shall be entitled to deduct from the amount to be refunded all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by such refunding party in obtaining such
refund, but such deduction shall not be included in calculating whether the
$10,000 refund and credit threshold noted above has been reached.

(h) Mutual Cooperation. As soon as practicable, but in any
event within fifteen (15) days after Seller s or Buyer s request, as the
case may be, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, or Seller shall deliver to
Buyer, as the case may be, such information and other data relating to the
Tax Returns and Taxes of the Company and Company Subsidiaries and shall make
available such knowledgeable employees of Seller, Buyer, the Company or
Company Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, as the case may be, as
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, may reasonably request, including
providing the information and other data customarily required by Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, to cause the completion and filing of all Tax
Returns for which it has responsibility or liability under this Agreement or
to respond to audits by any Taxing Authorities with respect to any Tax
Returns or Taxes for which it has any responsibility or liability under this
Agreement or to otherwise enable Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, to
satisfy its accounting or tax requirements. Notwithstanding Sections 5.3(b)
and 5.7 hereof, for a period of seven years from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and Company Subsidiaries to,
maintain and make available to Seller on Seller s reasonable request, and
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain and make available
to Buyer, on Buyer s reasonable request, copies of any and all information,
books and records referred to in this Section 5.5(h). After such seven-year
period, Seller, Buyer or the Company and Company Subsidiaries may dispose of
such information, books and records, provided that prior to such disposition
the other party hereto shall be offered the opportunity to take possession
of such information, books and records.

(i) Contests. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a
claim, makes an assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for
which Seller is or may be liable under this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly
inform Seller and Seller shall have the right to control any resulting
proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such claim,
assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations would
materially affect the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable under this
Agreement. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assess-
ment or otherwise disputes the amount of taxes for which Buyer is liable

other in an effort to resolve such dispute. If any such point of
disagreement cannot be resolved within fifteen (15) days of the date of
consultation, Seller and Buyer shall within ten (10) days after such 15-day
period jointly engage an auditor (other than the Auditor or Deloitte &
Touche) (the Tax Auditor ) to act as an arbitrator to resolve all points of
disagreement concerning tax accounting matters with respect to this Agree-
ment. If the parties cannot agree on the selection of a Tax Auditor within
such 10-day period, then the matter shall be resolved pursuant to Section
9.3, except that the arbitrator shall be an attorney or certified public
accountant proficient in relevant Tax matters. All fees and expenses

period at its expense make such copies thereof as it may reasonably request.

5.8 Supplements to Disclosure Schedule; Notice and Cure.

(a) From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer
will promptly supplement or amend the sections of the Disclosure Schedule
relating to their respective representations and warranties in this
Agreement with respect to any matter, condition or occurrence hereafter
arising which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in their respective sections
of the Disclosure Schedule or would otherwise have been inconsistent with
their representations set forth in this Agreement. No supplement or amend-
ment by either party shall be deemed to cure (or affect the rights of any
party with respect to) any breach of any representation or warranty made in
this Agreement or have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Articles VI or VII hereof.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall inform the other in writing of,
and contemporaneously with such notice will provide to the other true and
complete copies of all information and documents relating to, any event,
transaction or circumstance occurring after the date hereof that causes or
is reasonably likely to cause any of its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement to be breached or that renders or is reasonably likely to render
untrue any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement.
Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cure, before
the Closing, (a) any such breach or misrepresentation by it and (b) any
violation or breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements in this Agreement, whether occurring or arising before or after
the date hereof.

5.9 Covenant to Satisfy Conditions. Seller and Buyer agree to
use all reasonable efforts to assure that the conditions to the other
party s obligations hereunder set forth in Article VI and Article VII hereof
are satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control of such party.

5.10 Employee Benefits and Employment.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section 5.10, the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall cease to partici-
pate in the Plans as of the Closing Date, and the Company and Company
Subsidiaries shall have no liability thereunder subsequent to such date.
Seller shall be liable for all obligations to employees, former employees,
participants, and their respective dependents and beneficiaries arising
under said Plans, including any obligations for severance under any
severance plan, policy or Contract, on or before the Closing Date or which
arise due to the sale of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms
hereof. Buyer shall be obligated to pay severance to any Employee (as
defined below) whose employment with the Company is terminated by the
Company other than for cause during the six-month period immediately
following the Closing. In the event that severance benefits payable under
the Buyer Plans (as defined below) for such six-month period to any
Employees who are terminated subsequent to the Closing is less in amount
than the severance benefits such Employees would have been entitled to under
the Plans, then Buyer shall cause the Company to supplement the amounts
payable under Buyer Plans to the extent necessary such that the total
severance benefits paid to each such Employee for such period equals the
amount which such Employees would have received under the Plans. There
shall be no transfer of assets from any Plan to Buyer or any employee
benefit plan maintained by Buyer, and Buyer shall have no right, title or
interest in or liability under any Plan except as otherwise provided in
paragraph (c) of this Section 5.10.

(b) Each employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (each, an Employee ) shall be eligible for
participation in the employee welfare benefit plans and the employee
pension benefit plans, as such terms are defined in sections 3(1) and 3(2)
of ERISA, maintained by Buyer and as in effect from time to time (the Buyer
Plans ). The Employees shall be subject to any eligibility conditions con-
tained in the Buyer Plans, except that with respect to life, health and
dental plans, Employees participating in Seller medical plans immediately
prior to the Closing Date and not subject to the preexisting condition
exclusions of such plans shall not be subject to the preexisting condition
exclusions of such Buyer Plans. Each Employee shall receive full credit for
past service to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the purposes of
satisfying any eligibility requirements and vesting requirements of the
Buyer Plans and for purposes of determining employer contributions under
Buyer's Retiree Medical Insurance Plan (but not for benefit accrual or
calculation purposes under any plans other than Buyer's Retiree Medical
Insurance Plan) to the extent such service is recognized for such purpose
under the comparable Plan. Buyer shall give each Employee credit towards
the deductible on Buyer s medical and dental plans to the extent such pay-
ments were made to a comparable Plan by such Employee during 1994 for
expenses incurred during 1994. Buyer shall have no liability or obligation
under any employment, consulting or severance arrangements established by
Seller. Seller shall give Employees credit for their post-Closing service
with the Company and Company Subsidiaries under Buyer's Pension Plan for
vesting, but not for accruing additional benefits, and Buyer shall provide
appropriate employment information to allow Seller to do so.

(c) Seller shall amend its Savings Plan to permit Employees
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are participants in Seller's
Savings Plan, in their discretion, and in accordance with Treas. Reg.
1.411(d)-4Q&A3(b) and other applicable law, to receive a distribution of
their account balances in such plan or to make a direct transfer thereof to
Buyer's Savings Plan. Seller shall offer to lend to any such Employee who
elects to make a direct rollover to Buyer's Savings Plan and whose account
is subject to an outstanding loan as of the Closing Date an amount equal to
the balance of such outstanding loan for a period of ninety (90) days after
such transfer, and Buyer shall make loans available from its Savings Plan
within said period to enable the Employee to repay Seller. Any shares of
Seller stock included in an account balance rolled over to Buyer's Savings
Plan shall be held in a separate investment account thereunder and may,
within two (2) years of the Closing Date, be transferred to another
investment option within Buyer's Savings Plan. Buyer and Seller agree to
cooperate as reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 5.10(c).

(d) Seller shall continue to carry Employees on its payroll
and provide them with health and dental benefits in accordance with their
existing elections until the end of the month in which the Closing occurs,
at which time they shall be transferred to Buyer's payroll and health and
dental plans. For the period beginning with the Closing and ending with the
end of the month in which the Closing occurs, Buyer shall hold Seller harm-
less and reimburse it for (i) all payroll expenses, including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, wages, payroll taxes and worker's
compensation premiums with respect to the employment of Employees after the
Closing, and (ii) all liabilities and obligations of Seller for health and
dental benefits and administration expenses payable under Seller's plans
relating to health and dental services provided to Employees and their
dependents after the Closing.

5.11 Company Name. (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not conduct business under the
name Fleet Factors Corp. or any other name incorporating the word Fleet;
nor shall Buyer use in any manner the Fleet logos or service marks currently
used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be permitted to use
any such name, logos and service marks (i) in connection with collection and
legal proceedings involving Credit Arrangements established on or prior to
the Closing Date, (ii) in announcements of the transaction distributed to
current or former customers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
otherwise, (iii) on any document or other materials used in the operation of
the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including,
without limitation, sales material, forms of agreements, invoices,
letterhead and business cards in existence on the Closing Date, until deple-
tion, but in no event after the first anniversary of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not at any time be obligated
hereunder to amend Credit Arrangement documents (including financing state-
ments or similar documents) to alter the Company s name or any name under
which the Company conducts or has conducted business or otherwise. From and
after the Closing, Buyer, the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall have
the unrestricted right to use the name Ambassador Factors and the names
set forth in Section 5.11 of the Disclosure Schedule.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall
not permit Seller s Affiliates to, conduct business under or otherwise use
the names Ambassador or Ambassador Factors or any other name incorporat-
ing such words.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to
change the Company s name to Ambassador Factors Corp.

5.12 Covenant Not to Compete. (a) To more effectively transfer
and protect the business and goodwill of the Company and the Company Subsid-
iaries, Seller agrees that, for a period beginning immediately after the
Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary thereof, neither Seller nor
any current or future Affiliate of Seller will, without Buyer's prior
written consent (i) directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, participate
in, perform marketing, servicing or sales services for or otherwise carry on
in a business providing the services currently provided by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in any state in the United States or (ii) directly or
indirectly solicit any current employee of Buyer, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to pursue employment opportunities other than with Buyer, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing clause
(i), Seller shall not be prohibited from (i) acquiring any bank or bank
holding company owning a factoring affiliate providing not more than 25% of
such acquired bank or bank holding company s revenue on a consolidated basis
in the year preceding such acquisition, (ii) acquiring any Person which
generated less than 25% of such Person s revenue by factoring accounts
receivable in any of the three years preceding such acquisition,
(iii) participating in asset-based financing transactions in the ordinary
course of business, (iv) participating in accounts receivable financing
transactions in the ordinary course of business, or (v) participating in
occasional factoring transactions entered into in connection with the
ordinary course of Seller s business. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Seller nor Seller's Affiliates shall engage in activities otherwise
permitted by this Section 5.12 with existing or prospective customers of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, all of which are identified in Section
5.12 of the Disclosure Schedule, or with any Employee, except for
participations with those two customers specifically designated in Section
5.12 of the Disclosure Schedule at levels not to exceed participation levels
as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 5.12, a
court shall hold that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein
are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, Buyer and Seller agree
that the maximum duration, scope or area permissible under such
circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area,
it being agreed by the parties that the covenant set forth in the first
clause (i) above constitutes a separate and independent covenant with
respect to each state of the United States.

(c) Seller acknowledges that Buyer has no adequate remedy at
law and would be irreparably harmed were Seller to breach or threaten to
breach the provisions of this Section 5.12, and therefore agrees that in
addition to any other legal or equitable remedy it may have, the Company
shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any breach or threatened
breach of this Section 5.12.

5.13 Confidentiality. Each party hereto will hold and will
cause its officers, directors, employees, consultants, advisors and other
agents to hold in strict confidence, unless compelled to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of its counsel, by
other requirements of Law (collectively, Legal Requirements ), all
confidential documents and information concerning the other party furnished
it by such other party or its representatives in connection with the trans-
actions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the extent that such
information (i) is or was previously known by the party to which it was fur-
nished, (ii) is or becomes in the public domain through no fault of such
party, or (iii) is later lawfully acquired from other sources by the party
to which it was furnished), and each party will not release or disclose such
information to any other person, except its auditors, attorneys, financial
advisors and other consultants and advisors in connection with this
Agreement (unless compelled to so disclose by Legal Requirements) and shall
not use such information other than in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby until after the Closing Date. If the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, such
confidence shall be maintained to the extent required above, and such infor-
mation shall not be used to the detriment of, or in relation to any
investment in, the other party and all such documents (including copies
thereof) shall be returned to the other party immediately upon the written
request of such other party. Each party shall be deemed to have satisfied
its obligation to hold confidential information concerning or supplied by
the other party if it exercises the same care as it takes to preserve con-
fidentiality for its own similar information.

5.14 Employment Agreement. Seller shall have the opportunity
prior to Closing to review the employment agreement required by Section 7.9
hereof (the Employment Agreement ).

5.15 Certain Other Obligations. Seller hereby agrees to perform
each obligation of Seller set forth in that certain letter agreement dated
November 29, 1993 by and among GFC, Seller, the Company and Mr. Howard
Rubin.

company liabilities other than intercompany debt as referred to in Section

Interim Period and owed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to Seller
or any Seller Affiliate (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary)
shall be paid to Seller at the time of the payment of the Adjusted Net
Income (Loss) of the Company for the Interim Period. An Auditor's Review
Certification shall be delivered with respect to the determination of such
amount.

after the Closing Date it will cause itself or the Company to be substituted
for, or will replace, Seller with respect to those three (3) appeal bonds
set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all costs and expenses
and other Claims arising in connection with the provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the $350,000 annual
threshold described in Section 1.4(v) hereof.

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Indemnification. (a) Seller agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold Buyer and Buyer s Affiliates including, after the Closing Date, the
Company and each Company Subsidiary and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, counsel and other representatives (each, a
Buyer Indemnified Party ), harmless from and against and in respect of:
(i) any and all losses, liabilities, Taxes, damages, deficiencies, demands,
claims, costs and expenses (including interest, penalties, fees and reason-
able attorneys and experts' fees and expenses incurred in connection with
any of the foregoing and in seeking indemnification hereunder) (collec-
tively, Claims ) that they may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to,
arising out of, in connection with or due to any inaccuracy of any
representation or the breach of any warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule), in each case without regard
to any materiality, or Material Adverse Effect or similar limitations,
thresholds or exceptions contained in such representations and warranties
and without regard to whether any such action giving rise to a Claim is
initiated prior to or after the Closing, provided, that Seller shall not be
required to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party for Claims under this clause
(i) unless and until the aggregate value of such Claims exceeds $250,000;
(ii) all Claims with respect to the breach of any covenant, undertaking or
other agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement; (iii) all Claims
relating to Retained Liabilities, even in the event that such obligations
and liabilities are or may be covered by representations or warranties; (iv)
all customer credit balances classified or treated as income prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable for indemnifica-
tion pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(iv) with respect to claims for refunds
brought by customers of the Company for customer credit balances to the
extent of the amount of customer credit balances existing at and as of the
Closing; and (v) all Claims with respect to the failure to obtain or make
any consent, approval, authorization, notice, declaration, filing or
registration set forth in Section 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule. Notwith-
standing anything to the contrary contained in clause (i) of this Section
9.1, Seller shall not be required to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party for
any misstatement of any line item in the financial statements contained in
the Closing Audit Report if such misstatement related to the overstatement
of an asset line item by no more than $500,000 or if such misstatement
related to the understatement of a liability line item by no more than
$500,000, unless in either case any Attributable Person had knowledge before
Closing of such overstatement or understatement.

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller,
Seller s Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, counsel and other representatives (each, a Seller Indemnified
Party ), harmless from and against and in respect of: (i) any and all
Claims that they may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to arising out
of, in connection with or due to any inaccuracy of any representation or the
breach of any warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement, in each case
without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar
limitations, thresholds or exceptions contained in such representations and
warranties and without regard to whether any such action giving rise to a
Claim is initiated prior to or after the Closing; provided, that Buyer shall
not be required to indemnify a Seller Indemnified Party under this clause
(i) unless and until the aggregate value of such Claims exceeds $250,000;
and (ii) all Claims with respect to the breach of any covenant, undertaking
or other agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

(c) With respect to breaches of representations and warran-
ties only, the indemnification provided pursuant to Section 9.1(a) (i) and
Section 9.1(b) shall in each case be limited to the Purchase Price as
adjusted pursuant to Section 1.3(f) hereof (the Indemnity Limit ).
Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable for breaches of representations and
warranties for amounts in excess of the Indemnity Limit.

(d) Except as provided in Section 9.1(e), if there occurs an
event which a party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section
9.1(a) or 9.1(b), the Buyer Indemnified Party or, as the case may be, the
Seller Indemnified Party (each an Indemnified Party ) shall notify the
other party obligated to provide indemnification (the Indemnifying Party )
promptly; provided, that the failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent
that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If
such event involves the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third
person, the Indemnified Party will give such Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice of the commencement of such action or proceeding; provided,
however, that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to
the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party
hereunder. In case any such action shall be brought against any Indemnified
Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement
thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein
and, to the extent that it shall elect to do so in writing within 10 days
after such notice, to assume the defense thereof, at its sole cost and
expense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party
(provided that the Indemnifying Party first agrees in writing to pay the
full amount of indemnification with respect to such action to the
Indemnified Party, and further provided that Seller shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any action brought against any Indemnified Party
identified in Section 9.1(a) by any federal, state, local or foreign govern-
mental agency or authority). After notice from the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party of such election so to assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own separate counsel,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the Indemnified
Party s expense unless (a) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall have agreed to the contrary, (b) the Indemnifying Party has failed
within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, or (c) the named party in any such proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel
could be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them. In any matter described above where the Indemnified Party has
obtained counsel to represent it in addition to counsel obtained by the
Indemnifying Party, counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party shall be
required to cooperate fully with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party
in such matter. So long as the Indemnifying Party is defending in good
faith any claim for which indemnification is sought, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any claim settled without its consent, which consent
may not be unreasonable withheld.

(e) (i) In the event of a Claim by a third Person relating
to Loan Portfolio Matters, which Claim could reasonably be likely to relate
to pre-Closing periods, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall give Seller prompt
written notice of such Claim (whether such Claim involves the commencement
of an action or proceeding, a counterclaim or otherwise); provided, however,
that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will not
relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that such
failure actually prejudices Seller hereunder. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 9.1(d) hereof, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to conduct the defense of any such Claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Seller. The defense of any such Claim shall be at the sole
cost and expense of Seller, subject to the provisions of Section 1.4(v)
hereof. Seller shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
such Claim and to retain its own separate counsel with respect thereto (and
to assume the defense of any such Claim in the event that the Buyer
Indemnified Party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Seller), but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, subject to the provisions
of Section 1.4 hereof. In any matter described above where Seller has
obtained counsel to represent it in addition to counsel obtained by the
Buyer Indemnified Party, counsel selected by the Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be required to cooperate fully with counsel selected by Seller.

(ii) Subject to Section 1.4(vi) hereof, in the event of
an adverse judgment or settlement on the part of a Buyer Indemnified Party
with respect to Claims referred to in the first sentence of Section 9.1(e)
hereof, the Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller promptly shall negotiate in
good faith their respective shares of the cost and expense of such resulting
liability or settlement based on the extent to which the liability or
settlement relates to a Retained Liability(ies). No such settlement shall
be effected by any party without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Seller shall not be
entitled to assert inadequate representation as a defense to the sharing of
any such liability or settlement, and neither party shall be entitled to
call into question the validity of any finding by the relevant court,
arbitrator or other forum of competent jurisdiction as a defense to the
sharing of any such liability. In the event the parties do not agree how to
share the costs and expenses of any such liability or settlement within
sixty (60) days thereof, then the parties shall promptly, but in no event
later than thirty (30) business days after the end of such sixty (60) day
period, submit such matter for determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in New York,
New York. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

9.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The repre-
sentations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing Date
and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter until two years after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.3, the third sentence of Section 3.4, and Section
3.16 shall survive indefinitely without limitation and the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.11 and 3.17 shall survive until the
applicable statutes of limitations have run. No action or proceeding may be
brought with respect to any Claims based on the breach of a representation
or warranty unless written notice thereof, setting forth in reasonable
detail each such Claim, shall have been delivered to the Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, prior to the expiration of the applicable periods set forth
above.

9.3 Arbitration.
(a) All controversies or Claims arising among
the parties, including without limitation claims arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the subject matter hereof, any other Contract among such
Persons, and the arbitrability of any Claim, but excluding those matters
that are governed by Sections 5.5(j) and 9.1(e) hereof, shall be settled by
arbitration as provided below. The arbitration and all preliminary proceed-
ings related thereto shall be conducted in accordance with such rules as may
be agreed upon by the parties, or, failing agreement on such rules, in
accordance with the Rules for Commercial Arbitration of the American
Arbitration Association ( AAA ), as amended from time to time and as
modified by this Agreement. The dispute shall be presented to a single
arbitrator sitting in New York City.

(b) The arbitrator shall be selected jointly by the parties
within fifteen (15) days after demand for arbitration is made by a party.
If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within that period, then
any party may request that the AAA select the arbitrator. The arbitrator
shall possess substantive legal experience in the principal issues in
dispute.

(c) Any discovery permitted shall be limited to information
directly relevant to the controversy or Claim in arbitration. In the event
of discovery disputes, the arbitrator is directed to issue such orders as
are appropriate to limit discovery in accordance with the foregoing and as
are reasonable in light of the issues in dispute, the amount in controversy,
and other relevant considerations. To the extent the parties are unable to
agree on the scope of discovery, the arbitrator shall require the party
seeking discovery on an issue to present the legal and factual basis for the
Claim and shall permit the party opposing discovery to respond. The
arbitrator shall permit discovery on an issue only if the arbitrator
concludes that there is a reasonable and good faith basis in Law and in fact
for bringing such allegations and that the discovery appears likely to
present substantive evidence regarding that Claim. The arbitrator may
permit limited discovery to permit investigation of some of the Claims or to
determine whether a Claim has sufficient basis in law or in fact to warrant
further discovery, but shall issue appropriate orders to restrict the scope
of such discovery. The federal or state rules or procedure and evidence
shall not apply to the arbitration proceedings, including without limitation
the rules of discovery. The arbitrator shall consider claims of privilege,
work product and other restrictions on discovery as appear to be warranted.

(d) The arbitrator shall award the prevailing party its
attorneys and experts fees and disbursements incurred in resolving the
dispute and shall award double costs and expenses or other sanctions to the
extent the arbitrator finds any Claim advanced in the proceedings to be
frivolous or without a good faith basis in fact and in law when such Claim
was first presented for arbitration.

(e) Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by the
parties or as ordered by the arbitrator upon substantial justification
shown, the hearing for the dispute shall be held within ninety (90) days of
submission of the dispute to arbitration. The arbitrator shall render its
final award within thirty (30) days following conclusion of the hearing and
any required post-hearing briefing or other proceedings ordered by the
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall state the factual and legal basis for the
award. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, except as
provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq., and
except for errors of law based on the findings of fact. Final judgment
may be entered upon such an award in any court of competent jurisdiction,
but entry of such judgment shall not be required to make such award
effective. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in New York,
New York. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

(a) Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to the Company from time to time on
any Business Day during the period from the date hereof to but excluding the

amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the amount set opposite

aggregate of all Commitments hereunder on the Effective Date is
$700,000,000. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, the Company
may from time to time borrow, repay pursuant to Section 2.08 or prepay
pursuant to Section 2.03, and reborrow under this Section 2.01.

(b) Each Borrowing shall be (i) in the case of a Base Rate
Advance, in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $5,000,000 or, if
greater, in an aggregate principal amount which is an integral multiple of
$500,000, and (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Advance, in an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $15,000,000 or, if greater, an aggregate
principal amount which is an integral multiple of $500,000 (except that any
Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances may be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unused portion of the Total Commitments) and shall
consist of Advances of the same Type and Interest Period, in each case made
on the same day simultaneously by the Lenders ratably according to their
respective Commitments.

SECTION 2.02. The Advance Accounts. The Administrative Agent
will maintain two separate accounts, the "Base Rate Advance Account" and the
"Eurodollar Advance Account" (such accounts to be collectively called the
"Advance Accounts") for each Lender on the books of the Administrative Agent
each of which shall be in the name of the Company and of such Lender in
which, respectively, (i) the amount of each Base Rate Advance made by such
Lender shall be debited on the date such Base Rate Advance is made available
to the Company or on the date such Base Rate Advance is deemed to arise

payment is received, and (iv) each payment (including a payment deemed to
have been received pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(i)) to such Lender in respect
of a Eurodollar Advance shall be credited on the date on which payment is
received. The "Debit Balance" as of any date for a Lender in its Base Rate
Advance Account or its Eurodollar Advance Account shall be the amount equal
to the excess, if any, of all debit entries over all credit entries recorded
pursuant to this Agreement in such Advance Account in the name of such
Lender (as set forth in the Register described in Section 8.04(d)) up to and
including any date of determination thereof; provided, however that the
failure of the Administrative Agent or a Lender to make an entry in any
Advance Account shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the
Company hereunder with respect to payments of principal of or interest on
the Advances.

SECTION 2.03. Prepayments of Debit Balances.

(a) The Company shall have no right to prepay any principal
amount of any Advances other than as provided in this subsection (a). The
Company may, upon at least one Business Day's notice to the Administrative
Agent in the case of Base Rate Advances and at least three Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent in the case of Eurodollar Advances
stating the proposed date and the aggregate principal amount of the
prepayment, and if such notice is given the Company shall, prepay the
outstanding principal amounts of the Advances comprising part of the same
Borrowing in whole or ratably in part; provided, however, that (x) each
partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than
$5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and
(y) the Company shall pay all accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the portion of any Advance being prepaid and shall, in the
case of any such prepayment of any Eurodollar Advance, be obligated to
reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.13. Base
Rate Advances may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

(b)(i) The Lenders may require prepayment of the Advances and
termination of the Commitments in the manner set forth in subsection
(b)(ii) below, upon the occurrence (or, as set forth in subsection
(b)(ii) below, the proposed occurrence) of either of the following
events (the events described in clauses (x) or (y) are sometimes
hereinafter referred to as a "Change of Control"):

(x) any Person or two or more Persons acting in concert
shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of securities of GFC
Financial or the Company (or other securities convertible into
such securities) representing 25% or more of the combined voting
power of all securities of GFC Financial or the Company entitled
to vote in the election of directors, other than securities having
such power only by reason of the happening of a contingency
("Share Acquisition"); or

(y) individuals who either (1) have been directors of GFC
Financial or the Company for the prior 24-month period or (2) were
nominated or elected by directors in office during such period
(but prior to any Share Acquisition) shall cease for any reason to
constitute a majority of the board of directors of GFC Financial
or the Company.

(ii) The Company shall give prompt written notice to each
Lender ("Company Notice") of any proposed or actual Change of Control
as follows: (x) if the Company has knowledge of and the board of
directors consents to (or does not oppose) a proposed Change of
Control, the Company shall notify the Lenders of such Change of Control
not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days prior to the consummation
of the Change of Control and (y) with respect to a Change of Control to
which the Company's board of directors does not consent and opposes,
the Company shall notify the Lenders of such Change of Control
immediately after the Company receives notice of such Change of
Control. For a period of 90 days following receipt of the Company
Notice by each Lender, each Lender shall have the right by written
notice to the Company ("Lender Notice") to terminate its Commitment and
to require the Company to prepay in whole, but not in part, without
premium or penalty, all Advances of such Lender, with accrued interest
and fees to the date of such prepayment on the amount of such Advances
prepaid. The date of prepayment and termination of any Commitments
following the Company's receipt of any Lender Notices shall be
determined by the Company and shall not be less than 60 or more than 90
days after the date of receipt by the Company of the first Lender
Notice. The Company agrees to make such prepayment if so required.

SECTION 2.04. Making the Advances.

(a) Each Borrowing shall be made on notice given not later than
(i) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) in the case of a Borrowing which is to
consist of Base Rate Advances, on the Business Day of such Borrowing and
(ii) 12:00 Noon (New York City time) in the case of a Borrowing which is to
consist of Eurodollar Advances, on the third Business Day prior to such
Borrowing from the Company to the Administrative Agent (which shall give
prompt notice thereof to each Lender). Each such notice (a "Notice of
Borrowing") shall be by telex or telecopy facsimile, confirmed immediately
in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto and shall specify
(i) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the Type
of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) the aggregate amount of the
proposed Borrowing, and (iv) the Interest Period for the Advances to be made
as part of such Borrowing. Each Lender through its Applicable Lending
Office shall, before (x) in the case of a Borrowing which is to consist of a
Base Rate Advance, 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), and (y) in the case of a
Borrowing which is to consist of a Eurodollar Advance, 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available to the
Administrative Agent at its address provided for in Section 8.03 such
Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing in same day funds. Upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V and after
receipt by the Administrative Agent of such funds, the Administrative Agent
will make such funds available to the Company at the Administrative Agent's
aforesaid address.

(b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding,

(i) if any Lender shall notify (which notice shall, if given in
relation to a proposed Borrowing, be given at least one Business Day
before the date of the proposed Borrowing) the Administrative Agent
that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of
any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or
other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such
Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations
hereunder to make Eurodollar Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar
Advances hereunder, the Commitment of such Lender to make Eurodollar
Advances shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Company that such Lender has determined that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and such Lender's
then outstanding Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be converted to
Base Rate Advances; to the extent that such affected Eurodollar
Advances become Base Rate Advances, all payments of principal that
would have been otherwise applied to such Eurodollar Advances shall be
applied instead to such Lender's Base Rate Advances; provided that if
Majority Lenders are subject to the same illegality or assertion of
illegality, then the right of the Company to select Eurodollar Advances
for such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing shall forthwith be
suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company that
the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each
Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate
Advance;

(ii) if fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information
to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.07 for determining
the LIBO Rate for Eurodollar Advances comprising any requested
Borrowing, the right of the Company to select Eurodollar Advances for
such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance
comprising such Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Advance;
and

(iii) if the Majority Lenders shall, at least one Business Day
before the date of any requested Borrowing, notify the Administrative
Agent that the LIBO Rate for Eurodollar Advances comprising such
Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders
of making or funding their respective Eurodollar Advances for such
Borrowing, the right of the Company to select Eurodollar Advances for
such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance
comprising such Borrowing shall be converted to a Base Rate Advance.

(c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on
the Company and, in respect of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Advances
specified in any such notice, the Company shall, in accordance with Section
2.13, indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense incurred by such
Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified
for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article V,
including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated
profits) or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund the Advance to be
made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result
of such failure, is not made on such date.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a
Lender before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the Business Day of the
making of a Base Rate Advance and 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) one
Business Day prior to the date of the making of any Eurodollar Advance that
such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent
such Lender's portion of the Advances to be made on such date, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount
available to the Administrative Agent on the date for the making of such
Advances and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,
make available to the Company a corresponding amount. If such portion is
not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and
the Administrative Agent shall have made such portion available to the
Company as aforesaid, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover
such portion on demand from such Lender, which demand shall be made in a
reasonably prompt manner. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify the Company and the Company shall repay such
corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Company, as the
case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day
from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the
Administrative Agent to the Company to the date such corresponding amount is
recovered by the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Company,
the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
fulfill its Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the
Company may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such
Lender hereunder.

(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by
it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such
Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of
any Borrowing.

SECTION 2.05. Interest.

(a) The Company shall pay interest on the Debit Balance (i) in
each Base Rate Advance Account at the Base Rate and (ii) in each Eurodollar

any Debit Balance in any Advance Account, with respect to any Lender, shall
also be payable on the Termination Date for such Lender and upon prepayment
of any Advance to the extent accrued on the amount so prepaid. Overdue
principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect
of each Advance and all other overdue amounts owing hereunder shall, except
in the case of a Eurodollar Advance, bear interest for each day such amount
is overdue at a rate per annum equal to 2% per annum in excess of the Base
Rate in effect from time to time and shall in the case of a Eurodollar
Advance bear interest for each day such amount is overdue at a rate per
annum equal to (A) during the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar
Advance, the greater of (x) 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect from
time to time and (y) 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be
paid on such amount immediately prior to the date on which such amount
became due and (B) after the expiration of such Interest Period, 2% per
annum above the Base Rate in effect from time to time. In no event shall
interest payable hereunder to any Lender exceed the maximum rate of interest
payable to such Lender under applicable law.

(b) For each Base Rate Advance or Eurodollar Advance the Company
shall select an interest period (each such period being an "Interest
Period") to be applicable to such Advance. The Interest Period for each
Base Rate Advance or Eurodollar Advance shall begin on the last day of the
immediately preceding Interest Period, if any. The duration of each
Interest Period shall be (i) in the case of a Base Rate Advance, 30 or 60
days (or such shorter period as shall extend to and end on the Termination
Date for any Lender) and (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Advance, one, two,
three or six months, in each case as the Company may select upon notice
received by the Administrative Agent (y) not later than 11:00 A.M. on the
first Business Day of such Interest Period, in the case of a Base Rate
Advance, or (z) at least three Business Days, in the case of a Eurodollar
Advance, prior to the first day of such Interest Period; provided, however,
that:

(i) if the Company fails to select the duration of any Interest
Period, on the day immediately following the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Advance the Company shall be deemed to
have requested a Base Rate Advance in the amount of such Advance with
an Interest Period of 30 days, and if (A) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.01 hereof (excluding those contained
in paragraphs (e) and (f) thereof) are true and accurate, (B) no event
has occurred or is continuing or would result from the Borrowing of
such Base Rate Advance which constitutes an Event of Default hereunder
or which would constitute such an Event of Default but for the
requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both and (C) no
Commitment Reallocation Event is to occur on the last day of the then
current Interest Period, the Advance Accounts of the Lenders for which
such Advance is outstanding shall be deemed to have been paid in the
amount of such Advance and the Base Rate Advance Accounts of such
Lenders shall be deemed debited in the amount of such Base Rate
Advance;

(ii) Interest Periods commencing on the same date for
Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing shall be of the same
duration;

(iii) the Company may not select any Interest Period in
respect of Advances which ends after the Termination Date then in
effect for any Lender; and

(iv) whenever the last day of any Interest Period would
otherwise occur on a day other than a Business Day, the last day of
such Interest Period shall be extended to occur on the next succeeding
Business Day; provided, in the case of any Interest Period for a
Eurodollar Advance, that if such extension would cause the last day of
such Interest Period to occur in the next following calendar month, the
last day of such Interest Period shall occur on the next preceding
Business Day.

The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise each Lender by telex or
telecopy facsimile of each Interest Period selected by the Company.

SECTION 2.06. Additional Interest on Eurodollar Advances. The
Company shall pay to each Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required
under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to
maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurodollar Advance of such Lender, from the date of
such Advance until maturity of such Advance, at an interest rate per annum
equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the
remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period
from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such LIBO Rate referred to in clause
(i) above by that percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Reserve
Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date on
which interest is payable on such Advance. Such additional interest shall
be determined by such Lender and notified to the Company through the
Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination.

(a) Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Administrative
Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each LIBO Rate.
Subject to the provisions of Section 2.04(b)(ii), if any one or more of the
Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the
Administrative Agent for determination of any such interest rate, the
Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of
timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the
Administrative Agent for purposes of this Agreement and, if requested by any
Lender, the applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for
determining the applicable interest rate.

(c) The Margin applicable to each interest rate shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent on the basis of timely information
furnished to it by the Company, Moody's or S&P with respect to the rating on
Long-term Debt or Commercial Paper; any change in the Margin shall be
effective on the earlier of the date on which such rating change is publicly
announced or on the date written confirmation of a change in the rating on
Long-term Debt or Commercial Paper is sent to the Company by either Moody's
or S&P. For purposes of determining the appropriate Level and Margin, if
the Company's rating satisfies the criteria in two Levels the applicable
Level shall be the one with the higher number and lower rating of the two.

SECTION 2.08. Repayment.

(a) Except as provided in Section 2.05(b)(i), the Company shall
repay the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made by each Lender on the
last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, and the Company shall
repay the unpaid principal amount of all Advances made by any Lender,
together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other amount
due hereunder to such Lender, on the Termination Date as in effect for such
Lender.

(b) On the later of each date when any reduction in the Lenders'
Commitment is made by the Company pursuant to Section 2.11(a) or the last
day of the current Interest Periods for the Advances to be repaid, the
Company shall repay the Advances in an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (x) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances outstanding on such
date over (y) the Total Commitments as reduced on such date pursuant to
Section 2.11(a).

(c) On the date when any Lender's Commitment is terminated
pursuant to Section 2.11, the Company shall repay the amount of all Advances
owing to such Lender.

SECTION 2.09. Increased Costs. If, due to (i) the
introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements referred to in Section 2.06) in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation, (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law) or (iii) the imposition,
modification or application of any capital adequacy or similar requirement
(A) against assets (funded or contingent) of, or credit or commitments to
extend credit extended by, any Lender or (B) otherwise applicable to the
obligations of any Lender under this Agreement, there shall be any increase
in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining Advances or Debit Balances (or, in the case of any capital
adequacy or similar requirement, having the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or increasing the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling the Lender, taking into consideration such Lender's policies
with respect to capital adequacy), which such Lender is not otherwise
compensated for by other provisions of this Agreement, then the Company
shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such
demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to indemnify such
Lender against such increased cost (or reduced rate of return or increased
amount of capital, to the extent such Lender reasonably determines such
reduction or increase to be allocable to the maintenance of the Agreement).
A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost (providing an
explanation thereof and the calculation thereof, all in reasonable detail,
and using reasonable averaging and attribution methods), submitted to the
Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by such Lender shall,
absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

SECTION 2.10. Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee on the
daily amount of such Lender's Commitment (determined without regard to the
amount of Advances outstanding thereunder and after giving effect to any
reduction thereof pursuant to Section 2.11) from the date hereof (in the
case of each Lender party hereto as of the Effective Date) or from the
effective date specified in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance (in the
case of any Lender becoming a Lender after the Effective Date), until the
Termination Date, as in effect for such Lender, payable in arrears on the
last day of each March, June, September and December during the term of such
Lender's Commitment, commencing June 30, 1993, and on any such Termination
Date, at the rate of: with respect to each day that (i) the Company's
rating on Long-term Debt is Level 1, .20% per annum, (ii) the Company's
rating on Long-term Debt is Level 2, .25% per annum, (iii) the Company's
rating on Long-term Debt is Level 3, .3125% per annum, (iv) the Company's
rating on Long-term Debt is Level 4 or the Company's rating on Commercial
Paper is Level 5, .375% per annum, or (v) the Company's rating on Long-term
Debt is Level 6, .4375% per annum. If any change in the rating by S&P or
Moody's shall result in a change in the Level, the change in the facility
fee shall be effective on the earlier of the date on which such rating
change is publicly announced or on the date written confirmation of such
ratings is sent to the Company by either Moody's or S&P. If the Company's
rating satisfies the criteria in two Levels, the applicable Level shall be
the one with the higher number and lower rating of the two Levels.

SECTION 2.11. Reduction of the Commitments.

(a) The Company may, upon at least five Business Days' notice to
the Administrative Agent, terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the
respective unused Commitments of the Lenders; provided that each partial
reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 or, if
greater, in an aggregate amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000.

(b) At any time, if no event has occurred and is continuing which
constitutes an Event of Default or which would constitute an Event of
Default but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both,
the Company may, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), terminate the Commitment of any one of
the Lenders (each an "Old Lender") upon at least five business days' notice
to the Administrative Agent and the Old Lender, and, effective upon the date
of termination of the entire Commitment of, and repayment of all amounts
hereunder owing to, the Old Lender, may replace that Lender with a New
Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.02; provided however, that,
as to outstanding Eurodollar Advances, a Commitment may be terminated only
at the end of an Interest Period such that the Commitment of an Old Lender
may be terminated in stages, a portion terminating as specified by the
Company in its notice and the remainder, equal to the outstanding Eurodollar
Advances, terminating at the end of the relevant Interest Period or Interest
Periods.

SECTION 2.12. Payments and Computations.

(a) The Company shall make each payment hereunder not later than
12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in United States dollars
to the Administrative Agent in same day funds at the Administrative Agent's
address provided for in Section 8.03. The Administrative Agent will
promptly thereafter make appropriate distribution of like funds to the
Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices.

(b) The Company hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder, to charge
from time to time against any or all of the Company's accounts with such
Lender any amount so due.

(c) All computations of interest in respect of Eurodollar
Advances and interest pursuant to Section 2.06 shall be made on the basis of
a year of 360 days, and all computations of facility fees and of interest in
respect of Base Rate Advances shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period
for which such interest or facility fees are payable. Each determination by
the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.06, by a Lender) of
an interest rate hereunder shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and
binding for all purposes.

(d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a
day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the
case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause a payment in
respect of Eurodollar Advances to be made in the next following calendar
month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Lenders hereunder that the Company will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in
full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.
If and to the extent the Company shall not have so made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed
to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, at the rate per annum equal to the rate customarily
used by member banks of the Federal Reserve System to settle net balances
due each other.

SECTION 2.13. Compensation.

The Company shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by
that Lender (which request shall be submitted to the Company (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) and shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of such amounts requested, which shall be based upon a method of
determination selected in good faith) for all losses, reasonable expenses
and liabilities (including, without limitation, any interest paid by that
Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar
Advances and any loss sustained by that Lender in connection with re-
employment of such funds), which that Lender may sustain: (i) if for any
reason (including without limitation the circumstances set forth in Section
2.04(c) but other than a default by that Lender) a borrowing of any
Eurodollar Rate Advance does not occur on a date specified therefor in a
Notice of Borrowing, (ii) if any repayment of any of its Eurodollar Advances
occurs on a date which is not the last day of any Interest Period, or (iii)
as a consequence of any other default by the Company to repay its Eurodollar
Advances when required by the terms of this Agreement; it being agreed and
understood that each Lender shall use its reasonable efforts to mitigate any
such loss or expense.

SECTION 2.14. Taxes.

(a) Any and all payments by the Company hereunder shall be made,
in accordance with Section 2.12, free and clear of and without deduction for
any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (1) in the
case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its net
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the
laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
is organized or any political subdivision thereof, (2) in the case of each
Lender, taxes imposed on its net income and franchise taxes imposed on it by
the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof and (3) in the case of each Lender and the
Administrative Agent, any taxes imposed by the United States by means of
withholding at the source if and to the extent that such taxes shall be in
effect and shall be applicable, on the date hereof, to payments to be made
to the Administrative Agent or such Lender's Applicable Lending Office (all
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities,
other than those excluded pursuant to the preceding clauses (1), (2) and
(3), being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Company shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 2.14) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may
be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and (iii)
the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) The Company will indemnify each Lender and the Administrative
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 2.14) paid by such Lender or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) or any liability (including penalties, interest
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
Each Lender agrees to provide reasonably prompt notice to the Administrative
Agent and the Company of any imposition of Taxes or Other Taxes against such
Lender; provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect such
Lender's right to indemnification hereunder. Each Lender agrees it will
promptly upon request by the Company furnish to the Company such evidence as
is reasonably available to such Lender as to the payment of the relevant
Taxes or Other Taxes, and that it will, if requested by the Company,
cooperate to the extent reasonable under the circumstances with the Company
in its efforts to obtain a refund or similar release in respect of such
payment.

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the
Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent upon request of any Lender
transmitted through the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in
Section 8.03, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof. If no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment
hereunder, the Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent upon request
of any Lender transmitted through the Administrative Agent, at such address,
a certificate from each appropriate taxing authority, or an opinion of
counsel acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in either case stating that
such payment is exempt from or not subject to Taxes.

(e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Company hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Company
contained in this Section 2.14 shall survive the payment in full of
principal and interest hereunder.

SECTION 2.15. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall
obtain any payment (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, through the exercise
of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Debit Balance in
any of its Advance Accounts (other than pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09,
2.11(b), 2.13 or 2.14) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account
of Debit Balances of the same type obtained by all the Lenders in the same
category, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from such other Lenders such
participations in such Debit Balances as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them,
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery,
but without interest. The Company agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully
as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of
such participation.

SECTION 2.16. Status of Prior Agreement. The Company, the
Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that the rights of each (if any)
under the Fourth Amendment and Restatement dated as of March 18, 1992 of the
Credit Agreement dated as of May 31, 1976, as amended by the First Amendment
dated as of October 5, 1992, shall (except, as to outstanding Advances,
commitment fees and interest accrued to the date of this Agreement, and
rights to indemnification and reimbursement of costs and expenses arising
prior to the date hereof which shall be governed by the provisions of such
Fourth Amendment and Restatement) cease and terminate as of the date of this
Agreement and the rights of each such party shall be governed by this
Agreement on and after such date.

SECTION 2.17. Extension of Commitments. At any time at not
more than twenty- seven (27) months nor less than ninety (90) days prior to
the Termination Date applicable to all or any Lenders, the Company may, at
its option, deliver to each Lender that has not theretofore rejected any
Extension Request delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17 a signed copy of
an Extension Request requesting an extension of such Termination Date to a
date one year after such Termination Date. Each Lender shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, to consent or not consent to any such
Extension Request and, if such Lender so consents, such Lender shall deliver
its consent to such Extension Request to the Company within forty-five (45)
days of the date of the Extension Request (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent). Any Lender that fails to consent to any Extension Request within
such forty-five-day period shall be deemed to have rejected such Extension
Request. If the Company shall not have received, within such forty-five-day
period, consents to such Extension Request from the Majority Lenders
(determined for purposes of this Section 2.17 by disregarding any Lender
which has theretofore rejected any Extension Request), the Company may elect
either (i) to withdraw the Extension Request by promptly notifying the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders originally receiving the Extension
Request by telephone, telex or telecopy facsimile of such withdrawal or (ii)
to proceed with such Extension Request by immediately notifying each Lender
which consented to the Extension Request and the Administrative Agent by
telephone, telex or telecopy facsimile, of the fact that the Majority
Lenders have not consented to the Extension Request and that the Company
nonetheless desires such extension, and any such Lender may, within five (5)
Business Days of its receipt of such notice from the Company, by telephone,
telex or telecopy facsimile notice to the Company and the Administrative
Agent, withdraw its consent to such Extension Request. If the Company
withdraws any Extension Request, such Extension Request shall thereafter be
disregarded for all purposes, including the determination of whether any
Lender has rejected an Extension Request. In the event any Lenders finally
consent to any Extension Request, the Termination Date to be extended
pursuant to such request shall be extended for one year but only as to such
consenting Lenders.

No Interest Period shall extend beyond any Termination Date,
regardless of any Lender's consent to any extension thereof. The
Commitment of any Lender rejecting an Extension Request with respect to a
Termination Date shall expire on such Termination Date, and the Company
shall pay all Advances of such Lender, and all other amounts due hereunder
to such Lender, in full on such Termination Date.

ARTICLE III
Representations and Warranties

SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company.
The Company represents and warrants as follows:

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and each
of the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. The
Company and each of the Subsidiaries have the corporate power,
authority and legal right to own and operate the assets and properties
and conduct the business now, and proposed to be, owned, operated and
conducted by it. All necessary consents, licenses, permits, approvals
or authorizations of, exemptions by, notices and reports to,
registrations, filings and declarations with, and any other act by or
in respect of, any Person requisite for such ownership, operation and
conduct have been obtained or performed except such of the foregoing
the failure to obtain or perform which would not, in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or
financial or other condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries are duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws
of each jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of property or
conduct of business requires such qualification and where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would, in the aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or
financial or other condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

(b) The Company has full corporate power, corporate authority and
legal right to execute and deliver this Agreement, to borrow hereunder
and to perform and observe the terms and provisions hereof.

(c) The execution and delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, require no governmental registrations or filings or approvals
and do not violate or contravene any law or any order of any court or
governmental agency or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to
which the Company is a party or by which it or any of its properties
may be bound.

(d) This Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency and reorganization laws and other similar laws governing the
enforcement of lessors' or creditors' rights and by the effects of
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

(e) There is no action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or
by or before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator now pending
or to the knowledge of the Company threatened against or affecting the
Company or the Subsidiaries or its or their properties which might
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the financial
condition or operations of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or purports to affect the legality,
validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the Company's ability
to repay any Advances hereunder.

(f) The consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as at December 31, 1991 and December 31,
1992, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and surplus
for the years then ended, certified by Deloitte & Touche, independent
public accountants, copies of which have been furnished to each Lender,
are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly set forth
the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as at such dates and the consolidated results
of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the
periods ended on such dates, all in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis, and since December 31, 1992, there has been no
material adverse change in such condition or operations which has not
been disclosed in writing to the Lenders prior to the date of this
Agreement.

(g) No proceeds of any Advance will be used to acquire any
security of a class which is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(h) The Company is not engaged principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulation U issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System), and no proceeds of any Advance will be used to purchase or
carry any margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any margin stock, or in any manner which might
cause such Advance or the application of such proceeds to violate (or
require any regulatory filing under) Regulation G, Regulation U or
Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
in each case as in effect on the date or dates of such Advance and such
use of proceeds.

(i) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates are in substantial
compliance with ERISA, none of the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any material funding deficiency within the
meaning of ERISA and none of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
has incurred any material liability to the PBGC in connection with any
employee benefit plan (or other class of benefit plan which the PBGC
has elected to insure) established or maintained by the Company or any
of its ERISA Affiliates. To the knowledge of the Company, after due
inquiry made at the time of the spin off referred to below, The Dial
Corp, an Arizona corporation ("Dial"), was at the time of its
distribution of 100% of the Capital Stock of the Company and the
Subsidiaries to the shareholders of Dial (the "spin off"), in
substantial compliance with ERISA, and the Company had no material
liability to the PBGC in connection with any employee benefit plan (or
other class of benefit plan which the PBGC has elected to insure)
established or maintained by Dial or any of its ERISA Affiliates at
such time.

(j) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an "investment
company" or a company controlled by an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(k) Except for limited recourse indebtedness and Secured
Indebtedness permitted hereunder, the obligations of the Company under
this Agreement to pay the principal of and interest on the Advances and
any and all other amounts due hereunder rank and will rank, as to
payment and security, at least pari passu with the highest ranking
indebtedness of the Company for borrowed money or under guarantees or
in respect of any indenture, contract, agreement or other instrument to
which the Company is a party or by which it is bound evidencing or
securing any obligation of the Company for borrowed money whether now
existing or incurred hereafter.

(l) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liabilities or
incurs any costs with respect to compliance with Environmental Laws
(including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures
required for clean-up or closure of properties presently or previously
owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or
maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by
law or as a condition to any license, permit or contract, any related
constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or
permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or
change in the nature of operations conducted thereat and any actual or
potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any
related costs and expenses) which will have, and the Company otherwise
believes that Environmental Laws are unlikely to have, a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

ARTICLE IV

opinion would materially impair the Company's ability to repay

shall include a statement to the effect of clause (i) above; provided,
however, that, if the Company is unable to make the representation and
warranty contained in subsection (e) of Section 3.01 on the date of an
Advance by reason of there being an action, suit or proceeding at law or in
equity pending or threatened against the Company or the Subsidiaries which
purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of this

misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Administrative Agent, Agents and Co-Agents: (i) may treat the Lender
making any Advance as the holder thereof until the Administrative Agent
receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such
Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, in accordance with Section
8.04; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the
Company), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it
and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall
not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with this Agreement; (iv) shall not
have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance
of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part
of the Company or to inspect the property (including the books and records)
of the Company, except as expressly set forth herein; (v) shall not be
responsible to any Lender for the due execution (other than its own due
execution), legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect of
this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other
instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, telex or telecopy
facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

SECTION 7.03. Citibank, BofA , Chemical, any Co-Agent and
Their Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment and the Advances made by
it, Citibank, BofA, Chemical or any Co-Agent, as the case may be, shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, an Agent
or a Co-Agent, as the case may be; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
unless otherwise expressly indicated, include each of Citibank, BofA,
Chemical and any Co-Agent in its individual capacity. Citibank, BofA,
Chemical and each Co-Agent and their respective affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and
generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries and any person or entity who may do business with or own
securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, all as if Citibank, BofA,
Chemical or such Co-Agent were not the Administrative Agent, an Agent or Co-
Agent, as the case may be, and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.

SECTION 7.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, any Agent, any Co-Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements referred to in Section 3.01 and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, any Agent, any Co-Agent or any other Lender and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify
the Administrative Agent, each Agent and each Co-Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the respective amounts of
the Advance Accounts then held by each of them (or if no Advances are at the
time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of their
Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such Agent or
such Co-Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent, such Agent or such Co-
Agent under this Agreement, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from
the Administrative Agent's, such Agent's or such Co-Agent's gross negligence
or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender
agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent and each Agent promptly upon
demand for its ratable share of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such agent
in connection with the preparation, execution, administration, or
enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities
under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Administrative Agent or such
Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company.

SECTION 7.06. Successor Agent. The Administrative Agent, any
Agent and any Co-Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Lenders and the Company and the Administrative Agent may be
removed at any time with or without cause by Majority Lenders. Upon any
such resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, Majority Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by Majority
Lenders, and if no successor Administrative Agent shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving
of notice of resignation or the removal of the retiring Administrative Agent
by Majority Lenders, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a
Lender or a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of
America or of any State thereof and having combined capital and surplus of
at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII
Miscellaneous

SECTION 8.01. No Waiver; Amendments. No failure or delay on
the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any power
or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right or power preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power hereunder. No
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor
consent to any departure by the Company therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and consented to by the
Majority Lenders (except that no such amendment, modification, waiver or
consent which would increase any Lender's Commitment, reduce, or postpone
any date fixed for any payment of, principal of, or interest on, the Debit
Balances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or change the
percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid Debit Balances
which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take action
hereunder (including, without limitation, any amendment to the definition of
"Majority Lenders" or this Section 8.01) or which would affect any provision
contained in Section 5.01, Section 5.02 (if and to the extent that the
Borrowing which is the subject of such amendment, waiver or consent would
involve an increase in the aggregate amount of Advances over the aggregate
amount of Advances outstanding immediately prior to such Borrowing), Section
5.03, this Section 8.01 or Section 8.05 shall be effective unless consented
to by all Lenders then having a Commitment) and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for
which given; provided, however, that the amount of any Lender's Commitment
may be raised by agreement in writing between the Company and such Lender,
with notice thereof to each other Lender then having a Commitment and to the
Administrative Agent. No amendment, modification or waiver of or consent
with respect to any provision contained in Article VII shall be effective
unless consented to by the Administrative Agent. No notice to or demand on
the Company in any case shall entitle the Company to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

SECTION 8.02. New Lenders. At any time when any Lender shall
have a Commitment, if no event has occurred and is continuing which
constitutes an Event of Default or which would constitute an Event of
Default but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both,
the Company may notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that it
desires to add one or more additional lenders to the Lenders hereunder;
provided, however, that no such new lender will have a Commitment larger
than the largest Commitment of a Lender. Such notice shall identify each
such lender, the amount of its proposed Commitment and the proposed
effective date of its inclusion hereunder (which shall be the last day of
all then current Interest Periods if there are Base Rate Advances or
Eurodollar Advances then outstanding from the Lenders). Upon such proposed
date, such lender shall become a Lender hereunder for all purposes and to
the same effect as if set forth on the signature pages hereof, subject to
its execution where indicated below and delivery to the Administrative Agent
of at least one counterpart of this Agreement (which shall be deemed to
include all amendments thereto) and the execution and delivery by the
Administrative Agent and the Company of each such counterpart.

SECTION 8.03. Notices, Etc. All communications and notices
provided for hereunder, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, shall
be in writing and, if to the Company, mailed or delivered to it, addressed
to it at Dial Tower, Phoenix, Arizona 85077, Attention of Treasurer's
Department, and if to any Lender, mailed or delivered to it, addressed to it
at its Domestic Lending Office as set forth on the signature pages hereof,
and, if to the Administrative Agent, mailed or delivered to it, addressed to
it c/o Citicorp USA, Inc., 725 South Figueroa Street, Los Angeles,
California 90017, Attention: Desmund Shirazi; or, as to each party, at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to
each other party.

SECTION 8.04 Assignments, Participations etc.

(a) Any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and
the Company, assign to any other current Lender, or, with notice to the
Administrative Agent and with the prior written consent of the Company,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, assign to any Eligible
Assignee (each an "Assignee") all or any part of the Advances or the
Commitments or any other rights or obligations of such Lender hereunder in a
minimum amount of $5,000,000; provided, however, that the amount of the
Advances and the Commitment of the assignor Lender being assigned may be in
an amount equal to such assignor Lender's entire Commitment and such
Lender's entire outstanding Advances provided, further, that the Company and
the Administrative Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with the interests so assigned to an Assignee until (i)
written notice of such assignment, together with payment instructions,
addresses and related information with respect to the Assignee, shall have
been given to the Company and the Administrative Agent by such Lender and
the Assignee and (ii) such Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered to
the Company and the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the
form of Exhibit C ("Assignment and Acceptance"); and (iii) the processing
fees of $2,500 shall have been paid to the Administrative Agent. Any
assignment hereunder shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage
of all rights and obligations of the assignor under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any of the preceding limitations on any Lender's ability to
assign any part of the Advances or the Commitments to any other Person, each
Lender may assign its rights (including, without limitation, rights to
payment) under this Agreement to any Federal Reserve Bank without notice to
or consent of, and without payment of any processing fee to, the Company or
the Administrative Agent. To facilitate any such pledge to a Federal
Reserve Bank, the Company will, upon its receipt of a written request from a
Lender stating that such Lender desires to pledge then outstanding Advances
to a Federal Reserve Bank, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory
note substantially in the form of Exhibit F to evidence such Advances.

(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assignor Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with any
of this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument
or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assignor Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of the Company or the performance or observance by the
Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such Assignee confirms that it has
received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial
statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any
Agent, any Co-Agent or such assignor Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement; (v) such Assignee confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (vi) such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative
Agent, the Agents and the Co-Agents to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent, the Agents and the Co-Agents by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and
(vii) such Assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their
terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

(c) From and after the date that the Administrative Agent
notifies the assignor Lender that it has received the Assignment and
Acceptance (which notice shall be promptly given by the Administrative
Agent), (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and (ii) the assignor Lender
shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its
rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining
portion of the assignor Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 8.03 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Company or any Lender at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
Immediately upon each assignee's making its payment under the Assignment and
Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but
only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and
the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The
Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the
assignor Lender pro tanto.

(e) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other
entities (a "Participant") participating interests in any Advances, the
Commitment of that Lender or any other interest of that Lender hereunder;
provided, however, that (i) the Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Lender shall remain solely responsible for
the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Company and the
Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the
Lender in connection with the Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, and (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating
interest under which the Participant shall have rights to approve any
amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to this Agreement except
to the extent such amendment, consent or waiver would: (A) extend the
Termination Date; or (B) reduce the interest rate or the amount of principal
or fees applicable to Advances or the Commitments in which such participant
is participating. In the case of any such participation, the Participant
shall not have any rights under this Agreement and all amounts payable by
the Company hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold
such participation, except that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement
are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and
payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall
be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating
interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the
amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender
under this Agreement.

(f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section 8.04, disclose to the Assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant, any information relating to the Company and any Subsidiary
furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Company; provided that,
prior to any such disclosure, the Assignee or Participant or proposed
assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any
confidential information relating to the Company or any Subsidiary received
by it from such Lender.

SECTION 8.05. Costs, Expenses and Taxes.

(a) The Company agrees to pay all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Administrative Agent and each Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and any amendment,
waiver or consent relating thereto (including the reasonable fees and out-
of-pocket expenses of O'Melveny & Myers and the allocated costs of internal
counsel) and out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent,
if any, including reasonable legal fees in connection with the
administration thereof and out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, if any, including reasonable legal
fees in connection with the enforcement thereof. In addition, the Company
shall pay any and all stamp and other taxes payable or determined to be
payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other documents to be delivered hereunder, and agrees to save the
Administrative Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all
liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or
omission to pay such taxes.

(b) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, the Company agrees to indemnify, pay and hold the
Administrative Agent, each Agent, each Lender, and the officers, directors,
employees and agents of the Administrative Agent, the Agents and the
Lenders, harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, costs and expenses (whether or not any of the foregoing Persons is
a party to any litigation), including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs and costs of investigation, with respect to any
acquisition or proposed acquisition or any other use or proposed use of
proceeds of the Advances (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"),
provided that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any such Persons. If any claim is made, or any action, suit or
proceeding is brought against any Person indemnified pursuant to this
Section 8.05(b), the indemnified Person shall notify the Company of such
claim or of the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding, and the
Company will assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding,
employing counsel selected by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified Person, and pay the fees and expenses of such counsel; provided,
however, that if counsel to the Administrative Agent or the Person seeking
indemnification hereunder shall reasonably determine that, due to conflicts
in the liabilities or defenses of the Company and the Administrative Agent,
the Agents and the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Agents or the
Lenders should retain their own counsel, the Administrative Agent, the
Agents and the Lenders shall have the right to retain their own counsel and
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of
the Company. The obligations of the Company under this Section 8.05(b)
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the discharge of the
Company's other obligations hereunder.

SECTION 8.06. Right of Set-off. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Company
(any such notice being expressly waived by the Company) and to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Company against any and all of the obligations of the Company
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify
the Company and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The
rights of each Lender under this Section 8.06 are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off)
which such Lender may have.

SECTION 8.07. Accounting Terms. All accounting terms not
specifically defined herein shall be construed in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis.

SECTION 8.08. Effectiveness of Action by, or Consent of,
Lenders. With respect to any provision of this Agreement under which action
may be taken or consent or approval given by holders of a specified
percentage of the Lenders, the action taken or consent or approval given by
such percentage shall be binding upon all of the Lenders to the same extent
and with the same effect as if each Lender had joined therein.

SECTION 8.09. Several Obligations. Subject to Section 8.10
hereof, the obligation of each Lender hereunder is several, and neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for the obligation
or Commitment of any other Lender hereunder, nor will the failure of any
Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder relieve the other Lenders
from the performance of their respective obligations hereunder. Nothing
contained in this Agreement and no action taken by the Lenders pursuant
hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders a partnership, association,
joint venture or other entity.

SECTION 8.10. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become
effective, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01,
when it shall have been executed by the Company and when the Administrative
Agent shall have been notified by each Lender that such Lender has executed
it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Company, the Administrative Agent hereunder and each of the Lenders and
their respective successors and assigns, except that the Company shall not
have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without
the prior written consent of each of the Lenders.

SECTION 8.11 Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this
Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as
to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other
jurisdiction.

SECTION 8.12 Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of
the several sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction
of any provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.13. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York
without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.

SECTION 8.14. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts and by the several parties hereto
on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be an
original, but all such separate counterparts shall together constitute but
one and the same instrument.

SECTION 8.15. Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE COMPANY, THE
LENDERS, THE CO-AGENTS, THE AGENTS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH HEREBY
AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE
OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. The scope of this
waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may
be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this
transaction, including without limitation contract claims, tort claims,
breach of duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. The
Company, the Lenders, the Co-Agents, the Agents and the Administrative Agent
each (i) acknowledges that this waiver is a material inducement for the
Company, the Lenders, the Co-Agents, the Agents and the Administrative Agent
to enter into a business relationship, that the Company, the Lenders, the
Co-Agents, the Agents and the Administrative Agent have already relied on
this waiver in entering into this Agreement or accepting the benefits
thereof, as the case may be, and that each will continue to rely on this
waiver in their related future dealings and (ii) further warrants and
represents that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel, and that
it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following
consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER MAY NOT BE MODIFIED ORALLY AND
MAY ONLY BE MODIFIED IN WRITING EXPRESSLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 8.15,
AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH
AMENDMENT, RENEWAL, SUPPLEMENT OR MODIFICATION EXPRESSLY PROVIDES OTHERWISE.
In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent
to a trial by the court.

[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement
to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of

Re: Greyhound Financial Corporation Fifth Amendment and
Restatement dated as of May 18, 1993 of Credit Agreement
dated as of May 31, 1976

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

As Vice President and counsel to Greyhound Financial Corporation,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), I am familiar with the Fifth
Amendment and Restatement dated as of May 18, 1993 of Credit Agreement dated
May 31, 1976, among the Company, the Lenders named therein, the Co-Agents
named therein, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association,
Chemical Bank and Citibank, N.A., as Agents, and Citibank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent (the "Credit Agreement"). All terms used herein that
are defined in the Credit Agreement have the respective meanings specified
in the Credit Agreement. This letter is being delivered to you in
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 5.01(b) of the Credit
Agreement and with the understanding that you are entering into the Credit
Agreement in reliance on the opinions expressed herein.

In this connection, I have examined such certificates of public
officials, certificates of officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries and
copies certified to my satisfaction of corporate documents and records of
the Company and the Subsidiaries and of other papers, and have made such
other investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for
my opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied upon such certificates of
public officials and of officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries with
respect to the accuracy of material factual matters contained therein which
were not independently established.

Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications, limitations
and assumptions contained herein, it is my opinion that:

1. The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
under the laws of the State of Arizona. The Company has all requisite
corporate power and corporate authority to own and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted and to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Agreement.

2. The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement
have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of
the Company. The Credit Agreement has be duly executed and delivered by
authorized officers of the Company and constitutes the legally valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (a)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

3. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

4. The extension, arranging and obtaining of the credit
represented by the Credit Agreement do not result in any violation of
Regulation G, T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

5. None of the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement, the
making of any Advances thereunder or compliance with the provisions thereof
(A) conflicts with, or results in a breach or violation of the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (B) results in a material breach
or violation of, or constitutes a material default under, the terms,
conditions or provisions of (i) any material loan agreement or other
contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party, (ii) any order,
writ judgment or decree that the Company or any Subsidiary is a party to or
by which any of the Company's or any Subsidiary's assets or properties are
bound and which is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (iii) any present United States federal, Delaware corporate or
Arizona statute, rule or regulation, known to me to be applicable to or
binding on the Company and of a type commonly applicable to transactions of
the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement or (C) results in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the assets or properties of the Company or any
Subsidiary under any agreement or contract referred to in clause (B)(i)
above.

6. No governmental consents, approvals, registrations,
declarations or filings are required to be obtained or made by the Company
in connection with the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

7. To the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits or
proceedings (administrative, judicial or otherwise) pending or threatened
against the Company or any Subsidiary which have a significant likelihood of
materially and adversely affecting (a) the business, operations, prospects
or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (b) the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations under the Credit Agreement, except as disclosed on Schedule II
hereto.

I am admitted to the bar in the State of Arizona, and I express no
opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction except the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United
States of America. While the Credit Agreement is stated to be governed by
the laws of the State of New York, I have, with your permission, expressed
the opinions herein as if the Credit Agreement were governed by the laws of
the State of Arizona. With respect to such laws, my opinions are what the
law is at the date hereof, and I assume no obligation to supplement this
opinion due to any change in the law, legislative action, judicial decision
or otherwise.

To the extent that the obligations of the Company may be dependent
upon such matters, I have assumed for the purposes of this opinion that each
Person who is a party to the Credit Agreement (other than the Company) is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation; that the Credit Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each such Person (other than the
Company) and constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of each
such Person (other than the Company), enforceable in accordance with its
terms; the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of each
natural person executing the Credit Agreement (other than any such person
executing the Credit Agreement on behalf of the Company); the authenticity
and completeness of documents submitted as originals, and the conformity of
documents submitted as copies; that the Credit Agreement accurately
describes and contains the agreement and mutual understandings of the
parties, and that there are no verbal or written statements or agreements
that modify, amend or vary, or purport to modify, amend or vary, any of the
terms of the Credit Agreement; that you will receive no interest, charges,
fees or other benefits or compensation in the nature of interest in
connection with the Credit Agreement or its related transactions other than
those that the Company has agreed in writing to pay; that all parties to the
Credit Agreement will enforce their respective rights thereunder in
circumstances and in a manner which are commercially reasonable and in
accordance with applicable law; and that each Person who is a party to the
Credit Agreement (other than the Company) has the requisite corporate or
other organizational power and authority to perform is obligations under the
Credit Agreement.

This opinion is being delivered upon the express instructions of
the Company to Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., Bank
of America National Trust and Savings Association, and Chemical Bank, as
Agents, the Co-Agents and the Lenders under the Credit Agreement and is
solely for their benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated
thereby. This opinion may not be relied upon by, filed with, disclosed to,
quoted in any manner to, referenced in any written report, financial
statement or other document to, or delivered to any other person, firm or
corporation for any purpose, without my prior written consent, except that
the Administrative Agent, each Agents, each Co-Agent and each Lender may use
this opinion (i) in connection with a review of the Credit agreement and
transactions related thereto by a regulatory agency having supervisory
authority over any such Person for the purpose of confirming the existence
of this opinion, (ii) in connection with the assertion of a defense as to
which this opinion is relevant and necessary, (iii) in response to a court
order or (iv) in connection with any assignment of any Advances or
Commitment to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of the
Credit Agreement, and any such Eligible Assignee may rely on this opinion as
if it were addressed and had been delivered to such Eligible Assignee on the
date hereof.

Very truly yours,
