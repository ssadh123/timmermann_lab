THE ADELPHIA GROUP TO INCREASE INVESTMENT IN 
TELE-MEDIA PROPERTIES

Coudersport, PA - May 27, 1994

Adelphia Communications Corporation (NASDAQ-NMS:ADLAC) and the
affiliated companies it manages (the "Adelphia Group") today
announced the signing of a letter of intent providing for an
increase in the Adelphia Group's overall investment in cable
systems held by Tele-Media Investment Partnership, L.P. ("TMIP"). 
The new investment will result in the Adelphia Group having a
significant equity interest in TMIP. Adelphia and TMIP will hold
interests in or provide management services to cable systems
serving approximately 330,000 subscribers. Adelphia's
consolidated leverage is not expected to increase as a result of
this transaction.

The Adelphia Group by itself and through its investment in Tele-
Media will manage approximately 1,645,000 subscribers. Both
Adelphia and Tele-Media, pioneers in cable since the 1950's and
headquartered in Pennsylvania, share a great history in
communications and a vision and enthusiasm for the future of the
telecommunications industry. The combination of the companies
will provide significant synergies derived from operating and
purchasing capability, access to capital markets and effective
clustering of cable systems, including an increase of Adelphia's
Southeast Florida cluster to 400,000 subscribers and a
strengthened presence in the eastern third of the United States.

John Rigas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Adelphia,
said, "I have known Bob Tudek and Everett Mundy since the early
days of the cable industry and look forward to sharing our
management talents to continue to strengthen both companies to
meet the challenges of building broadband networks, servicing
customers and realizing new revenue streams." Bob Tudek,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tele-Media, said, "My
partner, Everett Mundy, and I and the entire Tele-Media
management team believe that this 
investment by Adelphia will provide Tele-Media with the means to
viably participate in the building of the nation's future
telecommunication network." 

The letter of intent is subject to mutually acceptable
documentation, financing, approval by Adelphia's Board of
Directors and other conditions.

Adelphia currently owns or manages cable television systems serving
approximately 1,315,000 subscribers in 11 states.
