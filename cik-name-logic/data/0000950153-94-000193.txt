ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

Pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 33-60982) (the
"Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and
declared effective by the Commission on July 26, 1993, the Registrant has
registered its senior, senior subordinated and subordinated debt securities (the
"Debt Securities"), and certain other securities of the Registrant, for delayed
or continuous offering to the public pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act for a
maximum aggregate initial offering price of $3 billion (or the equivalent
thereof denominated in one or more foreign currencies, foreign currency units or
composite currencies). Reference is made to the Registration Statement for
further information concerning the terms of the Debt Securities registered
pursuant to the Registration Statement and the offering thereof.

An Indenture (the "Indenture"), substantially in the form of Exhibit 4.2 to
the Registration Statement was executed as of August 4, 1993, between the
Registrant and The Bank of New York, as Trustee, relating to senior debt
securities of the Registrant, including a series of senior Debt Securities
consisting of up to $750 million principal amount of the Registrant's
Medium-Term Notes, Series B Due Nine Months or More from Date of Issue. An
amendment to the Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") was executed as of
September 13, 1994 between the Registrant and The Bank of New York. The
description of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Supplemental
Indenture are incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled
"Description of Debt Securities -- Senior Debt Securities" of the Prospectus,
dated September 14, 1994, which has been filed with the Commission pursuant to
Rule 424(b) under the Act.

The Registrant is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K in order to cause
the Supplemental Indenture to be incorporated into the Registration Statement by
reference. By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K, however, the Registrant
does not believe that the Supplemental Indenture or the information set forth
herein represent, either individually or in the aggregate, a "fundamental
change" (as such term is used in Item 512(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K) in the
information set forth in the Registration Statement.
