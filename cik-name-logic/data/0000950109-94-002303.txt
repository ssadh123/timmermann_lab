TELECABLE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 1994
(UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1--BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

The accompanying unaudited financial statements of TeleCable Corporation
and subsidiaries ("TeleCable") have been prepared using accounting
principles consistent with those disclosed in the December 31, 1993
financial statements. Due to the interim nature of the financial
statements, they do not include all of the disclosures and notes required
by generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of
operations for the nine month periods ended September 30, 1994 and 1993
are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the
entire year or any interim period. These financial statements should be
read in connection with TeleCable's December 31, 1993 financial
statements.

On January 1, 1994, TeleCable adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115 ("FAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities". One of the provisions of FAS 115 requires that
equity securities be classified as available for sale, or trading.
Available for sale securities are carried at their fair values with the
amount of unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity. TeleCable does not have any
securities classified as trading. Accordingly, TeleCable classified equity
securities with a fair value of $9.2 million at September 30, 1994 as
available for sale. Stockholders' deficit at September 30, 1994 includes
$4.2 million relating to unrealized gains on securities available for
sale, net of income taxes.

NOTE 2--DEBT:

In March 1994, TeleCable repaid $30 million of expiring term debt with
proceeds from a new unsecured $40 million note that is due 2004. Interest
is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.52%.

NOTE 3--PROPOSED MERGER TRANSACTION:

On August 8, 1994, TeleCable, Tele-Communications, Inc. ("TCI"), and TCI
Communications, Inc. ("TCIC") entered into a definitive merger agreement,
whereby TeleCable will be merged into TCIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
TCI. The aggregate $1.6 billion purchase price will be satisfied by TCIC's
assumption of approximately $300 million of TeleCable's net liabilities
and the issuance to TeleCable's shareholders of shares of TCI Class A
Common Stock (currently estimated to be approximately 42 million shares)
and 1 million shares of TCI Series D Preferred Stock with an aggregate
initial liquidation value of $300 million. The TCI Series D Preferred
Stock, which will accrue dividends at a rate of 5.5% per annum, will be
convertible into 10 million shares of TCI Class A Common Stock. The TCI
Series D Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the option of TCI after
five years and at the option of either TCI or the holder after ten years.
Although the amount of net liabilities to be assumed by TCIC and the
number of shares of TCI Class A Common Stock to be issued to TeleCable's
shareholders are subject to closing adjustments, TeleCable does not
believe that any such adjustments will be material. The merger agreement
requires the approval of TeleCable's shareholders and various franchise
and government authorities.

TCI COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(formerly Tele-Communications, Inc.)

Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements

September 30, 1994
(unaudited)

The following unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet of TCIC,
dated as of September 30, 1994, assumes that (i) the proposed TeleCable merger
(the "Merger") (ii) the combination of TCIC and Liberty Media Corporation
("Liberty"), whereby TCIC and Liberty each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
TCI (the "TCI/Liberty Combination") and (iii) the transfer of United Artists
International, Inc. from TCIC to TCI International Holdings, Inc. (the
"International Transfer") had occurred as of such date. See notes (1), (2) and
(3).

In addition, the following unaudited condensed pro forma combined
statements of operations of TCIC for the nine months ended September 30, 1994
and the year ended December 31, 1993 assume that the proposed Merger, the
TCI/Liberty Combination and the International Transfer had occurred as of
January 1, 1993.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the proposed Merger, the
TCI/Liberty Combination and the International Transfer had occurred as of
January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma combined financial statements of
TCIC should be read in conjunction with the condensed pro forma financial
statements and the related notes thereto of TCI included elsewhere herein and
the respective historical financial statements and the related notes thereto of
TCIC and TCI.

Notes to Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements

September 30, 1994
(unaudited)

(1) As of August 8, 1994, TCI, TCIC and TeleCable entered into a definitive
merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") whereby TeleCable will be merged
into TCIC. The aggregate $1.6 billion purchase price will be satisfied by
TCIC's assumption of approximately $300 million of TeleCable's net
liabilities and the issuance to TeleCable's shareholders of shares of TCI
Class A common stock (currently estimated to be approximately 41.7 million
shares) and 1 million shares of Series D Preferred Stock with an aggregate
initial liquidation value of $300 million. The Series D Preferred Stock,
which will accrue dividends at a rate of 5.5% per annum, will be
convertible into 10 million shares of TCI Class A common stock. The Series
D Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the option of TCI after five years
and at the option of either TCI or the holder after ten years. Although
the amount of net liabilities to be assumed by TCIC and the number of
shares of TCI Class A common stock to be issued to TeleCable's shareholders
are subject to closing adjustments, management does not believe that any
such adjustments will be material. The merger agreement requires the
approval of TeleCable's shareholders and various franchise and other
governmental authorities. 

(2) Subsequent to September 30, 1994, TCI was reorganized based upon four lines
of business: Domestic Cable and Communications; Programming; International
Cable and Programming; and Technology/Venture Capital. In connection with
this reorganization, on November 18, 1994, TCIC transferred its ownership
of United Artists International, Inc. to TCI International Holdings, Inc.
in exchange for 79,903 shares of a newly created class of TCI preferred
stock, Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, Series E (the "Series E
Preferred Stock"). Such transaction has been reflected at historical cost.
Series E Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 5.0% per annum
and is convertible into TCI Class A common stock at the initial conversion
rate of 1,000 shares of TCI Class A common stock for one share of the
Series E Preferred Stock.

(3) The TCI/Liberty Combination, which were consummated on August 4, 1994, were
structured as a tax free exchange whereby the common stock of TCIC and
Liberty and the preferred stock of Liberty were exchanged for like shares
of TCI. The merger agreement provided that each share of TCIC's and
Liberty's common stock (including shares held by TCIC's or Liberty's
subsidiaries) would be converted into one share and 0.975 of a share,
respectively, of the corresponding class of TCI's common stock. Shares of
Liberty Class E Preferred Stock were converted into shares of a preferred
stock of TCI having designations, preferences, rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions substantially identical to the shares of
preferred stock being converted. Shares of the remaining Liberty preferred
stock held by subsidiaries of TCIC were converted into shares of a class of
TCI preferred stock having an equivalent fair value to that which was given
up. The TCI/Liberty Combination has been accounted for as a purchase of 
Liberty by TCI utilizing Liberty's historical predecessor cost.

million. The number of shares of TCI Class A common stock to be issued,
which will be calculated using a per share value of $24, is dependent upon
the amount of net liabilities of TeleCable that is assumed by TCIC at
closing and certain other factors. See note (1) above. 

(8) Represents the elimination of the historical equity of the International
Transfer and the issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock to TCIC recorded
at historical cost.

amount is calculated utilizing 517,168,689 weighted average shares of TCI
at September 30, 1994 (such amount representing TCI's weighted average
shares, as disclosed in its historical financial statements), adjusted for
the effect of shares issued in the TCI/Liberty Combination as if such
