Item 5. Other Events

A lawsuit concerning the proposed expansion of a
transmission line was filed on April 28, 1994 against The
Narragansett Electric Company (Narragansett), its parent, New
England Electric System (NEES), and an affiliate, New England
Power Service Company, in the Superior Court of Rhode Island. 
The plaintiffs are residents of property which borders existing
Narragansett transmission lines in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. 
Narragansett has a proposal before the Rhode Island Energy
Facilities Siting Board (EFSB) to upgrade one of the lines and
relocate the lines on the existing right of way. The plaintiffs
allege that fear of health risks from exposure to high voltage
power lines has devalued their property and ask for unspecified
damages. The plaintiffs have also asked for an injunction to
halt the proposed changes to the transmission lines and an order
to remove the existing power lines. The EFSB is currently
conducting hearings on Narragansett's proposal to upgrade and
relocate the transmission lines.
