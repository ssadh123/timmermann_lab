Item 5. Other Events.

On January 11, 1994 South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), a
wholly owned subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (the Company), has reached a
settlement with Westinghouse Electric Corporation resolving a dispute
involving steam generators provided by Westinghouse to SCE&G's V. C. Summer
Nuclear Station (see Note 4C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
inlcuded in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 30, 1993).

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. SCE&G had filed an action in
May 1990 against Westinghouse in the U. S. District Court for South Carolina
seeking compensation for damages to the Summer Station.

In commenting on the settlement, Bruce Kenyon, SCE&G's president and
chief operating officer, said: "We are pleased to have this nearly four-year
dispute resolved. The settlement is in the best interest of all parties and
avoids what would have been a costly and uncertain trial. In addition, our
electric customers will benefit as costs for Summer Station operations will be
reduced."

SCE&G operates the 885-MW electric generating facility and had previously
announced that it plans to replace the plant's three steam generators in the
fourth quarter of 1994, during a scheduled refueling.
