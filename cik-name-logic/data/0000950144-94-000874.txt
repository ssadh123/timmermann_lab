BANCFIRST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. The preceding consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of BANCFIRST Corporation (formerly ALAFIRST Bancshares, Inc.), and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, BANKFIRST, a federal savings bank,
(collectively "the Bank").

2. The preceding consolidated financial statements at December 31, 1993
and for the three month periods ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 have
been prepared in accordance with instructions pursuant to Form 10-Q
Quarterly Report. The consolidated financial statements are unaudited
but, in the opinion of Management, reflect all accruals and
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Bank's financial
position and results of its operations and its cash flows at the dates
and for the periods indicated. All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature. The results of operations for the three months
ended December 31, 1993 are not necessarily indicative of results to
be expected for the entire fiscal year of 1994.

3. Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares
plus equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of shares
issuable under stock options is immaterial.

4. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS") Number 114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan and SFAS Number 115,
Accounting for Certain Investment in Debt and Equity Securities were
issued in May, 1993. SFAS Number 114 addresses the accounting by
creditors for impairment of certain loans and applies to all loans
that are restructured in a troubled debt restructuring. It requires
that impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected
cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. This
Statement applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1994. The Bank has not yet decided if it will elect
early adoption of this Statement, and Management cannot estimate the
effects of adoption on the financial statements. SFAS Number 115
addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all
investments in debt securities. Those investments are to be classified
in three categories with each having a specified accounting method as
to carrying value and recognition of unrealized gains and losses.
This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1993. The Bank has adopted this Statement for fiscal year
beginning October 1, 1993. As a result of this adoption, certain
investment securities and mortgage-backed securities classified as
available for sale are carried at market value, and $693,000 of
unrealized appreciation, net of related income tax effect, on
securities available for sale is shown as a component of stockholders'
equity at December 31, 1993. Prior to this adoption, at September 30,
1993, certain investment securities and mortgage-backed securities
classified as held for sale were stated at the lower of cost or
market.

5. On January 28, 1994, the Bank and Union Planters Corporation ("UPC"),
Memphis, Tennessee, announced the signing of a definitive agreement
for UPC to acquire the Bank with an exchange of 1.078 shares of UPC
common stock for each share of BANCFIRST common stock. The transaction
is subject to regulatory approval and the approval of BANCFIRST's
shareholders.
