FORD & VW MOVE TO DISSOLVE AUTOLATINA 

DEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 1 -- Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen AG have 

agreed on a gradual separation process leading toward dissolution of their 

Autolatina joint venture in Brazil and Argentina within a year.

"We believe that Ford will be better able to compete effectively in these

two markets by operating on its own," affirmed W. Wayne Booker, executive vice

president, Ford's International Automotive Operations. "Brazil and Argentina 

will continue to be important markets for Ford."

Autolatina was founded in 1987, when difficult market and economic 

conditions made such cooperation a good strategy for both companies, Booker 

said. "Conditions are significantly different now in both countries, " he 

said. "The separation will help Ford use the strength of its worldwide 

organization to pursue new opportunities for dealers, suppliers, employees, 

and especially Ford customers."

Booker also announced key personnel appointments for Ford in Brazil and 

Argentina once the separation process is complete. 

Gurminder S. Bedi, 47, will be president and CEO of Ford Argentina and 

Brazil Operations. He presently is director superintendent of Autolatina.

Ivan Fonseca e Silva, 44, will be president, Ford Brazil. He, is 

presently vice president - Business, Labor Relations, Human Resources and 

Legal Affairs at Autolatina. 

Jorge Mostany 47, will be president, Ford Argentina. He is presently 

president of Autolatina, Argentina.
