ITEM 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company's management has prepared and is responsible for
the presentation, integrity and objectivity of the financial
statements and related information included in this report. The
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis and, in some cases, include estimates that are based upon
management's judgment and the best available information, giving
due consideration to materiality. Financial information
contained elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
financial statements.

The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls
which it believes is adequate to provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded, transactions are executed in
accordance with management authorization and the financial
records are reliable for preparing the financial statements. The
system of internal accounting controls is supported by written
policies and procedures, by a staff of internal auditors and by
the selection and training of qualified personnel. The internal
audit staff conducts comprehensive audits of the Company's system
of internal accounting controls. Management strives to maintain
an adequate system of internal controls, recognizing that the
cost of such a system should not exceed the benefits derived. In
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
independent public accountants (Arthur Andersen & Co.), obtained
a sufficient understanding of the Company's internal controls to
plan their audit and determine the nature, timing and extent of
other tests to be performed. No material internal control
weaknesses have been reported to management, nor is management
aware of any such weaknesses.

The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee comprised
entirely of outside directors, meets periodically with
management, the internal auditor and Arthur Andersen & Co. to
discuss financial reporting matters, internal control and
auditing. To ensure their independence, both the internal
auditor and Arthur Andersen & Co. have full and free access to
the Audit Committee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of
IES Utilities Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of
capitalization of IES Utilities Inc. (an Iowa corporation) as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of income,
retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements
referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of IES Utilities Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, effective
January 1, 1993, IES Utilities Inc. changed its method of
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) GENERAL:

IES Utilities Inc. (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IES
Industries Inc. (Industries) and is subject to regulation by the Iowa 
Utilities Board (IUB) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

On June 4, 1993, Industries announced that its wholly-owned utility
subsidiaries, Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (IE) and Iowa Southern
Utilities Company (IS), filed applications for regulatory authority to merge.
The merger became effective December 31, 1993, following receipt of all
necessary Boards of Directors, shareholder and regulatory approvals.

IE is the surviving corporation and has been renamed IES Utilities Inc.
The separate existence of IS has ceased. The Company serves a total of 
325,000 electric and 170,000 natural gas retail customers as well as 32 resale 
customers in more than 550 Iowa communities.

The merger was accounted for under a method of accounting similar to
pooling of interests, which combined the ownership interests of IE and IS. 
The assets and liabilities of IE and IS were combined at their recorded 
amounts as of the merger date.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
(a) Regulatory Assets -

The Company is subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation" (SFAS 71). The regulatory assets represent probable future 
revenue associated with certain incurred costs as these costs are recovered 
through the ratemaking process. At December 31, 1993, regulatory assets 
were comprised of the following items, and were reflected in the Balance 
Sheets as follows:

Regulatory Assets
(in millions)

Deferred income taxes (Note 2(b)) $ 88.6
Energy efficiency programs 18.5
Employee pension and benefit costs (Note 8) 14.1
Environmental liabilities (Note 12(f)) 12.9
National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Note 12(h)) 12.5
FERC Order No. 636 transition costs (Note 12(i)) 5.0
Cancelled plant costs 3.3
Regulatory study costs 1.5
156.4
Less current amounts 6.4
$150.0

Refer to the individual footnotes referenced above for a discussion of 
the specific items reflected in regulatory assets. The amounts reflected 
for energy efficiency programs are a result of an IUB mandate whereby 2% of 
electric and 1.5% of gas gross retail operating revenues are to be expended 
annually for energy efficiency programs. Under this mandate, the Company will 
make its initial filing for recovery of the costs in 1994.

(b) Income Taxes -

The Company follows the liability method of accounting for deferred 
income taxes, which requires the establishment of deferred tax liabilities and 
assets, as appropriate, for all temporary differences between the tax basis 
of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the financial 
statements. Deferred taxes are recorded using currently enacted tax rates.

Except as noted below, income tax expense includes provisions for 
deferred taxes to reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between 
the time when certain costs are recorded in the accounts and when they are 
deducted for tax return purposes. As temporary differences reverse, the 
related accumulated deferred income taxes are reversed to income. Investment 
tax credits have been deferred and are subsequently credited to income over 
the average lives of the related property.

Consistent with ratemaking practices, deferred tax expense is not 
recorded for certain temporary differences (primarily related to utility 
property, plant and equipment). Accordingly, the Company has recorded 
deferred tax liabilities and regulatory assets, as discussed in Note 2(a).

(c) Temporary Cash Investments -

Temporary cash investments are stated at cost which approximates market
value and are considered cash equivalents for the Statements of Cash Flows.
These investments consist of short-term liquid investments which have 
maturities of less than 90 days from the date of acquisition and at 
December 31, 1993, include $15 million invested with affiliated companies.

(d) Depreciation of Utility Property, Plant and Equipment -

The average rates of depreciation for electric and gas properties,
including the Company's nuclear generating station, the Duane Arnold Energy
Center (DAEC), which is being depreciated over a 36 year life using a 
remaining life method, were as follows:

1993 1992 1991
Electric 3.5% 3.5% 3.5%
Gas 3.5% 3.0% 3.0%

Based on the most recent site specific study, completed in 1992, the
Company's 70% share of the estimated cost to decommission the DAEC and return
the underlying property to its original state approximated $223 million 
in 1992 dollars. The study is based on the prompt removal and dismantling
decommissioning alternative and is assumed to begin at the end of the DAEC's
operating license in 2014. The level of annual recovery through rates of
decommissioning costs is $5.5 million, which is deposited in external trust
funds, and is based on a remaining life recovery method. The annual recovery
level is reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted in each rate case.
Decommissioning costs, at the level collected through rates, are included in 
"Depreciation and amortization" expense in the Statements of Income. 
In addition to the $28.1 million invested in the external trust funds 
as indicated in the Balance Sheets, the Company has an internal 
decommissioning reserve of $21.7 million recorded as accumulated depreciation. 
Earnings on the external funds are recognized as income and a corresponding 
amount of interest expense is recorded for the reinvestment of the earnings.

(e) Allowance for Funds Used During Construction -

The allowance for funds used during construction (AFC), which represents
the cost during the construction period of funds used for construction 
purposes, is capitalized as a component of the cost of utility plant. 
The amount of AFC applicable to debt funds and to other (equity) funds, 
a non-cash item, is computed in accordance with the prescribed FERC formula. 
The aggregate gross rates used for 1993-1991 were 5.7%, 9.2% and 8.5%, 
respectively.

(f) Operating Revenues -

The Company accrues revenues for services rendered but unbilled at
month-end in order to more properly match revenues with expenses.

(g) Adjustment Clauses -

The Company's tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its electric
and natural gas rates for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy and
in the cost of natural gas purchased for resale. Changes in the under/over
collection of these costs are reflected in "Fuel for production" and "Gas
purchased for resale" in the Statements of Income. The cumulative effects 
are reflected in the Balance Sheets as a current asset or current 
liability, pending automatic reflection in future billings to customers.

(h) Accumulated Refueling Outage Provision -

The IUB allows the Company to collect, as part of its base revenues, 
funds to offset other operating and maintenance expenditures incurred 
during refueling outages at the DAEC. As these revenues are collected, an 
equivalent amount is charged to other operating and maintenance expenses 
with a corresponding credit to a reserve. During a refueling outage, the 
reserve is reversed to offset the refueling outage expenditures.

(i) Reclassifications -

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified on a basis consistent
with the 1993 presentation.

(3) ACQUISITION OF IOWA SERVICE TERRITORY OF UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY:

Effective December 31, 1992, the Company acquired the Iowa distribution
system and a portion of the Iowa transmission facilities of Union Electric
Company (UE) for $65.0 million in cash. The acquisition was accounted for as 
a purchase. The net book value of the acquired assets was approximately 
$34.4 million and the amount of the purchase price in excess of the 
book value ($30.6 million) has been recorded as an acquisition adjustment. 
The acquisition adjustment is being amortized over the life of the property 
and is included in "Other income and deductions - Miscellaneous, net" in the 
Statements of Income. Recovery of the acquisition adjustment through rates 
will be addressed in future rate proceedings. See Note 12(b) for a 
discussion of the purchase power contracts with UE associated with this 
acquisition.

(4) RATE MATTERS:
(a) Gas Rate Cases -
Former IE Service Territory

In July 1992, IE applied to the IUB for an increase in gas rates of
$6.3 million annually, or 5.9%. Effective September 30, 1992, the 
IUB authorized an interim increase of $5.4 million, subject to refund. On 
April 30, 1993, the IUB issued its "Final Decision and Order," which 
approved stipulations between IE and certain intervenors providing for an 
annual increase in revenues of $5.5 million. IE did not have any refund 
liability as a result of the Order.

Former IS Service Territory

In July 1992, IS applied to the IUB for an increase in gas rates of 
$2.3 million annually, or 6.2%. Effective September 30, 1992, the IUB
authorized an interim increase of $1.9 million, subject to refund. In 
February 1993, the IUB approved stipulations between IS and certain 
intervenors in the proceeding that provided for an annual increase in revenues 
of $1.6 million. As a result of the Order, IS refunded approximately 
$0.2 million, including interest, in the second quarter of 1993.

(b) 1991 Electric Rate Case -

In October 1991, IE applied to the IUB for an increase in interim and 
final retail electric rates of $18.9 million annually, or 6.0%. The IUB 
approved an interim rate increase of $15.6 million, annually, which became 
effective in December 1991, subject to refund.

In July 1992, the IUB issued its "Final Decision and Order" approving an
annual electric rate increase of $7.9 million. The application of double
leverage ratemaking theory to IE's capital structure accounted for 
approximately $4 million of the difference between the interim rate level 
and the amount allowed in the Order. After a limited rehearing of 
the double leverage issue, the IUB issued its "Order On Rehearing" in 
December 1992, which affirmed the original decision.

IE appealed the IUB's Order to the Iowa District Court (Court). In
December 1993, the Court issued its decision, which upholds the IUB's Order.
The Company did not appeal the Court's decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.

In the second quarter of 1993, IE refunded approximately $4.1 million,
including interest, which represented a refund down to the level of revenues
that would have resulted had it won the appeal. An additional refund, 
including interest, of $8.7 million is required at December 31, 1993, as a 
result of the Court's decision. The refund is expected to be completed in 
the second quarter of 1994. There will be no effect on electric revenues 
and net income when the additional refund is made because the Company has 
been reserving for the effect of the additional refund.

(5) LEASES:

The Company has a capital lease covering its 70% undivided interest in
nuclear fuel purchased for the DAEC. Future purchases of fuel may also be 
added to the fuel lease. This lease provides for annual one year extensions 
and the Company intends to exercise such extensions through the DAEC's 
operating life. Interest costs under the lease are based on commercial paper 
costs incurred by the lessor. The Company is responsible for the payment of 
taxes, maintenance, operating cost, risk of loss and insurance relating 
to the leased fuel.

The lessor has an $80 million credit agreement with a bank supporting the
nuclear fuel lease. The agreement continues on a year to year basis, unless
either party provides at least a three year notice of termination; no such
notice of termination has been provided by either party.

Annual nuclear fuel lease expenses include the cost of fuel, based on the
quantity of heat produced for the generation of electric energy, plus the
lessor's interest costs related to fuel in the reactor and administrative
expenses. These expenses (included in "Fuel for production" in the Statements
of Income) for 1993-1991 were $12.4 million, $12.9 million and $17.5 million,
respectively.

The Company's operating lease rental expenses for 1993-1991 were
$8.4 million, $6.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively.

The Company's future minimum lease payments by year are as follows:
Capital Operating

(6) UTILITY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE:

Customer accounts receivable, including unbilled revenues, arise 
primarily from the sale of electricity and natural gas. At 
December 31, 1993, the Company was serving a diversified base of residential, 
commercial and industrial customers consisting of approximately 
325,000 electric and 170,000 gas customers.

The Company has entered into two agreements, one with limited recourse, to
sell undivided fractional interests of an aggregate of $65 million in its pool
of utility accounts receivable. At December 31, 1993, $53.2 million was sold
under the agreements. The agreements expire in June and December 1994. The
Company intends to consolidate the agreements into one new agreement in 1994.

(7) INCOME TAXES:

The components of federal and state income taxes for the years ended
December 31, were as follows:
1993 1992 1991 
(in millions) 
Classified as Federal and
State Income Taxes:
Current tax expense $ 28.4 $ 24.0 $ 36.3
Deferred tax expense 15.9 0.2 (10.1)
Amortization and adjustment
of investment tax credits (4.9) (2.8) (2.9)
39.4 21.4 23.3

Included in Miscellaneous, net:
Current tax expense (0.9) (0.8) 0.4
Deferred tax expense (0.5) 0.1 (0.2)
(1.4) (0.7) 0.2
Total income tax expense $ 38.0 $ 20.7 $ 23.5

The overall effective income tax rates shown below were computed by
dividing total income tax expense by income before income taxes.

Year Ended December 31
1993 1992 1991

Statutory Federal income tax rate 35.0% 34.0% 34.0%
Add (deduct):
Amortization of investment tax credits (2.5) (4.2) (4.0)
State income taxes, net of Federal
benefits 5.8 5.6 6.4
Property basis and other temporary 
differences for which deferred taxes are 
not provided under ratemaking principles 1.5 0.5 2.1
Reversal through tariffs of deferred
taxes provided at rates in excess
of the current statutory Federal
income tax rate (1.7) (2.7) (3.7)
Adjustment of prior period taxes (2.0) (2.0) (1.3)
Other items, net (0.3) 0.2 (0.4)
Overall effective income tax rate 35.8% 31.4% 33.1%

The accumulated deferred income taxes as set forth below and in the 
Balance Sheets arise from the following temporary differences:

December 31
1993 1992
(in millions)

Property related $ 272 $ 256
Decommissioning related (12) (11)
Investment tax credit related (30) (32)
Other 7 (7)
$ 237 $ 206

(8) BENEFIT PLANS:

The Company has one contributory and two non-contributory retirement plans
which, collectively, cover substantially all of its employees. Plan benefits
are generally based on years of service and compensation during the employees'
latter years of employment. Payments made from the pension funds to 
retired employees and beneficiaries during 1993 totaled $10.4 million. In 
addition to these payments, the Company purchased annuities totaling 
$6.3 million for all previous employees who had retired as of January 1993, 
under one of the plans. The cost of the annuities and the reduction 
in the projected benefit obligation were substantially equivalent.

The Company's policy is to fund the pension cost at an amount which is at
least equal to the minimum funding requirements mandated by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and which does not exceed the maximum 
tax deductible amount for the year.

Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 71, certain adjustments to the Company's
pension provision are necessary to reflect the accounting for pension costs
allowed in the most recent rate cases.

The components of the pension provision are as follows:

Year Ended December 31
1993 1992 1991
(in thousands)

Service cost $ 4,275 $ 4,439 $ 4,517
Interest cost on projected
benefit obligation 11,131 9,999 8,959
Assumed return on plans' assets (12,177) (11,640) (10,026)
Amortization of unrecognized gain (763) (135) (19)
Amortization of prior service cost 1,195 938 775
Amortization of unrecognized plans'
assets as of January 1, 1987 (384) (382) (392)
Pension cost 3,277 3,219 3,814
Adjustment to funding level (2,867) 301 (228)
Total pension costs paid to the
Trustees $ 410 $ 3,520 $ 3,586

Actual return on plans' assets $ 12,718 $ 8,861 $ 37,085

A reconciliation of the funded status of the plans to the amounts
recognized in the Balance Sheets is presented below:

December 31
1993 1992
(in thousands)

Fair market value of plans' assets $ 174,133 $ 177,514
Actuarial present value of benefits
rendered to date -
Accumulated benefits based on
compensation to date, including
vested benefits of $100,905,000
and $91,303,000, respectively 110,676 100,288
Additional benefits based on estimated
future salary levels 42,938 31,324
Projected benefit obligation 153,614 131,612
Plans' assets in excess of projected
benefit obligation 20,519 45,902
Remaining unrecognized net asset existing
at January 1, 1987, being amortized over
20 years (4,109) (5,256)
Unrecognized prior service cost 16,708 14,961
Unrecognized net gain (28,830) (52,709)
Prepaid pension cost recognized in the
Balance Sheets $ 4,288 $ 2,898

Assumed rate of return, all plans 8.00% 8.00%
Weighted average discount rate of
projected benefit obligation, all plans 7.50% 8.25%
Range of assumed rates of increase in 
future compensation levels for 
the plans 4.00-5.75% 4.00-5.75%

The decrease in the discount rate used to compute the projected benefit
obligation, from 8.25% at December 31, 1992 to 7.50% at December 31, 1993,
accounted for a significant portion of the reduction in the unrecognized net
gain between periods and, similarly, contributed to the increase in the 
projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1993.

The Company provides certain benefits to retirees (primarily health care
benefits). Through 1992, the Company expensed such costs as benefits were 
paid, which was consistent with ratemaking practices. Such costs totaled 
$2.2 million for 1992 and $1.9 million for 1991.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 106, which requires 
the accrual of the expected cost of postretirement benefits other than 
pensions during the employees' years of service. The IUB has adopted rules 
stating that postretirement benefits other than pensions will be included in 
rates pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 106. The rules permit the Company 
to amortize the transition obligation as of January 1, 1993 over 20 years 
and require that all amounts collected are to be funded into an external 
trust to pay benefits as they become due. Beginning in 1993, the gas 
portion of these costs is being recovered in the Company's gas rates, and are 
funded in external trust funds; recovery of the electric portion will be 
addressed in future electric proceedings. The IUB has adopted a rule that 
permits a deferral of the incremental electric SFAS 106 costs until the 
earlier of: 1) an order in an electric rate case, or 2) December 31, 1995. 
Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 71, the Company had deferred 
$2.9 million of such costs at December 31, 1993, and it expects to file 
electric rate cases seeking recovery of the deferred costs before
December 31, 1995.

The components of postretirement benefit costs for the year ended
December 31, 1993, are as follows:
1993
(in thousands)

Service cost $ 1,685
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation 3,247
Amortization of transition obligation existing
at January 1, 1993 2,024
Postretirement benefit costs 6,956
Less: Deferred postretirement benefit costs 2,858
Net postretirement benefit costs $ 4,098

A reconciliation of the funded status of the plans to the amounts
recognized in the Balance Sheets is presented below:

December 31, January 1, 
1993 1993
(in thousands)

Fair market value of plans' assets $ 1,171 $ -
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation -
Active employees not yet eligible 18,325 18,232
Active employees eligible 4,130 3,698
Retirees 20,140 18,558
Total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 42,595 40,488
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
in excess of plans' assets (41,424) (40,488)
Unrecognized transition obligation 38,463 40,488
Unrecognized net gain (1,167) -
Accrued postretirement benefit cost in the
Balance Sheets $ (4,128) $ -
Assumed rate of return 8.0% -
Weighted average discount rate of
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 7.5% 8.25%
Medical trend on paid charges:
Initial trend rate 12.0% 13.0%
Ultimate trend rate 6.5% 8.0%

The assumed medical trend rates are critical assumptions in determining 
the service cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to
postretirement benefit costs. A 1% change in the medical trend rates, holding
all other assumptions constant, would have changed the 1993 service cost by 
$1.1 million (22%) and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at 
December 31, 1993 by $6.7 million (16%).

The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 112 "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits" as of January 1, 1994 and its adoption will not
have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of 
operations. This statement requires that benefits offered to former or 
inactive employees after termination of employment, but before retirement, be 
accrued over the service lives of the employees if all of the following 
conditions are met: 1) the obligation relates to services already performed, 
2) the employees' rights vest, 3) the payments are probable, and 4) the 
amounts are reasonably determinable. Otherwise, such obligations are to be 
recognized at the time they become probable and reasonably determinable. 
The Company has generally accounted for these obligations as they were paid.

(9) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK:

The Company has 466,406 shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock, $50 par
value, authorized for issuance at December 31, 1993, of which the 6.10%, 
4.80% and 4.30% Series had 100,000, 146,406 and 120,000 shares, respectively,
outstanding at both December 31, 1993 and 1992. These shares are redeemable 
at the Company's option upon 30 days notice at $51.00, $50.25 and $51.00 per 
share, respectively, plus accrued dividends.

The Company also has 700,000 shares of Cumulative Preference Stock 
($100 par value) authorized for issuance, of which none were outstanding at
December 31, 1993.

(10) DEBT:
(a) Long-Term Debt -

In November 1993, the Company entered into arrangements with various 
cities in the State of Iowa (Cities), whereby the Cities issued an aggregate 
of $19.4 million of pollution control revenue refunding bonds (PCRRBs), all 
at 5.5%, due 2023. Each series of the PCRRBs is secured, in part, by 
payments on a corresponding principal amount of Collateral Trust Bonds, 
at 5.5%, due 2023. The proceeds received by the Company in the transaction 
were used to redeem $10.2 million of Pollution Control Obligations, 5.75%, due 
serially 1995-2003 and an aggregate of $9.2 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 
Series P & Q, 6.7%, due 2006.

In October 1993, the Company sold $100 million aggregate principal amount
of Collateral Trust Bonds, 6% Series, due 2008, and 7% Series, due 2023. A
portion of the proceeds from the Collateral Trust Bonds was used to retire
short-term debt, with the balance used for general corporate purposes, 
including support of its construction program.

In May 1993, the Company redeemed First Mortgage Bonds Series K, 8-5/8%,
principal amount of $20 million, and Series R, 8-1/4%, principal amount of 
$25 million and First Mortgage Bonds Series 8-3/4%, principal amount of 
$15 million. The redemptions were completed with proceeds from short-term 
borrowings and, as discussed above, long-term debt was ultimately issued to 
replace the short-term borrowings.

The Company's Indentures and Deeds of Trust securing its First Mortgage
Bonds constitute direct first mortgage liens upon substantially all tangible
public utility property. The Company's Indenture and Deed of Trust securing 
its Collateral Trust Bonds constitutes a second lien on substantially all 
tangible public utility property while First Mortgage Bonds remain 
outstanding.

Total sinking fund requirements, which the Company intends to meet by
pledging additional property under the terms of the Company's Indentures and
Deeds of Trust, and debt maturities for 1994-1998 are as follows:

Debt maturities
(in thousands)

$1,004 $100,920 $ 15,770 $ 8,690 $ 690

The Company intends to refinance the majority of the debt maturities with
long-term debt.

(b) Short-Term Debt -

At December 31, 1993, the Company had bank lines of credit aggregating
$67.7 million and was using $19.0 million to support commercial paper and 
$7.7 million to support certain pollution control obligations. Commitment 
fees are paid to maintain these lines and there are no conditions which 
restrict the unused lines of credit. In addition to the above, the Company 
has an uncommitted credit facility with a financial institution whereby it 
can borrow up to $50 million. Rates are set at the time of borrowing and no 
fees are paid to maintain this facility. At December 31, 1993, $5.0 million 
was borrowed at 3.4% under this facility. The Company also has a letter 
of credit in the amount of $3.4 million supporting two of its variable 
rate pollution control obligations.

(11) ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The estimated fair values of financial instruments at December 31, 1993,
and the basis upon which they were estimated are as follows:

Current assets and current liabilities -
The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of such financial instruments.

Nuclear decommissioning trust funds -
The estimated fair value of these trust funds, as reported by the
trustee based upon current market values, is $29.5 million.

Cumulative preferred stock -
The estimated fair value of this stock of $12.8 million is based
upon quoted market prices.

Long-term debt -
The carrying amount of long-term debt was $480 million compared to
estimated fair value of $507 million. The estimated fair value of
long-term debt is based upon quoted market prices.

Since the Company is subject to regulation, any gains or losses related 
to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of financial
instruments may not be realized by the Company's parent.

(12) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
(a) Construction Program -

The Company's construction and acquisition program anticipates 
expenditures of approximately $150 million, for which substantial commitments 
have been made.

(b) Purchase Power Contracts -

The Company has a purchase power contract with Terra Comfort Company 
(Terra Comfort), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Industries, for annual capacity 
purchases of 114 Mw that expires on December 31, 1994.

In connection with the acquisition of the UE properties discussed in
Note 3, the Company is purchasing power from UE under a five-year firm 
capacity contract with a 1994 requirement of 120 Mw of delivered capacity 
declining to 60 Mw in 1997. The Company will also purchase an additional 
maximum interruptible capacity of up to 54 Mw of 25 Hz power. This 25 Hz 
power purchase will extend through 1998 and will continue thereafter unless 
either party gives a three-year notice of cancellation.

The costs of capacity purchases for these contracts are reflected in
"Purchased power" in the Statements of Income.

Total capacity charges under all existing contracts will approximate 
$21.0 million, $14.7 million, $11.4 million, $8.7 million and $0.3 million 
for the years 1994-1998, respectively.

(c) Coal Contract Commitments -

The Company has entered into coal supply contracts which expire between
1994 and 2001 for its fossil-fueled generating stations. At December 31, 
1993, the contracts cover approximately $147 million of coal over the life 
of the contracts, which includes $34 million expected to be incurred in 
1994. The Company expects to supplement these coal contracts with spot 
market purchases to fulfill its future fossil fuel needs.

(d) Information Technology Services -

In 1992, the Company entered into an agreement with Electronic Data 
Systems Corporation (EDS) for information technology services. The term of 
the contract is twelve years and the contract is subject to declining 
termination fees. The Company's anticipated expenditures under the agreement 
for 1994 are estimated to be approximately $8.9 million. Future costs under
the agreement are variable and are dependent upon the Company's level of 
usage of technological services from EDS, as well as inflation.

(e) Nuclear Insurance Programs -

The Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 (1988 Act) provides the Company
with the benefit of $9.4 billion of public liability coverage consisting of 
$200 million of insurance and $9.2 billion of potential retroactive 
assessments from the owners of nuclear power plants. Under the 1988 Act, 
the Company could be assessed a maximum of $79 million per nuclear incident, 
with a maximum of $10 million per year (of which the Company's 70% ownership 
portion would be $55 million and $7 million, respectively) if losses 
relating to the incidents exceeded $200 million. These limits are subject to 
adjustments for inflation in future years.

Pursuant to provisions in various nuclear insurance policies, the Company
could be assessed retroactive premiums in connection with future accidents at
a nuclear facility owned by a utility participating in the particular 
insurance plan. With respect to excess property damage and replacement 
power coverages, the Company could be assessed annually a maximum of 
$8.5 million and $1 million, respectively, if the insurer's losses relating 
to accidents exceeded its reserves. While assessments may also be made for 
losses in certain prior years, the Company is not aware of any losses in such 
years that it believes are likely to result in an assessment.

(f) Environmental Liabilities -

At December 31, 1993, the Company's Balance Sheet reflects $13.1 million
(including $4.0 million as current) of environmental liabilities, which,
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, represents the minimum 
amount of the estimated range of such costs that the Company expects to 
incur. The minimum amount of the range is used because no amount within 
the range represents a better estimate. These estimates are subject to 
continuing review.

The Company has been named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) for
certain former manufactured gas plant (FMGP) sites by either the Iowa 
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) or the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA). The Company is working with the IDNR and EPA to investigate 
its 27 sites and to determine the appropriate remediation activities that may 
be needed to mitigate health and environmental concerns. Such investigations 
are expected to be completed by 1999 and site-specific remediations are 
anticipated to be completed within 3 years after the completion of the 
investigations of each site. The Company may be required to monitor these 
sites for a number of years upon completion of remediation.

The Company is investigating the possibility of insurance and third party
cost sharing for FMGP clean-up costs. The amount of shared costs, if any, can
not be reasonably determined and, accordingly, no potential sharing has been
recorded. Regulatory assets of $12.9 million have been recorded in the 
Balance Sheets, which reflects the future recovery that is being provided 
through the Company's rates (See Note 2(a)). Considering the recorded 
reserves for environmental liabilities and the past rate treatment 
allowed by the IUB, management believes that the clean-up costs incurred 
by the Company for these FMGP sites will not have a material adverse effect on 
its financial position or results of operations.

(g) Clean Air Act -

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Act) requires emission reductions 
of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides to achieve reductions of atmospheric
chemicals believed to cause acid rain. The provisions of the Act will be 
implemented in two phases with Phase I affecting two of the Company's units 
beginning in 1995 and Phase II affecting all units beginning in the 
year 2000.

The Company expects to meet the requirements of the Act by switching to
lower sulfur fuels and through capital expenditures primarily related to fuel
burning equipment and boiler modifications. The Company estimates capital
expenditures at approximately $28 million, including $4 million in 1994, in
order to meet these requirements of the Act.

(h) National Energy Policy Act of 1992 -

The National Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires owners of nuclear power
plants to pay a special assessment into a "Uranium Enrichment Decontamination
and Decommissioning Fund." The assessment is based upon prior nuclear fuel
purchases and, for the DAEC, averages $1.3 million annually through 2007, 
of which the Company's 70% share is $0.9 million. The Company is recovering 
the costs associated with this assessment through its electric fuel adjustment 
clauses over the period the costs are assessed. The Company's 70% share of 
the future assessment, $12.7 million payable through 2007, has been recorded 
as a liability in the Balance Sheets, including $0.7 million included 
in "Current liabilities - other," with a related regulatory asset for the 
unrecovered amount (See Note 2(a)).

(i) FERC Order No. 636 -

The FERC issued Order No. 636 (Order 636) in 1992. Order 636 as modified
on rehearing, (1) requires the Company's pipeline suppliers to unbundle their
services so that gas supplies are obtained separately from transportation
service, and transportation and storage services are operated and billed as
separate and distinct services, (2) requires the pipeline suppliers to offer 
"no notice" transportation service under which firm transporters (such as the
Company) can receive delivery of gas up to their contractual capacity level on
any day without prior scheduling, (3) allows pipelines to abandon long-term 
(one year or more) transportation service to a customer whenever the customer 
fails to match the highest rate and longest term (up to 20 years) offered to 
the pipeline by other customers for the particular capacity, and (4) provides 
for a mechanism under which pipelines can recover prudently incurred 
transition costs associated with the restructuring process. The Company may 
benefit from enhanced access to competitively priced gas supply and more 
flexible transportation services as a result of Order 636. However, the 
Company will be required to pay certain transition costs passed on from its 
pipeline suppliers as they implement Order 636.

The Company's three pipeline suppliers have filed new tariffs with the 
FERC implementing Order 636 and the pipelines have also made filings with the 
FERC to begin collecting their respective transition costs. The Company 
began paying the transition costs in November 1993, and has recorded a 
liability of $5.0 million for such transition costs that have been 
incurred by the pipelines to date, including $1.7 million expected to be 
billed in 1994. While the magnitude of the total transition costs to be 
charged to the Company cannot yet be determined, the Company believes any 
transition costs the FERC would allow the pipelines to collect would be 
recovered from its customers, based upon past regulatory treatment of 
similar costs by the IUB. Accordingly, regulatory assets, in amounts 
corresponding to the liabilities, have been recorded to reflect the
anticipated recovery.

(13) JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT:

Under joint ownership agreements with other Iowa utilities, the Company 
has undivided ownership interests in jointly-owned electric generating 
stations and related transmission facilities. Each of the respective owners

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The following discussion analyzes significant changes in the components 
of net income and financial condition during the years 1993 and 1992. See 
Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of the merger 
of Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (IE) and Iowa Southern Utilities 
Company (IS), effective December 31, 1993, that formed the Company.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company's net income increased $23.5 million during 1993 and
decreased $1.8 million during 1992. The 1993 results reflect the acquisition
of the Iowa service territory of Union Electric Company (UE) (as discussed in
Note 3 of the Notes to Financial Statements) and a return to more normal 
weather conditions in the Company's service territory. The floods in Iowa 
in 1993 did not significantly affect the Company's results of operations. 
The 1992 results were adversely affected by extremely cool summer weather and 
a mild winter in the Company's service territory.

The Company's operating income increased $25.0 million and $0.6 million
during 1993 and 1992, respectively, as compared to prior years. Reasons for
the changes in the results of operations are explained in the following 
discussion.

ELECTRIC REVENUES

Electric revenues and Kwh sales (excluding off-system sales) increased
$87.5 million and 25%, respectively, during 1993. In 1992, electric revenues
and Kwh sales decreased $19.6 million and 1.5%, respectively. The 1993 sales
increase is attributable to the acquisition of the UE territory and a return 
to more normal weather conditions. After adjusting for these items, 
underlying electric sales increased 6% in 1993, which reflects the economic 
growth in the industrial and commercial customer base.

The 1992 Kwh sales decrease reflects unusually mild weather conditions in
the Company's service territory. Residential sales, which are the most 
weather sensitive, decreased 9.5%. However, industrial sales, which are less 
sensitive to weather, increased approximately 5.5%. Adjusting for the 
effects of weather, Kwh sales increased 2.7%, reflecting economic growth in 
the Company's service territory.

The Company's electric tariffs include energy adjustment clauses (EAC)
that are designed to currently recover the costs of fuel and the energy 
portion of purchased power billings to customers. See Note 2(g) of the Notes 
to Financial Statements for discussion of the EAC. The increase in electric 
revenues for 1993 is primarily because of the sales increase and increased 
recovery of fuel costs through the EAC.

The revenue decrease in 1992 was primarily related to the lower Kwh sales
discussed above and lower off-system sales to other utilities. A rate decrease
in the former IS service territory that became effective in September 1991
contributed to the revenue decrease to a lesser extent. These items were
partially offset by the effect of the rate increase in the former IE service
territory that became effective in December 1991. See Note 4(b) of the 
Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of the electric rate case 
in the former IE service territory.

GAS REVENUES

Gas revenues increased $14.9 million and $8.4 million during 1993 and
1992, respectively. Gas sales in therms (including transported volumes) 
increased 5.3% in 1993 and were flat in 1992. Gas sales also reflect the 
effects of weather. Adjusting for the effects of weather, gas sales decreased 
1.5% in 1993 and increased 1.5% in 1992.

The Company's tariffs include purchased gas adjustment clauses (PGA) that
are designed to currently recover the cost of gas sold. See Note 2(g) of the
Notes to Financial Statements for discussion of the PGA.

Gas revenues increased in 1993 and 1992 substantially because of 
increased costs of gas recovered through the PGA and the effect of gas rate 
increases in the former service territory of both IE and IS, that became 
effective in September 1992. The 1993 sales increase also contributed 
to the revenue increase for that year. See Note 4(a) of the Notes to 
Financial Statements for a discussion of the gas rate increases.

STEAM REVENUES

Steam revenues increased $1.1 million during 1993 and decreased $0.6
million during 1992, primarily related to fluctuations in sales volumes among
large industrial customers.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Fuel for production increased $14.3 million in 1993 because of increased
availability of the Company's fossil-fueled generating stations, which
experienced extended maintenance outages in 1992, and because of increased
sales. Fuel for production decreased $17.8 million during 1992 primarily 
because of a nuclear refueling outage at the Duane Arnold Energy Center 
(DAEC), maintenance outages at the fossil-fueled generating stations and 
the lower electric sales. There were refueling outages in 1993 and 1992, but
no such outage in 1991. The decrease in Kwh generation during the refueling 
and maintenance outages was substantially replaced by purchased power.

Purchased power increased $18.7 million in 1993, of which approximately
$14.7 million represents increased energy purchases and approximately $4.0
million is a net increase in capacity charges. The increase in energy
purchases is because of the increased Kwh sales. The increased capacity 
costs reflect the contracts associated with the acquisition of the UE service 
territory, partially offset by the expiration, in April 1993, of the purchase 
power agreement with the City of Muscatine. (See Note 12(b) of the Notes 
to Financial Statements). Purchased power increased $4.5 million in 1992 
because of increased purchases during the refueling and maintenance outages, 
partially offset by lower purchases related to lower off-system sales.

Gas purchased for resale increased $7.5 million and $5.1 million during
1993 and 1992, respectively. The increases are primarily because of increased
per unit gas costs, and in 1993, increased sales.

Other operating expenses increased $3.6 million in 1993 and decreased 
$5.2 million during 1992. The 1993 increase is primarily because of 
increased labor and benefit costs and higher electric and gas transmission 
and distribution costs, partially offset by lower non-labor costs at the 
DAEC. The 1992 decrease was substantially related to a regulatory 
disallowance of $3.9 million recorded in April 1991, after the Iowa Utilities 
Board (IUB) denied recovery of previously deferred former manufactured gas 
plant (FMGP) clean-up costs. Lower non-labor costs at the DAEC and lower 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees, partially offset by increased labor and 
benefit costs, also affected 1992.

Maintenance expenses increased $6.6 million during 1993 and were flat in
1992. The 1993 increase is primarily because of increased maintenance at the
Company's fossil-fueled generating stations and the DAEC. The 1992 maintenance
expenses reflect increased maintenance at fossil-fueled generating stations,
substantially offset by lower maintenance costs at the DAEC.

Depreciation and amortization increased during both years primarily
because of increases in utility plant in service, including the 
acquisition of the UE territory on December 31, 1992. An increase in the 
average gas utility property depreciation rate, resulting from an updated 
depreciation study, also contributed to the 1993 increase. Depreciation and 
amortization expenses for both years include $5.5 million for the DAEC 
decommissioning provision, which is collected through rates.

Property taxes increased $4.8 million during 1993, primarily because of
the acquisition of the UE service territory and increases in assessed values.

Federal and state income taxes included in operating expenses increased
$18.0 million in 1993 primarily because of increases in taxable income and an
increase of 1% in the Federal statutory income tax rate. Such income taxes
decreased $1.9 million in 1992 primarily because of adjustments of 
$1.5 million recorded in the second quarter of 1992 to previously recorded 
tax reserves and a reduction in taxable income.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense (long-term debt and other combined) increased in 1993 
and 1992 primarily because of an increase in the average amount of debt
outstanding. A reduction in the average interest rate in 1993 substantially 
offset the effect of the higher average outstanding debt. The lower average 
interest rate reflects the refinancing of certain long-term debt issues at 
lower rates and lower-cost short-term borrowings outstanding for interim 
periods between the redemption of certain long-term debt series and the 
issuance of their long-term replacements. Interest expense related to the 
Company's reserves for rate refunds also contributed to the increase in 1992.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's capital requirements are primarily attributable to its
construction programs and debt maturities. Cash and temporary cash investments
increased $16.6 million during 1993. In 1993, cash flows from operating
activities were $149 million. These funds were primarily used for construction
and acquisition expenditures and to pay dividends.

It is anticipated that the Company's future capital requirements will be
met by cash generated from operations and external financing. The level of
cash generated from operations is partially dependent upon economic conditions,
legislative activities, environmental matters and timely rate relief. (See
Notes 4 and 12 of the Notes to Financial Statements). Access to the long-term
and short-term capital and credit markets is necessary for obtaining funds
externally.

The Company's liquidity and capital resources will be affected by
environmental and legislative issues, including the ultimate disposition of
remediation issues surrounding the FMGP issue, the Clean Air Act as amended,
the National Energy Policy Act of 1992, and Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) Order 636, as discussed in Note 12 of the Notes to 
Financial Statements. Consistent with rate making principles of the IUB, 
management believes that the costs incurred for the above matters will 
not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of 
operations of the Company.

The IUB has adopted rules which require the Company to spend 2% of
electric and 1.5% of gas gross retail operating revenues annually for energy 
efficiency programs. Energy efficiency costs in excess of the amount in the 
most recent electric and gas rate cases are being recorded as regulatory 
assets. At December 31, 1993, the Company had $18.5 million of such costs 
recorded as regulatory assets. The Company will make its initial filing for 
recovery of the costs in 1994.

CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITION PROGRAM

The Company's construction and acquisition program anticipates
expenditures of $150 million for 1994, of which approximately 44% represents 
expenditures for electric transmission and distribution facilities, 18% 
represents fossil-fueled generation expenditures and 10% represents 
nuclear generation expenditures. Substantial commitments have been made in 
connection with such expenditures.

The Company's levels of construction and acquisition expenditures are
projected to be $149 million in 1995, $144 million in 1996, $149 million in
1997 and $160 million in 1998. It is estimated that approximately 80% of
construction expenditures will be provided by cash from operating activities 
(after payment of dividends) for the five year period 1994-1998.

Capital expenditure and investment and financing plans are subject to
continual review and change. The capital expenditure and investment program
may be revised significantly as a result of many considerations including 
changes in economic conditions, variations in actual sales and load growth 
compared to forecasts, requirements of environmental, nuclear and other 
regulatory authorities, acquisition opportunities, the availability of 
alternate energy and purchased power sources, the ability to obtain adequate 
and timely rate relief, escalations in construction costs and 
conservation and energy efficiency programs.

LONG-TERM FINANCING

Other than periodic sinking fund requirements which the Company intends to
meet by pledging additional property, $124 million of long-term debt, including
four series of First Mortgage Bonds aggregating $123 million, will mature prior
to December 31, 1998. The Company intends to refinance the majority of the
debt maturities with long-term debt.

In order to provide an up-to-date instrument for the issuance of bonds,
notes or other evidence of indebtedness, the Company has entered into an
Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated September 1, 1993 (New Mortgage).
The lien of the New Mortgage is subordinate to the lien of the Company's first
mortgages until such time as all bonds issued under the first mortgages have
been retired and such mortgages satisfied. The New Mortgage provides for, 
among other things, the issuance of Collateral Trust Bonds upon the basis of 
First Mortgage Bonds being issued. Accordingly, to the extent that the 
Company issues Collateral Trust Bonds on the basis of First Mortgage Bonds, 
it must comply with the requirements for the issuance of First Mortgage 
Bonds under the Company's first mortgages. Under the terms of the New 
Mortgage, the Company has covenanted not to issue any additional First 
Mortgage Bonds under its first mortgages except to provide the basis for 
issuance of Collateral Trust Bonds.

In November 1993, the Company entered into arrangements with various
cities in the State of Iowa (Cities), whereby the Cities issued an aggregate 
of $19.4 million of pollution control revenue refunding bonds (PCRRBs), 
all at 5.5%, due 2023. Each series of the PCRRBs is secured, in part, by 
payments on a corresponding principal amount of Collateral Trust Bonds, at 
5.5%, due 2023. The proceeds received by the Company in the transaction were 
used to redeem $10.2 million of Pollution Control Obligations, 5.75%, due 
serially 1995-2003 and an aggregate of $9.2 million of First Mortgage Bonds, 
Series P & Q, 6.7%, due 2006.

In October 1993, the Company sold $100 million aggregate principal amount
of Collateral Trust Bonds, 6% Series, due 2008, and 7% Series, due 2023. A
portion of the proceeds from the Collateral Trust Bonds was used to retire
short-term debt, with the balance used for general corporate purposes, 
including support of the Company's construction program.

In May 1993, the Company redeemed First Mortgage Bonds Series K, 8-5/8%,
principal amount of $20 million, and Series R, 8-1/4%, principal amount of 
$25 million and First Mortgage Bonds Series 8-3/4%, principal amount of $15
million. The redemptions were completed with proceeds from short-term 
borrowings and, as discussed above, long-term debt was ultimately issued to 
replace the short-term borrowings.

The Indentures pursuant to which the Company issues First Mortgage Bonds
constitute direct first mortgage liens upon substantially all tangible public
utility property and contain covenants which restrict the amount of additional
bonds which may be issued. At December 31, 1993, such restrictions would have
allowed the Company to issue $258 million of additional First Mortgage Bonds.
The Company intends to file in the first quarter of 1994 with the FERC for
authority to issue $250 million of long-term debt. The Company is currently
authorized by the SEC to issue $50 million of long-term debt under an existing
registration statement. The Company expects to issue up to $150 million in
1994. The proceeds are expected to be used for the early redemption of three
series of First Mortgage Bonds aggregating $55 million, which have not yet 
been called, and for general corporate purposes, including support of its
construction program.

The Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize and limit the
aggregate amount of additional shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock and
Cumulative Preference Stock which may be issued. At December 31, 1993, the
Company could have issued an additional 700,000 shares of Cumulative Preference
Stock and 100,000 additional shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock.

The Company's capitalization ratios at year-end were as follows:

1993 1992

Long-term debt 48% 50%
Preferred stock 2 2
Common equity 50 48
100% 100%

SHORT-TERM FINANCING

For interim financing, the Company is authorized by the FERC to issue,
through 1994, up to $125 million of short-term notes. This availability of
short-term financing provides the Company flexibility in the issuance of
long-term securities. At December 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding
short-term borrowings of $24 million.

The Company has two agreements, both of which expire in 1994, with
separate financial institutions to sell up to $65 million of its utility 
accounts receivable. The Company intends to consolidate the agreements 
into one new agreement in 1994. At December 31, 1993, the Company had sold 
$53.2 million under the agreements.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had bank lines of credit aggregating
$67.7 million and was using $19.0 million of its lines to support commercial
paper and $7.7 million to support certain pollution control obligations.
Commitment fees are paid to maintain these lines and there are no conditions
which restrict the unused lines of credit. In addition to the above, the
Company has an uncommitted credit facility with a financial institution 
whereby it can borrow up to $50 million. Rates are set at the time of 
borrowing and no fees are paid to maintain this facility. At December 31, 
1993, $5.0 million was borrowed at 3.4% under this facility. The Company 
also has a letter of credit in the amount of $3.4 million supporting two 
of its variable rate pollution control obligations.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

Under the rate making principles prescribed by the regulatory commissions
to which the Company is subject, only the historical cost of plant is
recoverable in revenues as depreciation. As a result, the Company has 
experienced economic losses equivalent to the current year's impact of 
inflation on utility plant.

In addition, the regulatory process imposes a substantial time lag between
the time when operating and capital costs are incurred and when they are
recovered. The Company does not expect the effects of inflation at current
levels to have a significant effect on its results of operations.
