Item 5. Other Information

Legislation has been approved by the Minnesota Senate Jobs, Energy and
Community Development Committee by a 9 to 4 vote in support of the Company's
plan to store additional spent nuclear fuel at its Prairie Island Nuclear
Generating Plant. A nearly identical bill has been approved by a 13 to 7
vote in the state House Regulated Industries and Energy Committee. However,
the state Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee, on a vote of
10 to 8, rejected the bill. The bill is currently before the House
Environment Committee. The Company is pursuing every available option to
bring this legislation to a vote on the Senate and House floors before the
end of the legislative session, which is expected to be about May 1, 1994.

The Company has received official notification that the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) membership has rejected a three-year
contract offer by nearly a 2 to 1 margin. Eighty-nine percent of the
eligible IBEW members cast ballots. Representatives from the IBEW and the
Company will continue discussions on March 21, 1994. An interim agreement 
remains in effect until March 31, 1994, and attempts will be made to extend
these contract provisions through May 1994.
