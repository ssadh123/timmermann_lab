Form 8-K American Telephone and Telegraph Company

Item 5. Other Events. 

On January 27, 1994, American Telephone and Telegraph Company ("AT&T")
announced that its net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $982
million ($0.72 per share). The amount reported includes the impact of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 ("SFAS No. 112"),
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" and restructuring
charges at NCR Corporation ("NCR")(which has been renamed AT&T Global
Information Solutions Company). Excluding the impact of these two items,
fourth quarter 1993 net income was $1.15 billion ($0.85 per share) compared
with $1.00 billion ($0.75 per share) in the fourth quarter of 1992. 
Revenues for the fourth quarter were $18.46 billion as compared to $17.50
billion in the fourth quarter of 1992.

AT&T reported a loss of $3.79 billion for the year 1993 ($2.80 per
share) which reflected previously announced noncash charges for accounting
changes of $7.02 billion after taxes relating to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" and $1.30 billion after taxes relating to
SFAS No. 112. These items were partially offset by the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" effective January 1, 1993 which resulted in a $383 million gain. 
Excluding the net impact of the accounting changes and fourth-quarter
restructuring at NCR, net income for 1993 was $4.26 billion ($3.15 per
share), on revenues of $67.16 billion. Net income for 1992 was $3.81
billion ($2.86 per share), on revenues of $64.90 billion. <PAGE>
