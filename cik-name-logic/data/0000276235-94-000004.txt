EXHIBIT 28.1

November 29, 1993

Mr. William F. Shumadine, Jr.
415 Kilmarnock Drive
Richmond, Virginia 23229

Dear Bill:

The following constitutes an agreement (the "Agreement") between 
you and Central Fidelity Banks, Inc. (the "Corporation") concerning the 
terms and conditions of your separation from employment with the 
Corporation effective October 21, 1993 ("Separation Date") and your 
consulting relationship with the Corporation for a period of time 
thereafter.

I. SALARY CONTINUATION

You will receive regular, periodic salary payments from November 
1, 1993 through April 30, 1996 ("Continuation Payments"), based upon an 
amount that is equal to two and one-half (2 1/2) times your basic annual 
salary on the Separation Date divided into equal semi-monthly 
installments over the period, less appropriate authorized deductions. 
Continuation Payments will cease upon your death prior to the end of the 
period.

II. SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT

You are ineligible to receive benefits under the terms of the 
Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Excess Pension Plan. 
However, in view of your twenty-seven years of dedicated and 
distinguished service to the Corporation, the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation has authorized the payment to you of a supplemental 
retirement benefit which will include two components.

(a) Beginning at age 55, you will receive $99,886.02 per year for 
twenty years, payable in semi-monthly installments. These benefits will 
not cease upon your death prior to the end of that period, and you may 
designate a beneficiary to receive the unpaid balance of those payments.

(b) You will receive a benefit calculated as if you were an 
active participant in the Corporation's pension plan in effect on May 1, 
1996 but without regard to any IRS limitations on benefits, specifically 
including Sections 415 and 401(a)(17). You will receive this benefit 
only in accordance with and at the same time as you commence receiving 
vested benefits under the Corporation's pension plan. Benefits 
calculated and payable as described above will be offset by actual 
payments received from the Corporation's pension plan.

These benefits represent an unsecured promise of payment by the 
Corporation. No assets are required to be segregated or set aside for 
the purpose of funding these benefits, and even if the Corporation 
chooses to "earmark" assets for this purpose, you would have no right, 
title, interest in, or claim to those assets. However, you will have 
the same coverage as to segregation of assets in the event of a "change 
of control" as provided in the Corporation's Executive Supplemental 
Retirement Plan.

III. PENSION PLAN

You are currently vested in the Corporation's pension plan but you 
will not continue to accrue service after November 1, 1993.

IV. OTHER PLANS

You will continue to participate in the following plans on the 
same basis as active employees through the last day of the last month in 
which you receive Continuation Payments.

Medical
Life/Accident Insurance
Stock & Thrift Plan and/or Supplemental Stock & Thrift Plan 
as permitted by applicable regulations.

V. STOCK OPTIONS

Your Central Fidelity stock options may be exercised at any time 
during the 2 1/2 year period of Continuation Payments and for 90 days 
thereafter and will expire on July 31, 1996. As of January 21, 1994, 
these stock options become non-qualified stock options under Section 422 
of the Internal Revenue Code.

VI. CONSULTING, CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-COMPETITION

For no additional compensation, you agree to make yourself 
available for the purpose of consulting with the Corporation from time 
to time during the period which you are receiving Continuation Payments. 
In is understood that the times on which the Corporation may call upon 
you for consultation should be times reasonably convenient for you, but 
you are not expected to maintain regular office hours for this purpose.

You agree not to divulge confidential information concerning the 
Corporation to anyone unless compelled to do so by legal process. 
"Confidential information" means information which is not a matter of 
public record, or which is not generally known to members of the general 
public, concerning the operations, policies, personnel, employment 
practices or business strategies of the Corporation that you learned 
during the course of your employment. In addition, you agree to assist 
the Corporation and its designated agents in the discussion and 
investigation of any matters of which you have knowledge pertaining to 
events during your employment with the Corporation. We mutually agree 
that both you and the Corporation will not make any disparaging or 

derogatory statements about the other party including any remarks about 
the directors or officers of the Corporation.

Further, you agree that during the period that Continuation 
Payments are made, you will neither seek nor accept an executive or 
consulting position with any depository banking organization within 
the Commonwealth of Virginia. This restriction upon your employment by 
a competitor of the Corporation would not preclude your ownership of 
stock in any such competitor or your employment by an investment 
management or investment banking organization.

VII. EFFECTIVE DATE AND REPLACEMENT OF PRIOR AGREEMENT

This Agreement is effective in its entirety immediately and 
supersedes and replaces all previous employment contracts between you 
and the Corporation.
