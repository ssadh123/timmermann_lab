MULTIMEDIA ELECTS PROGRAMMING/BROADCASTING EXECUTIVE 
DOUG GREENLAW PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

GREENVILLE, S.C. - JULY 21, 1994 -- Multimedia, Inc. today
announced that its board of directors has elected Douglas J.
Greenlaw, 49, as president and chief operating officer, effective
Aug. 1, 1994. 

Greenlaw, formerly chairman and chief executive officer of the
Ventures Division of Whittle Communications Ltd., has served in
several senior positions in the media industry. In 1982 he
became executive vice president of The Family Channel, where he
built the fledgling cable network's marketing organization.

From 1987 to 1991, Greenlaw was executive vice president of MTV
Networks, Inc., a subsidiary of Viacom, Inc. While at MTV he
headed the Syndications Division as well as Sales & Marketing for
the MTV, VH-1, Nickelodeon and Nick-at-Nite channels. He left
Viacom in 1991 to serve as president of Channel One, Whittle's
innovative educational cable network that reaches approximately
12,000 classrooms. He was promoted in 1994 to his most recent
position at Whittle, where he was responsible for developing new
media opportunities.

A graduate of Indiana University, Greenlaw spent his early career
in radio station sales at ABC and Heftel Broadcasting.

Don Sbarra, Multimedia's chairman and chief executive officer,
said, "In Doug Greenlaw we have selected a proven executive who
understands equally the key drivers of our company's future
success - programming and advertising sales."

Sbarra continued, "We have always said that one of Multimedia's
greatest strengths is the diversity of its assets, which are
about equally divided among four distinct media businesses. 
Exciting opportunities exist for companies with the vision and
resources to take advantage of the converging communications
universe, which we at Multimedia plan to do. Doug's past
leadership roles in leading-edge media ventures and his broad
experience with marketing partnerships and other strategic
alliances make him ideally suited to be president and chief
operating officer of our company." 

Greenlaw added, "I'm delighted to join Multimedia, and share
Don's enthusiasm for the company's strong positioning. The
environment in which we will compete will consist of an ever-
increasing array of revolutionary technologies and complex
strategic alliances. Multimedia is healthy and ready to pursue
new opportunities that build on the synergies of its core
businesses and produce profitable growth."

Greenlaw founded the Veterans Leadership Program (VLP) in New
York City, and has served as its chairman since 1986. The VLP is
designed to take troubled veterans off the street, train them and
place them in career-track jobs. Known as one of the country's
most successful veterans' jobs programs, the VLP is in the
process of being expanded nationwide.

Multimedia, Inc. is a diversified media company headquartered in
Greenville, S.C., which publishes 11 daily and 49 non-daily
newspapers, owns and operates five television and five radio
stations, operates 125 cable franchises in five states, monitors
approximately 60,000 security alarm subscribers and produces and
syndicates quality television programming, including Donahue, Sally
Jessy Raphael, Jerry Springer and Rush Limbaugh, The Television Show.
