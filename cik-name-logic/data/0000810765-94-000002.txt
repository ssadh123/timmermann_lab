approved the decision to change independent accountants.

(iv) In connection with its audits for the two most recent fiscal
years and through February 16, 1994, there have been no
disagreements with Coopers & Lybrand on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement

disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of Coopers
