Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
Crestar Financial Corporation And Subsidiaries

(1) General
The consolidated financial statements conform to generally accepted accounting
principles and to general practices within the banking industry. The
accompanying interim statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements, including adjustments related to completed
acquisitions, have been included. All adjustments are of a normal nature.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 1994 presentation. The notes included
herein should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial
statements included in the Corporation's 1993 Annual Report and Form 10-K and in
the Corporation's 1994 First Quarter and Second Quarter Form 10-Qs.

On September 16, 1994, Crestar acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation
(RTC) approximately $17 million in deposits related to two branches of Second
National Federal Savings Association, Salisbury, Maryland, located in Fairfax
and Woodbridge, Virginia. In connection with this acquisition, Crestar paid a
$112 thousand premium to the RTC.

</TABLE>
The Corporation made income tax payments of $56,405,000 and $43,286,000 during
the first nine months of 1994 and 1993, respectively. At September 30, 1994, the
Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $99,430,000. There was no valuation
allowance relating to the tax asset. Crestar has sufficient taxable income in
the available carryback periods and future taxable income from reversing taxable
differences to realize its deferred tax assets. Management believes, based on
the Corporation's history of generating significant earnings and expectations of
future earnings, that it is more likely than not that all recorded deferred tax
assets will be realized.

(12) Earnings Per Share
Average common and common equivalent shares used in the determination of
earnings per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30 were:

<TABLE>
In thousands Three Months Nine Months
1994 1993 1994 1993
<S> <C> <C> <C> <C>

Plus assumed conversion of debentures - 14 - 15
Other - 6 20 36
Fully diluted 38,063 38,174 37,953 37,480
</TABLE>

Primary earnings per share are computed by dividing net income applicable to
common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period, including average common equivalent shares attributable to dilutive
stock options. Fully diluted earnings per common share are computed using
average common shares, including the maximum dilutive effect of average common
equivalent shares, increased by the number of shares that would result from
assuming that the 5% convertible subordinated debentures were converted into
common stock at the beginning of the applicable period and using net income
increased by interest and amortization of debt issuance expense, net of tax
effect, relating to those debentures. Net income for 1993 is further reduced by
the dividends applicable to the Series B preferred stock. The following table
provides the net adjustment to net income:

</TABLE>
In the first nine months of 1994 and 1993, $113,000 and $2,000 of subordinated
debentures were converted into 12,210 and 216 shares of common stock,
respectively.

(14) Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, there are outstanding commitments and
contingent liabilities and other financial instruments that are not reflected in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These include commitments to
extend credit, standby letters of credit, interest rate caps, floors and
collars, interest rate swaps, and forward contracts. No material losses are
expected to result from these transactions.

Commercial lines of credit are established for a potential borrower as an
indication of the aggregate amount of outstanding loans that the banks are
willing to extend. Sometimes these lines of credit are supported by balances
left on deposit, investment securities, real estate or inventory. Loan advances
made under such lines usually do not extend beyond the borrower's fiscal year.
Such advances are normally given for working capital purposes and require
repayment within twelve months.

Formal long-term commitments are made under legal and binding agreements for
which the borrower pays a commitment fee. These agreements typically contain
clauses that permit cancellation of the commitment in the event of credit
deterioration of the borrower. Crestar's outstanding standby letters of credit
amounted to approximately $380.0 million at September 30, 1994 and $402.6
million at September 30, 1993. At September 30, 1994, approximately $23.9
million of these standby letters of credit were participated to other financial
institutions.

The Corporation services mortgage loans other than those included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and, in some cases, accepts a
recourse liability on the serviced loans. At September 30, 1994, Crestar
serviced a total of $849.4 million of loans for which it had accepted a recourse
liability. Of this amount, approximately $496.1 million was insured by agencies
of the Federal government or private insurance companies. In addition, at
September 30, 1994, Crestar had forward contracts totaling $331.9 million
outstanding as hedges of lending commitments.

As a financial institution, Crestar entails a degree of interest rate risk as a
provider of banking services to its customers. This risk can be managed through
derivative interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, caps and
floors. Changes in the fair value of such derivatives are generally offset by
changes in the implied fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.
As hedges against interest rate risk at September 30, 1994, Crestar was
participating in interest rate (fixed receive) swaps having a notional value of
$1.64 billion. Of these interest rate swaps, $1.48 billion were used to convert
certain variable rate commercial and real estate loans to fixed rates, and $150
million were used to convert variable rate securities to fixed rates. An
additional $10 million in interest rate swaps were used to convert specifically
identified time deposits to variable rates in order to lock in a spread on the
variable rate assets which they fund. Notional balances of $876.2 million of the
above swaps were indexed amortizing swaps, whose notional value amortizes more
slowly as rates rise. Unrealized gains and unrealized losses on interest rate
swap contracts utilized as hedges were $2.2 million and $63.8 million,
respectively, as of September 30, 1994.

Crestar also had a notional amount outstanding of $200 million of interest rate
floor agreements on September 30, 1994 to minimize interest rate risk associated
with variable rate assets. Unrealized gains on these floor agreements
approximated $58,000 as of September 30, 1994.

The notional amount of these over-the-counter traded interest rate swaps and
floors does not represent Crestar's credit exposure, which the Corporation
believes is a combination of current replacement cost plus an amount for
additional market movement. At September 30, 1994, such estimated credit
exposure was $33.5 million. Four counterparties constituted 30%, 18%, 13% and
10% of the estimated credit exposure at September 30, 1994; no other
counterparties represented 10% or more of the estimated credit exposure at
September 30, 1994.

The average expected maturity at September 30, 1994 was 1.6 years for interest
rate swaps and 0.3 years for interest rate floors used by Crestar as hedge
instruments. The average fixed rate for these swaps was 5.88%. The interest rate
floors used by Crestar as hedges against interest rate risk are tied to the
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The average strike rate at September 30,
1994 for these interest rate floors was 5.50%.

Crestar serves as a financial intermediary in interest rate swap, cap, floor and
collar agreements, and at September 30, 1994 had aggregate notional amounts
outstanding of $148.9 million in offsetting swap, $73.1 million in offsetting
cap, $57.6 million in offsetting floor, and $52.5 million in offsetting collar
agreements.

Certain litigation is pending against Crestar. Management, after reviewing this
litigation with legal counsel, is of the opinion that these matters, when
resolved, will not have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

(15) New Accounting Standards
Effective January 1, 1994, Crestar adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities." In accordance with SFAS 115, securities are classified as
either securities held to maturity, securities available for sale or trading
account securities. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost,
as the Corporation has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities
to maturity. Trading account securities are carried at fair value as they are
intended to be sold in the near term: trading securities are classified as money
market investments on the Corporation's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Securities
available for sale are carried at fair value and represent securities not
classified as held to maturity or as trading account securities.

With the adoption of SFAS 115, unrealized holding gains and losses on securities
available for sale are excluded from the Consolidated Statements of Income and
reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity. On
January 1, 1994, securities having an amortized cost of $2.932 billion, and a
fair value of $2.983 billion, were classified as securities available for sale.
The initial effect of adoption of SFAS 115 was an increase in shareholders'
equity of $32.2 million, which was the amount, net of tax, by which the fair
value of securities available for sale exceeded the amortized cost of such
securities on January 1, 1994.

At September 30, 1994, on an after-tax basis, the amortized cost of securities
available for sale exceeded the fair value of such securities by $30.8 million.
The net unrealized gain or loss of securities available for sale, which is
recorded as a component of shareholders' equity, will continue to be subject to
change in future periods due to fluctuations in market value, acquisition
activities, and sales, purchases, maturities and calls of securities classified
as available for sale.

In accordance with SFAS 115, the Corporation's consolidated financial statements
for periods prior to January 1, 1994 have not been retroactively changed to
conform to current securities classifications. Prior to January 1, 1994,
investment securities which management intended to sell as a part of its
asset/liability management strategy, or that may have been sold in response to
changes in interest rates, prepayment risk or other similar factors, were
classified as securities held for sale, and were stated at the lower of
aggregate amortized cost or market value. All other investment securities were
accounted for in a manner similar to securities held to maturity or trading
account securities.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112), "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," was adopted by Crestar on January 1,
1994. Under SFAS 112, benefits provided to inactive or former employees before
retirement are accrued during the period of active employment, rather than being
expensed as paid. For Crestar, such benefits consist principally of short-term
disability benefits. Adoption of SFAS 112 resulted in a pre-tax charge to
employee benefit expense of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 1994.
Postemployment benefits expense for periods prior to January 1, 1994 has not
been restated.
