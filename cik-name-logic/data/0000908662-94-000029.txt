Fleet Financial Group Offers To Buy
Remaining Public Shares Of Fleet Mortgage Group
For $20 Per share

Offer Contingent On Support By Public Shareholders

Providence, Rhode Island, December 28, 1994: Fleet 
Financial Group announced today that it has made a merger 
proposal to acquire all remaining outstanding shares not owned 
by Fleet of Fleet Mortgage Group for $20 per share in cash. 
Fleet Financial currently owns approximately 81% of Fleet 
Mortgage with the balance of the shares largely held by money 
managers and other financial institutions. The aggregate 
amount of the transaction would be approximately $190 million.

It is expected that the merger proposal will be considered 
at a meeting of Fleet Mortgage's Board of Directors to be held 
in the near future. Fleet Financial stated that it believes 
that the proposed transaction, which represents a substantial 
premium over recent market prices, is a fair and attractive 
transaction for Fleet Mortgage shareholders.

The Fleet Financial merger proposal is subject, among other 
things, to Fleet Mortgage Board approval, a majority of Fleet 
Mortgage's public shareholders indicating support for the 
transaction and other customary conditions for transactions of 
this nature.

Fleet believes the transaction is appropriate at this time 
because of recent regulatory and accounting changes, industry 
earnings and share price performance and volatility, and Fleet 
Financial's recent reengineering program. The acquisition of 
the shares is not expected to be dilutive to Fleet Financial's 
1995 earnings.

Fleet Financial Group is a $47-billion diversified 
financial services company listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE-FLT) with approximately 1,200 offices 
nationwide. Its lines of business include commercial and 
consumer banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, 
asset-based lending, equipment leasing, investment management, 
and student loan processing.
