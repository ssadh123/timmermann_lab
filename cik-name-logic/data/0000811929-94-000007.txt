FOR RELEASE: April 8, 1994 Contact: Bert Delano
412/394-2813

Pittsburgh, PA - Allegheny Ludlum Corporation announced today that the 

United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania had 

issued an order adverse to the Company in a case filed in 1989 by Allegheny

International, Inc. which is being pursued by Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. 

The case involves claims for reimbursement of various alleged insurance 

coverage costs and recovery of a refund received by Allegheny Ludlum with 

respect to a federal income tax overpayment. The order, which granted a 

motion for summary judgment filed by Sunbeam-Oster, would require Allegheny

Ludlum to pay approximately $8.0 million to Sunbeam-Oster. The award 

consists of the amount of the tax refund, the insurance cost claim and 

interest. 

A spokesman for Allegheny Ludlum expressed disbelief at the decision and 

stated that the Company will promptly appeal the ruling. The Company 

continues to believe that Sunbeam-Oster's

claims are without merit and will continue to defend the case vigorously. 

A successful appeal of the District Court's ruling would result in a 

judgment in favor of Allegheny Ludlum or the case proceeding to trial. 

The case arose out of the 1980 management-led buy out of Allegheny Ludlum 

from Allegheny International. Sunbeam-Oster is the successor to 

Allegheny International following Allegheny International's bankruptcy 

reorganization. Sunbeam-Oster has claimed that it was entitled to the tax 

refund and insurance reimbursement that is the subject of the litigation 

under the terms of the stock purchase agreement between Allegheny Ludlum 

and Allegheny International. Allegheny Ludlum maintains that all of the 

claims were extinguished as a result of the 1986 transaction in which 

Allegheny Ludlum redeemed Allegheny International's remaining interest in 

Allegheny Ludlum and Allegheny International released Allegheny Ludlum from

all claims related to the acquisition.

Allegheny Ludlum is a leading producer of a wide range of specialty 

materials including stainless steels, electrical steels and high technology

alloys. The Company, which reported sales of over $1 billion in 1993, is 

listed on the New York Stock Exchange (Symbol: ALS).
