On July 21, 1994, CRSS Inc. ("the Company") sold its design subsidiary, CRSS
Architects, Inc., to Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, Inc. ("HOK") of St. Louis,
Missouri. Total consideration amounted to $6.8 million, consisting of $4.8
million in cash and a $2.0 million sharing of future net cash distributions
from a major overseas project.

On July 29, 1994, the Company sold its engineering and construction management
operations, consisting primarily of CRSS Constructors, Inc. and certain assets
and liabilities of CRS Sirrine Engineers, Inc., to Jacobs Engineering Group
Inc. ("Jacobs"). Total consideration paid by Jacobs amounted to $33.5 million
in cash, representing a $14.0 million premium over the aggregate book value of
the businesses acquired. As part of the transaction, CRSS retained certain
assets and liabilities (representing net assets of approximately $10.9
million), the majority of which relate to specific engineering, procurement and
construction contracts which are substantially complete or in the later stages
of completion. Additionally, the Company has agreed to indemnify Jacobs
against certain legal claims arising from any acts, errors or omissions prior

PURCHASE AGREEMENT

PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of July 21, 1994 (this Agreement"), by and
among Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Purchaser"), CRSS Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CRSS") and CRSS Services,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Services").

R E C I T A L S

WHEREAS, CRSS is the owner of all the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of Services, and Services is the owner of all the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of CRSS Architects, Inc. ("Architects," and
such shares are the "Architects Shares," as described in Section 5.2 hereof);
and

WHEREAS, CRSS also is the owner of the CRSS Assets (as defined herein);
and

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to purchase from Services and CRSS, and
each of Services and CRSS desires to sell to the Purchaser, all of the
Architects Shares and the CRSS Assets, respectively.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements hereinafter set forth, and intending
to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

SALE OF ARCHITECTS SHARES AND CRSS ASSETS

1.1 Architects Shares and CRSS Assets. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (a) Services shall sell, transfer,
assign and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase, the
Architects Shares, and (b) CRSS shall sell, transfer, assign and deliver to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase and assume, respectively, the CRSS
Assets and the CRSS Obligations (as defined below). The CRSS Assets shall
consist only of those assets of CRSS listed on the attached Schedule 1.1. The
CRSS Obligations shall be only those duties, liabilities and obligations of
CRSS that are listed on the attached Schedule 1.1.

1.2 Purchase Price.

(a) The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Architects
Shares and the CRSS Assets shall be equal to the net
<PAGE> 9
equity reflected on the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet of Architects prepared
in accordance with Section 1.3 below. As of the date hereof, the parties
estimate the purchase price to be $4,752,000 (the "Estimated Purchase Price").
As provided in Section 1.3(c), the appropriate party will pay the difference
between the actual Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price upon
completion of the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet. As additional consideration
for the transactions contemplated hereby, CRSS shall retain up to an additional
$2,059,000 pursuant to Section 1.2(b).

(b) (i) On and after the date hereof, CRSS agrees to pay to
the Purchaser, promptly following receipt of any cash distributions
from the CRS/Sirrine + Metcalf & Eddy Joint Venture (the Peace Shield
Joint Venture") formed for the purpose of performing the Peace Shield
Contract (defined below), including any phasedown thereof, pursuant to
that certain Joint Venture Agreement between CRSS and Metcalf & Eddy,
Inc., dated February 27, 1984 (the Joint Venture Agreement"), two-
thirds (2/3) of, and after CRSS has retained Net Distributions
(defined below) of $2,059,000 all of, the excess (such excess being
hereinafter referred to as the Net Distributions") of (i) any cash
distributions to CRSS from the Peace Shield Joint Venture in respect
of periods after June 30, 1994, over (ii) all of CRSS' costs and
expenses, including employee costs and other general overhead
expenses, incurred by CRSS in connection with the performance after
June 30, 1994 of its obligations with respect to the Peace Shield
Joint Venture (the Peace Shield Expenses"), except to the extent that
such costs and expenses are previously reimbursed to CRSS by the Peace
Shield Joint Venture. For a period of twelve months after the final
payment to the Purchaser pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
Purchaser agrees to reimburse CRSS for its appropriate share (whether
two-thirds (2/3) or all) of any Peace Shield Expenses which are not
included in the calculation of Net Distributions as provided in the
preceding sentence and CRSS shall pay to the Purchaser its appropriate
share (whether two-thirds (2/3) or all) of any reimbursed Peace Shield
Expenses received by it. For the purpose of this Section 1.2(b)(i),
CRSS shall not treat any costs and expenses not reimbursed by the
Joint Venture as Peace Shield Expenses without the approval of the
Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Purchaser
does not approve CRSS' request for treatment of any such unreimbursed
costs and expenses as Peace Shield Expenses, CRSS shall be entitled to
establish a reserve for such costs and expenses and reduce Net
Distributions by the amount of such reserve until CRSS and Purchaser
agree on the treatment of such unreimbursed costs and expenses or
their proper treatment is finally determined in a final nonappealable
judgment. Attached hereto as Schedule 1.2(b)(i) is CRSS' internally
prepared projection (the "Projection") of the revenues and expenses
anticipated to be earned or incurred by the Peace Shield Joint Venture
from September 1993 through the completion of the Peace Shield

2
<PAGE> 10
Joint Venture's future performance obligations under the Peace Shield
Contract (as defined in the Joint Venture Agreement). The Projection
represents CRSS' current estimates of Peace Shield Joint Venture
revenues and expenses, but is subject to change as future
circumstances dictate. There are no assurances as to the actual
amount of any such future revenues or expenses.

(ii) Concurrent with each payment to the Purchaser pursuant
to Section 1.2(b)(i), the Purchaser agrees to pay to CRSS an
Additional Payment. Each "Additional Payment" shall equal the amount
of interest that would have accrued at an annual rate equal to the
prime rate of interest announced by Chemical Bank (as such rate may
fluctuate from time to time) plus 1.5%, since the later of June 30,
1994 or the date of the most recent payment of an Additional Payment
(the Last Payment Dat") on a deemed principal amount equal to
$2,059,000 minus one-third (1/3) of the Net Distributions which were
made on or before the Last Payment Date. The Additional Payment also
shall include any prior accrued but unpaid Additional Payments. The
Purchaser hereby expressly authorizes CRSS to withhold from any
payment it would otherwise make to the Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.2(b)(i) an amount equal to the Additional Payment. No Additional
Payments shall be payable after the final payment to the Purchaser
pursuant to the first sentence of Section 1.2(b)(i).

(iii) The Purchaser agrees to indemnify CRSS and its
Affiliates against, and to hold harmless CRSS and its Affiliates from,
all Losses (as defined in Article VII, but excluding Peace Shield
Expenses) to the extent relating to the performance after June 30,
1994 of CRSS' obligations with respect to the Peace Shield Joint
Venture, even if caused in whole or in part by the negligence (but not
the gross negligence or willful misconduct) of CRSS or any of its
Affiliates, employees or agents, including without limitation Losses
arising from any obligation to repay to the U.S. Government or any
other person or entity any amounts paid to the Peace Shield Joint
Venture in respect of periods after June 30, 1994. CRSS agrees to
indemnify the Purchaser and its Affiliates against, and to hold
harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates from, all Losses (as defined
in Article VII) to the extent relating to the performance on or before
June 30, 1994 of CRSS' obligations with respect to the Peace Shield
Joint Venture, including without limitation Losses arising from any
obligation to repay to the U.S. Government or any other person or
entity any amounts paid to the Peace Shield Joint Venture in respect
of periods on or before June 30, 1994. Such mutual indemnity
obligations shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7.5.

(iv) Subject to the provisions of this Section 1.2(b), CRSS
agrees to continue to manage the performance of its

3
<PAGE> 11
obligations with respect to the Peace Shield Joint Venture in a manner
substantially consistent with its past practices. Without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, CRSS agrees not to terminate without cause the employment of
Truitt Garrison, Rogers Patton or Phil Sykes, or to change materially
without cause Truitt Garrison's, Rogers Patton's or Phil Sykes'
respective responsibilities with respect to the Peace Shield Joint
Venture. CRSS shall permit the Purchaser and its representatives to
examine its books and records with respect to the Peace Shield Joint
Venture at reasonable times and on reasonable notice for the purposes
of confirming the performance by CRSS of its obligations under this
Section 1.2(b). The Purchaser may appoint a representative who shall
consult with CRSS at regularly scheduled monthly meetings with respect
to material actions or decisions relating to the Peace Shield Joint
Venture. In the event that the Purchaser has a material disagreement
with any material proposed action or decision of CRSS relating to the
Peace Shield Joint Venture, CRSS agrees to cause its president or
chief executive officer to confer with the president or chief
executive officer of the Purchaser (who shall promptly make himself
available for such conference) prior to taking any such action or
making any such decision.

(v) Effective as of the date hereof, the Architects
employees involved in the performance of CRSS' obligations under the
Peace Shield Joint Venture, each of whom is listed on Schedule
1.2(b)(v) hereto, shall cease to be employed by Architects and shall
become employees of CRSS.

1.3 June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet; Adjustment Amount.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing (as defined in
Section 2.1 hereof), but in any event within 45 days following the Closing,
CRSS shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a consolidated balance sheet
of Architects and the Architects Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994, prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with the presentations in the Balance Sheet as of March 31, 1994
attached hereto as part of Schedule 5.6(a), reflecting on a pro forma basis the
adjustments set forth on Schedule 1.3 hereto, including without limitation the
CRSS Assets and CRSS Obligations (the "June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet"). The
June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet shall be based on an Architects' consolidated
balance sheet dated as of June 30, 1994, audited by Ernst & Young at the sole
expense of CRSS, and before any pro forma adjustments. The Purchaser shall,
and shall cause Architects and the Architects Subsidiaries to, cooperate with
CRSS in the preparation of the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet.

(b) CRSS will request that Ernst & Young make available to the
Purchaser all of their work papers in connection with its audit of

4
<PAGE> 12
the June 30, 1994 balance sheet of Architects and the Architects Subsidiaries.
Within 30 days after it receives from CRSS the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet,
Purchaser shall notify CRSS if it disputes the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet
as so delivered, such notification to specifically identify the points of
disagreement (the "Disagreements"). Such Disagreements must relate to the pro
forma adjustments or whether the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet has been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on
a basis consistent with the presentations in the Balance Sheet. Upon receipt
of such notice, CRSS shall promptly consult with Purchaser with respect to the
Disagreements in an effort to resolve the Disagreements. If any such
Disagreements cannot be resolved by Purchaser and CRSS within 10 calendar days
after CRSS is notified of such Disagreements, the parties shall refer the
specific Disagreements to a mutually agreed partner in an independent public
accounting firm of recognized national standing (the "Arbiter"), as an
arbitrator to finally determine, as soon as practicable, and in any event
within 30 days after such reference, such Disagreements. The arbiter shall
apply the terms of this Section 1.3, and shall otherwise conduct the
arbitration under such procedures as the parties may agree or, failing such
agreement, such procedures as the Arbiter may determine. The fees and expenses
of the arbitration and the Arbiter incurred in connection with the arbitration
of the Disagreements shall be allocated between CRSS and the Purchaser by the
Arbiter as he deems appropriate based on the extent to which each such party
prevails on the arbitrated Disagreements; provided, that such fees and expenses
shall not include, so long as either party complies with the procedures of this
Section 1.3, the other party's outside counsel or accounting fees. All
determinations by the Arbiter shall be final, conclusive and binding with
respect to the Disagreement and the allocation of arbitration fees and
expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, including without
limitation Sections 5.6 and 5.22 and, to the extent Section 5.26 refers to
books of account, Section 5.26, this Section 1.3(b) constitutes the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser with respect to the pro forma adjustments set
forth in the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet and any Disagreements raised by
Purchaser with respect to the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet.

(c) In the event the final Purchase Price, based upon the net
equity reflected on the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet determined pursuant to
subsection (a) above or, if necessary, subsection (b) above, is different than
the Estimated Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall pay to CRSS (if the final
Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price), or CRSS shall pay
to the Purchaser (if the final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price) the amount of such difference (the "Adjustment Amount");
provided that, in no event shall the final Purchase Price be greater than the
net equity reflected on the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet plus the payments
to be retained by CRSS described in Section 1.2(b). In either event, the
Adjustment Amount shall bear interest at the prime rate as announced from time
to time by Chemical Bank. The Adjustment Amount, plus accrued interest from
the Closing Date

5
<PAGE> 13
through the date of payment, shall be paid within five (5) business days after
determination of the Adjustment Amount, in immediately available funds.

1.4 Retained Liabilities.

ARTICLE III

RELATED MATTERS

3.1 Certain Transactions At or Prior to Closing.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any outstanding
contract, commitment, subcontract, purchase order, real property lease,
equipment lease, information technology obligation or other agreement of CRSS
or any of its Affiliates which would otherwise have constituted a CRSS
Obligation or a CRSS Asset (all of the contracts, commitments, subcontracts,
purchase orders, real property leases, equipment leases, information technology
obligations or other agreements subject to this Section 3.1 (being collectively
referred to herein as the "Contracts" and singularly as a "Contract") which is
not permitted under applicable law or pursuant to its terms or is not permitted
without the consent of any other party to the Contract or which purports to
restrict a change in control of such party, if such assignment would constitute
a breach of, or cause a loss of contractual benefits under, any of the
Contracts. If a consent to assignment of any Contract is not obtained, (i)
with respect to Customer Contracts and Contracts related thereto, Section
3.1(e) hereof shall apply, (ii) with respect to other Contracts, CRSS and
Architects will cooperate in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide to
Architects the economic consequences under such Contracts to the extent CRSS or
any of its Affiliates incurs such consequences, and (iii) CRSS shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts following the Closing to obtain such consents
if requested by Purchaser. In any event, whether the Contracts are assigned to
Architects or other arrangements are entered into with respect thereto in
accordance with this Section 3.1(a), Architects shall be solely responsible for
the performance of all such contracts after the Closing Date and shall assume
and discharge all obligations of CRSS and its Affiliates thereunder pursuant to
an assignment, assumption and indemnity agreement reasonably acceptable to the
parties hereto.

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date CRSS and Architects will
forgive any and all intercompany indebtedness between CRSS and Architects
existing at June 30, 1994. For federal income tax purposes such forgiveness
shall be treated as a contribution to the capital of Architects or a
distribution by Architects, as the case may be. The results of forgiving such
intercompany obligations will be reflected in Architects' shareholder's equity
for purposes of preparing the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet. Indebtedness
between CRSS and Architects arising from July 1994 transactions shall be

9
<PAGE> 17
paid in full by CRSS or Architects, as applicable, on or before August 15,
1994.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, (i) CRSS will transfer to
Architects, and Architects will employ the CRSS employees listed on Schedule
3.1 hereof, (together with the other employees of Architects and the Architects
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date other than the employees listed on Schedule
1.2(b)(v), the "Transferring Employees"), (ii) CRSS shall transfer to Purchaser
all trust funds, reserve accounts and other assets, if any, in or related to
the Plans and allocable to the employees of Architects or any Architects
Subsidiary, but only to the extent Purchaser, Architects, or any Architects
Subsidiary will have continuing liabilities with respect to the Plans after the
Closing Date to which such trust funds, reserve accounts, or other assets
relate, and (iii) CRSS will retain responsibility for any and all severance
obligations to Transferring Employees which arise before the Closing Date or
which arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, CRSS is
retaining, without the payment of any consideration, the following rights,
assets and claims (collectively the "Retained Assets"):

(i) all of Architects' and the Architects Subsidiaries'
right, title and interest in and to any and all receivables from King
Saud University and any receivables otherwise relating to or arising
from services performed in connection with the HOK + 4 Consortium, as
well as any collections or other proceeds thereof received after March
31, 1994, all of which receivables were written off prior to June 30,
1988, and will not be reflected on the June 30 Pro Forma Balance
Sheet.

(ii) all claims listed on Schedule 5.9;

(iii) any claims, including counterclaims, cross-claims and
claims for contribution or indemnity, relating to the claims listed on
Schedule 5.9;

(iv) any claims, including counterclaims, cross-claims and
claims for contribution or indemnity, relating to any matters,
including Project Claims (as defined herein), with respect to which
CRSS is required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Party (as
defined herein), regardless as to whether those matters are asserted
against CRSS or Services or any of their Affiliates by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates pursuant to Article VII or by a third party.

The Purchaser will reasonably cooperate, and cause Architects and each
Architects Subsidiary to reasonably cooperate, with CRSS in realizing the
benefit of the Retained Assets, and will, as reasonably necessary, cooperate
with CRSS in asserting any claims included in the Retained Assets in the name
of Architects or any

10
<PAGE> 18
Architects Subsidiary, as applicable. The Purchaser will cause any amounts
recovered by the Purchaser, Architects or any Architects Subsidiary with
respect to such claims to be paid promptly to CRSS. CRSS shall compensate
Purchaser at the Reimbursement Rate (as defined in Section 6.5 hereof) for the
personnel of Purchaser that provide any such assistance. CRSS shall consult
with the Purchaser prior to the assertion of any such claims that CRSS may wish
to assert against any person or entity to whom CRSS or its Affiliates provided
architectural or design services.

(e) With respect to Customer Contracts that require consent to
assignment in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and for which consents have not yet been obtained, CRSS and the Purchaser agree
that until such consents are obtained:

(i) The Purchaser will be deemed to have subcontracted
the remaining work, and the satisfaction of all the obligations, with
respect to such Customer Contracts, and any contracts related thereto
that require assignment in connection with this transaction but for
which consents have not been obtained (the "Related Contracts"). Such
Customer Contracts and Related Contracts shall be performed in the
name of the Affiliate of CRSS that is a party thereto (the "Corporate
Party") at the expense of and under the direction and by the employees
of the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall receive all benefits and
shall satisfy all obligations remaining under such Customer Contracts
and Related Contracts as if such Contracts were initially in the name
of Purchaser.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Purchaser, with respect to such Customer Contracts and Related
Contracts, shall satisfy and complete all related and incidental
project requirements, obligations, costs, expenses and expenditures
(including but not limited to the payment of costs of subcontractors,
sub-consultants, services or supplies of subcontractors and
sub-consultants, and the like; and all other costs required directly
or indirectly, chargeable or not, to complete such Contracts)
regardless of the status of such work on and status of such Customer

Purchaser). The favorable determination letter was received after full and
accurate disclosure of all material facts to the appropriate government
agencies. Neither CRSS, Services, Architects, any Architects Subsidiary nor
any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) that together with CRSS,
Architects or any Architects Subsidiary would have been deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA has subsequently
contributed, or was required to contribute, to any defined benefit plan or

Plans has engaged in a transaction in connection with which Architects or any

of ERISA or any civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or
any tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code and there has not

periods from the first day of the current plan year to the Closing Date).

21
<PAGE> 29
(h) All insurance premiums (including premiums, if any, to the
PBGC) have been paid in full, subject only to normal retrospective adjustments
in the ordinary course, with regard to the Plans for policy years or other
applicable policy periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

(i) Each of the Plans and their attendant trust, if any, or other
funding medium has been operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms, ERISA, the Code and any other applicable law
(including but not limited to all filing and reporting requirements such as
Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports and Summary Plan Descriptions)
and neither CRSS, Services, Architects, nor any Architects Subsidiary has any
direct or indirect liability with respect to such Plans or trusts under ERISA,
the Code or any other applicable law.

(j) Each of the Plans which is intended to be "qualified" within
the meaning of Section 401(a) or Section 501(c)(9) of the Code is so qualified
and has been so determined by the Internal Revenue Service to qualify, and
nothing has since occurred to cause the loss of the Plan's qualification.

(k) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.13(k) hereto, no Plan
provides benefits, including without limitation death or medical benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to current or former employees of
Architects or any Architects Subsidiary beyond their retirement or other
termination of service (other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law,
(ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any Plan, (iii) deferred
compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of Architects or any
Architects Subsidiary, or (iv) benefits the costs of which are borne by the
current or former employee (or his beneficiary).

(l) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.13(l) hereto, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i)
accelerate the vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due, any current
or former employee or officer of Architects or any Architects Subsidiary, (ii)
result in any prohibited transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code for which a class exemption is not available unless an
individual exemption has been obtained, or (iii) entitle any current or former
officer or employee of Architects or any Architects Subsidiary to amounts
payable under the Plans which will fail to be deductible for federal income tax
purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code.

(m) There are no pending, threatened or anticipated lawsuits
against Architects or any Architects Subsidiary by or on behalf of any of the
Plans, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan or by any
other party with respect to such Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).

22
<PAGE> 30

defined in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Code on or before the Closing Date, CRSS
retains all liabilities, obligations and duties for any continuation coverage
required under COBRA including COBRA liabilities, if any, arising as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(o) CRSS will retain responsibility for any and all severance
obligations to Transferring Employees which arise before the Closing Date or

5.14 Labor Difficulties.

CRSS and Services (in connection with the Architects Business), and
Architects and all Architects Subsidiaries (i) are in compliance with all
applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, discrimination,
terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours and occupational safety
and health laws, and (ii) are not engaged in any unfair labor practice as
defined by the National Labor Relations Act or any similar state or foreign
agency. There is no unfair labor practice complaint against CRSS or Services
(in connection with the Architects Business), or Architects or any Architects
Subsidiary pending before the National Labor Relations Board. There is no
labor strike or lockout actually pending or, to the knowledge of CRSS,
threatened against or affecting Architects or any Architects Subsidiary. Except
as set forth in Schedule 5.14, none of the employees of Architects or any
Architects Subsidiary is represented by any labor organization and CRSS does
not have any knowledge of any current union organizing activities among such
employees. No grievance nor any arbitration proceeding arising out of or under
collective bargaining agreements is pending. No collective bargaining agreement
which is binding on Architects or any Architects Subsidiary restricts any of
them from relocating or closing any of their operations and, except as set
forth in Schedule 5.14, neither Architects nor any Architects Subsidiary is a
party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or similar agreement
with any labor organization or employee organization applicable to such
employees of Architects or any Architects Subsidiary. Neither Architects nor
any Architects Subsidiary has experienced any strike of their employees during
the last ten (10) years. There are no charges pending before the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or any other agency responsible for the
prevention of unlawful employment practices. CRSS has not received notice of
the intent of any federal, state, local or foreign agency responsible for the
enforcement of labor and employment laws to conduct an investigation with
respect to or relating to Architects or any Architects Subsidiary, and, to the
knowledge of CRSS, no such investigation is in progress. Since the enactment of
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act"), neither
CRSS, Services, Architects nor any Architects Subsidiary has effectuated (i) a
"plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment
or one or more facilities or

23
<PAGE> 31
operating units within any site of employment; or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or facility of CRSS,
Services, Architects or any Architects Subsidiary in connection with the
Architects Business except in compliance with the WARN Act; nor has CRSS,

information and to have access to and consult any person which or who may be
relevant in connection with the conduct of their respective businesses, and
Purchaser and CRSS will reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with
preparation of the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet, financial and accounting
reporting requirements, litigation, Completed Contracts, employee benefit plan
and ERISA matters and requirements of applicable securities laws. Other than
with respect to minimal routine assistance, for which there will be no charge,
the party requesting assistance shall compensate the other party (i) with
respect to the first twenty hours of service provided by the other party's
personnel on a particular project in response to such request, at the hourly
rate of 135% of the hourly wage or prorated hourly salary, as applicable, of
such personnel (such rate being the "DPE"), and (ii) with respect to any
additional hours, at the hourly rate of two times the DPE, and in each case
shall reimburse such other party for other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(such compensation rates, together with such expense reimbursement requirement,
is the "Reimbursement Rate"); provided that this shall constitute the sole
right such assisting party has to reimbursement for expenses incurred in
providing such assistance. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section
shall be held in strict confidence and shall be used solely in connection with
the purpose for which it was requested.

6.6 Obligation to Replace Guarantees.

As promptly as practicable after CRSS' request, the Purchaser shall
use its best efforts to replace CRSS and its Affiliates on any specified
guarantees of any obligations of Architects or the Architects Subsidiaries
provided by CRSS or its Affiliates in the ordinary course of business.
Regardless of whether the Purchaser obtains any replacement guarantees, the
Purchaser shall indemnify CRSS and its Affiliates for any Losses (as defined
herein) arising from such existing guarantees to the extent the Purchaser has
the obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Article
VII hereof with respect to the underlying obligation.

6.7 Medical Benefits.

CRSS will continue to provide medical benefits pursuant to its
Voluntary Employee Benefits Association (the VEBA") to the Transferring
Employees from the Closing Date until July 31, 1994 (the "Benefit Gap Period").
After July 31, 1994, the Purchaser will provide medical benefits to the
Transferring Employees pursuant to its then existing medical benefit plans, and
on and after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall provide the benefits of its
stop loss medical insurance coverage to the Transferring Employees. The
Purchaser agrees that CRSS may retain the premiums paid by such Transferring
Employees through July 31, 1994. The Purchaser will indemnify and hold
harmless CRSS and its Affiliates against any Losses (as defined in Article VII)
incurred by CRSS and its Affiliates in complying with this Section 6.7 to the
extent those Losses exceed $150,000 per insured for claims in the Benefit Gap
Period.

6.8 License of Problem-Seeking Service Mark and Methodology.

At the Closing, Architects will enter into a license agreement with
CRSS Constructors, Inc. (Constructors"), and CRSS International, Inc.
("International") in the form attached hereto as Schedule 6.8, permitting
Constructors and International to use the Problem-Seeking Service Mark and
methodology in the conduct of their businesses, but not to assign or license
any rights to such Service Mark or methodology to any third party (the
"Problem-Seeking License").

6.9 Written-Off Receivables.

Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including Architects
and any Architects Subsidiary) will engage in any collection efforts with
respect to any receivable of the Architects Business that has been completely
written off prior to June 30, 1994 without the prior written consent of CRSS.
However, the Purchaser or the applicable Affiliate of the Purchaser shall be
entitled to retain any amounts received with respect to such receivables to the
extent such amounts are obtained without engaging in any such collection
efforts.

<PAGE> 45
6.10 Further Assurances.

Each of the parties hereto will, upon the request of the other party,
from time to time after the Closing, execute and deliver, and use its
reasonable efforts to cause other persons to execute and deliver, to such other
party all such further documents and instruments, and will do or use its
reasonable efforts to cause to be done such other acts, as such other party may
reasonably request more completely to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE VII

INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS

7.1 Survival of Representations; Time Limitations.

All representations and warranties made by any party to this Agreement
or pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing hereunder and any investigation at
any time made by or on behalf of any party hereto for a period of twenty-one
months after the Closing Date. An Indemnifying Party (as defined in Section
7.5) shall have no liability under this Article arising from a breach of a
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement unless notice of a claim
for indemnity shall have been given within twenty- one months after the Closing
Date.

7.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article VII, CRSS
and Services jointly and severally hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser and any Affiliate thereof, and the directors, officers,
employees, agents, contractors, successors and assigns of each of them (such
party or parties being indemnified are referred to herein as the "Purchaser
Indemnified Party"), at any time after consummation of the Closing, from and
against all demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including without limitation,
interest, penalties, costs of preparation and investigation and the reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other professional advisers
(collectively, "Losses"), asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
incurred by the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting
from any Retained Liabilities, a breach by Services or CRSS of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, any claim arising out
of the performance of, or a failure to perform, the obligations pursuant to the
CRSS Obligations (other than as provided in Section 7.2(c)) arising on or prior
to the Closing Date on the part of CRSS, or any of its Affiliates, including
Architects or any Architects Subsidiary, or the violation of any covenant or
agreement of Services or CRSS contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement,
which in either case has not been

38
<PAGE> 46
waived in writing by Purchaser, or any actual or threatened action or
proceeding in connection therewith; provided that neither Services nor CRSS
shall be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party to the extent
such Loss is reflected in the June 30 Pro Forma Balance Sheet.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article VII, the
Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless CRSS and any
Affiliate thereof, and the directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors,
successors and assigns of each of them (such party or parties being indemnified
are referred to herein as the "Seller Indemnified Party"), at any time after
consummation of the Closing, from and against all Losses asserted against,
resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party,
directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from (i) a breach by the
Purchaser of any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, or
the violation of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement, which in either case has not been waived in
writing by CRSS, or any actual or threatened action or proceeding in connection
therewith; (ii) the performance of, or a failure to perform, the obligations
pursuant to the CRSS Obligations from and after the Closing Date on the part of
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof; and (iii) the conduct of the Architects
Business after the Closing Date.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Project Claims" include any
and all Losses arising from demands, claims, actions or causes of action
asserted by a Project Claimant (as defined below) relating to project contracts
with customers for architectural services of Architects or any Architects
Subsidiary, or, to the extent such contracts are included as CRSS Assets or
CRSS Obligations (and whether or not any required approval or consent to an
assignment of any CRSS Asset or CRSS Obligation is obtained), CRSS or its
Affiliates ("Customer Contracts"). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Project Claims shall include Losses arising from demands, claims,
actions or causes of action asserted by customers, or by subcontractors (e.g.,
consultants) or others (but excluding Purchaser or its Affiliates to the extent
any of them has directly or indirectly succeeded hereunder to the contractual
rights and obligations of CRSS or its Affiliates) providing goods or services
in connection with the performance of Customer Contracts (collectively,
"Project Claimants"), whether or not any required approval or consent to an
assignment of any contract with any such Project Claimant is obtained,
including without limitation claims relating to back charges and warranties.
CRSS and Services hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Party from and against all Project
Claims relating to Customer Contracts that are completed on or prior to June
30, 1994 and Project Claims disclosed on Schedule 5.9 hereto. Subject to the
following sentence, the Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Party from and against all Project Claims that
relate to Customer Contracts that are not completed prior to June 30, 1994 as
listed

39
<PAGE> 47
in Schedule 7.2(c)(i) hereto, other than those Project Claims disclosed on
Schedule 5.9 hereto. With respect to Customer Contracts listed on Schedule
7.2(c)(ii) hereto, (i) CRSS and Services jointly and severally agree to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Party from and
against all Project Claims that relate to such Customer Contracts, but only to
the extent that the actions of CRSS, Architects or any Architects Subsidiary on
or prior to June 30, 1994 are shown to be the proximate cause of such Project
Claims; provided, however, if the Purchaser becomes aware of any such Project
Claim or any facts that would in the ordinary course of events constitute the
basis for a Project Claim, then the Purchaser shall take reasonable action to
mitigate the Losses relating to such Project Claim or such facts as is in
accordance with good professional and business practice and, to the extent that
actions beyond good professional and business practice are necessary, the
Purchaser will give CRSS notice of such Project Claim or such facts and provide
CRSS and Services reasonable cooperation in reducing CRSS's and Services'
exposure with respect to such Project Claim or such facts; and (ii) the
Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Party from and against all Project Claims to the extent that the
actions of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after June 30, 1994, are
shown to be the proximate cause of such Project Claims. Notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, this Section 7.2(c) describes all of the
indemnification obligations under this Agreement with respect to Project
Claims, and specifically such indemnification obligations shall not be limited
or expanded by any representations, warranties or covenants herein, including
without limitation, the representations and warranties in Sections 5.9 and 5.12
hereof.

7.3 Remedies Exclusive.

The remedies provided herein shall be exclusive and shall preclude the
assertion by any party hereto of any other rights or the seeking of any other
remedies against the other party hereto; provided that this Section shall not
preclude either party from asserting that it was fraudulently induced by the
other party to enter into this Agreement; and provided that the right of
set-off described in Section 8.11 hereof shall apply to this Article VII.

7.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) With respect to Losses arising from inaccuracies in any of
CRSS's or Services' representations and warranties (other than with respect to
Retained Liabilities or its representations and warranties in Sections 5.1,
5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6(b) and 8.7 hereof), (i) neither CRSS nor Services shall
be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party unless the aggregate
of all amounts for which indemnity would otherwise be due to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party exceeds $225,000 (the "Minimum Amount"), in which case CRSS
and Services shall be responsible for the amount of all such indemnifiable
amounts, including those up to the Minimum

40
<PAGE> 48
Amount, and (ii) CRSS shall only be liable to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Party up to an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price.

(b) No indemnification shall be payable to the extent the
Indemnified Party (as defined in Section 7.5) is covered for such Loss by
insurance; provided, however, that indemnification shall be payable pursuant to
this Article VII to the extent of any deductible applicable to any such
insurance coverage or insurance coverage provided by CRSS Insurance Ltd.

7.5 Notice and Control of Litigation.

(a) In the event that Purchaser seeks indemnification on behalf of
a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or CRSS seeks indemnification on behalf of a
Seller Indemnified Party, such party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give prompt written notice to the other party (the "Indemnifying
Party") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the
amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted. The Indemnifying Party
shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than twenty days after the
Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.

(b) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other than an
Indemnified Party hereunder) ("Third Person"), the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnifying Party notice within ten (10) business days after the assertion
of such claim is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the right of a person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims
made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give
such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced thereby, including without limitation by prejudicing the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend, to obtain insurance coverage with
respect to, or otherwise to minimize the Indemnifying Party's liability with
respect to, such matter. CRSS and the Purchaser shall, upon the request of
either, reasonably and in good faith attempt to negotiate an agreement
reasonably satisfactory to both of them providing for the joint defense of the
Third-Person Claim (as defined below)("Joint-Defense Agreement"). The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party, to investigate, secure, contest, or settle the claim alleged by such
Third Person (a "Third-Person Claim"), provided that the Indemnifying Party has
unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing his or its
obligation to indemnify the persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect to
such Third-Person Claim (subject to Section 7.4 hereof); the Indemnified Party
may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such
Third-Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense. Unless and until
the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges his or its obligation to indemnify, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its

41
<PAGE> 49
option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the
Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the costs of defense. The failure of
the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Person Claim within twenty (20)
days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an election not to defend the same.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge his or its obligation to
indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third-Person Claim, (a) the
Indemnified Party may defend against such claim, in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, and (b) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not
control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense.
If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the
Indemnified Party defended such Third-Person Claim or the amount or nature of
any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by
clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the
defense and/or settlement of such Third-Person Claim constituted gross
negligence or wilful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each
other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such
Third-Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

ARTICLE TWO: CONVEYANCE, CONSIDERATION AND RELATED MATTERS

2.1 Agreement of Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, CRSS agrees to sell to Jacobs, and Jacobs agrees to
purchase from CRSS, the Business to be Acquired for a purchase price (the
"Purchase Price") equal to the Closing Date Net Asset Value of the Business to
be Acquired plus $14,000,000.00, payable in cash.

2.2 Determination of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be
determined in accordance with this Section 2.2.

(i) Not later than two business days prior to the Closing
Date, Jacobs and CRSS shall agree on a preliminary Net Asset Value of
the Business to be Acquired. This value (the "Preliminary Net Asset
Value") shall reflect the consolidated net assets of the Business to
be Acquired as of a recent date, and shall be based on the Business to
be Acquired as reflected in the Interim Date Pro Forma Consolidating
Balance Sheet, but shall be adjusted as

7
<PAGE> 14
reasonably agreed between the parties to take account of differences
between the Business to be Acquired and the businesses reflected in
the Interim Date Pro Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet.

(ii) (a) Following the Closing Date CRSS shall cause
to be delivered to Jacobs an audited consolidating balance
sheet of the Business to be Acquired as of the Closing Date
(the "Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet"), together
with the unqualified report thereon issued by Ernst & Young
certifying the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a basis consistent with the presentation of
Services' consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 1993.
Jacobs and CRSS shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the preparation of the Closing 
Date Consolidating Balance Sheet.

(b) Not later than 25 days after the Closing
Date, CRSS shall deliver to Jacobs a draft of the Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet (the "Draft Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet"). Thereupon, Jacobs shall have
the right during the succeeding 20 days (the "examination
period") to examine (at Jacobs' sole cost and expense)
said Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet. Jacobs
shall notify CRSS and Ernst & Young in writing, on or before
the last day of the examination period, of any good faith
objections to the Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance
Sheet, setting forth a reasonably specific description of such
objections and, if practicable, the dollar amount of each
objection (such objections are hereinafter referred to as
"Disputed Matters"). If Jacobs does not deliver such notice
within the examination period, the Draft Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet shall be deemed to have been
accepted by Jacobs, and Ernst & Young shall thereafter
promptly deliver to Jacobs the Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet, together with its unqualified report thereon.
During the examination period, CRSS shall notify Jacobs
immediately of any change to the Draft Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet. If CRSS presents any change,
additions or deletions to the Draft Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet, then the Examination Period shall end 20 days
from the date of such later presentation. During the
examination period, CRSS shall cooperate in assisting Jacobs
with its examination of the Draft Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet including, without limitation, providing Jacobs
with full and complete access to all relevant books and
records during regular business hours, as

8
<PAGE> 15
well as access to CRSS' independent auditors and, to the
extent permitted by such auditors, its working papers, as
Jacobs may reasonably require to complete its examination of
the Draft Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet.

(c) If Jacobs in good faith objects to the Draft
Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet in accordance with
Section 2.2(ii)(b) above, then CRSS, Jacobs and Ernst & Young
shall attempt to resolve the Disputed Matters within 20 days
of the receipt of notice of such matters by CRSS. If the
parties are unable to resolve the Disputed Matters within such
20 day period, Ernst & Young shall, after considering the
objections raised by Jacobs and the responses of CRSS,
promptly request CRSS to make changes, if any, to the Draft
Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet that Ernst & Young
deems necessary in order for the Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet to present fairly the financial condition of the
Business to be Acquired in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, and CRSS shall
complete the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet in
accordance with such requests and deliver it to Jacobs
together with the unqualified report issued thereon by Ernst &
Young. Such balance sheet shall be the "Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet" as such term is used in this
Agreement.

(iii) "Net Asset Value of the Business to be Acquired" as
of any particular date means the excess, if a positive number, or the
deficit, if a negative number, of total assets minus total liabilities
of the Business to be Acquired as of such date.

(iv) Neither the Preliminary Net Asset Value nor the
Closing Date Net Asset Value of the Business to be Acquired shall
reflect any tax-related asset or liability for federal income taxes,
or state or local income taxes reported on a consolidated basis for
CRSS and its Affiliates.

(v) "Change in Net Asset Value," which may be a positive
or negative number, means the Closing Date Net Asset Value of the
Business to be Acquired as determined from the Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet minus the Preliminary Net Asset Value of
the Business to be Acquired.

(vi) Within two days following the agreement of CRSS and
Jacobs as to the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet, or the
final determination with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.2(ii)(c), Jacobs and CRSS shall determine the Change in Net Asset
Value in accordance with Section 2.2(v). If the Change in Net Asset
Value is positive, then Jacobs shall pay CRSS such amount within five

9
<PAGE> 16
days of its determination; if the Change in Net Asset Value is
negative, then CRSS shall pay Jacobs such amount within five days of
its determination.

(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, including
without limitation Article Twelve and any representations and
warranties herein, this Section 2.2 constitutes the sole and exclusive
remedy of Jacobs with respect to the Closing Date Consolidating
Balance Sheet, the Interim Date Pro Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet
and the Audited Financial Statements (as defined in Section 3.4), and
any other financial or accounting records or statements relating to
the foregoing financial statements, except as to matters knowingly
misrepresented or willfully not disclosed to Ernst & Young by CRSS.

2.3 Closing. The Closing of the exchange contemplated hereby shall
take place on July 29, 1994 at 10:00 a.m., P.D.S.T. at the offices of Jacobs
in Pasadena, California or at such other time, date and place as shall be
mutually agreed upon by CRSS and Jacobs. For the purposes of accounting for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such transactions shall be deemed
to have closed at 11:59 p.m. on July 31, 1994 (the "Closing Date"). If the
Closing shall not have occurred by July 31, 1994, then either CRSS or Jacobs
shall have the right, pursuant to Section 16.2, to terminate and cancel this
Agreement in its entirety.

2.4 Sales, Transfer and Documentary Taxes, etc. CRSS shall pay all
federal, state and local sales, documentary and other transfer taxes, if any,
due as a result of the transfer of the assets to be conveyed to Jacobs in
accordance herewith and shall indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless Jacobs in
respect of the liability for payment of or failure to pay any such taxes or the
filing of or failure to file any reports required in connection therewith.

notice of (i) any pending or threatened audits or assessments
with respect to income Taxes of the Corporations, and (ii) any

income Taxes of Jacobs which may affect the income Tax
liabilities of the Corporations for taxable periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date. CRSS shall have the right to

Tax Affiliates) to increase the Tax Benefits or decrease the
Tax Detriments to which they would otherwise have been
entitled for any taxable year beginning on or after the
Closing Date, CRSS will notify Jacobs of such adjustment and
provide Jacobs with such information as may be necessary for

ARTICLE ELEVEN: OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES AFTER CLOSING

The provisions of this Article Eleven shall apply from and after the
Closing Date:

11.1 Adjustments for At Risk Contracts.

(i) Jacobs has designated certain contracts to which the
Corporations are party as "At Risk Contracts". The At Risk Contracts
are listed on Annex VI, which is attached hereto and hereby made a
part hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Section 11.1 shall provide the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties for any matter that affects Margin Improvement
or Margin Deterioration; to the extent that a claim of a third party
results in Liabilities that do not affect Margin Improvement or Margin
Deterioration, such Liabilities shall be subject to indemnification
under Article Twelve to the extent provided therein.

(ii) Jacobs and CRSS shall share the risk of any "Margin
Improvement" or "Margin Deterioration" in the At Risk Contracts as
hereinafter set forth.

(iii) For the purpose of this Section 11.1:

(a) "Margin Improvement" shall mean any increase
in the gross margin of a project at final completion over the
sum of the gross margin recognized for such project in the
Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet plus the Closing Date
Future Gross Margin for such project; and

(b) "Margin Deterioration" shall mean any
reduction in the gross margin (including negative gross
margin) of a project at final completion over the sum of the
gross margin recognized for such project in the Closing Date
Consolidating Balance Sheet plus the Closing Date Future Gross
Margin for such project.

(c) For purposes of this Section, gross

44
<PAGE> 51
margin shall be determined in a manner consistent with CRSS'
past practice.

(iv) The Margin Improvement and Margin Deterioration on
each At Risk Contract shall be added, or subtracted, as appropriate,
to obtain the Aggregate Margin Improvement or Deterioration, as the
case may be.

(v) (a) Jacobs shall bear the risk of the first
$1,000,000 of Aggregate Margin Deterioration; Jacobs and CRSS shall
each bear 50% of the Aggregate Margin Deterioration in excess of
$1,000,000 up to $4,000,000, and CRSS shall bear all of the risk of
any Aggregate Margin Deterioration in excess of $4,000,000.

(b) Jacobs shall receive the full benefit of the
first $1,000,000 of Aggregate Margin Improvement; Jacobs and
CRSS shall each receive 50% of the benefit of the Aggregate
Margin Improvement in excess of $1,000,000 up to $4,000,000,
and CRSS shall receive all of the benefit of Aggregate Margin
Improvement in excess of $4,000,000.

(vi) Jacobs and CRSS shall account to each other on each
anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to the Aggregate Margin
Improvement or Deterioration on all At Risk Contracts, and the Party
determined to owe the other party with respect thereto shall pay the
amount owed within 30 days thereafter.

(vii) In managing the At Risk Contracts after Closing,
Jacobs shall manage the At Risk Contracts in a good, workmanlike and
timely manner in accordance with the terms and conditions of such At
Risk Contracts, and in accordance with prudent practice and industry
standards. After the Closing, Jacobs shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep the project management and completion bonuses on each
At Risk Contract in place until completion, but Jacobs may, in its
reasonable discretion, change or alter any or all of such project
management if such changes or alterations are made in good faith and
would not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
the gross margin on the At Risk Contract.

(viii) Annex VI, which is attached hereto and hereby made a
part hereof, contains a schedule of the forecasts of future gross
margins on each of the At Risk Contracts as reflected on the Profit
Plan per the Project Planning System or the Project Briefing Cost
Summary Report (such report or plan being referred to as a "Profit
Plan") for each At Risk Contract as of June 30, 1994. Contemporaneous
with the delivery to Jacobs of the Closing Date Consolidating Balance
Sheet, CRSS shall deliver to

45
<PAGE> 52
Jacobs a schedule of the forecast of future gross margin on each of
the At Risk Contracts as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Future
Gross Margin"), which Closing Date Future Gross Margins shall be
prepared consistent with the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet.

(ix) Jacobs will provide CRSS on a quarterly basis a
report on the status of each At Risk Contract indicating the Margin
Improvement and Margin Deterioration, as well as the gross margin then
recognized for each At Risk Contract and the forecast of future gross
margin with respect to each At Risk Contract. CRSS and its
representatives may examine at their sole cost and expense Jacobs'
records with respect to the At Risk Contracts pursuant to Section 11.7
and may confer with the Project Manager assigned to such project at
any time, including without limitation if CRSS disputes Jacobs'
accounting for any At Risk Contract.

(x) The parties agree that if the AMD Contract referred
on Annex V is ultimately determined not to be guaranteed maximum price
contract as of the Closing Date, it will not be treated as an At Risk
Contract under this Agreement. Jacobs agrees that it will not enter
into any oral or written amendment, modification, restatement or other
evidence of the AMD Contract without the prior written consent of
CRSS.

11.2 Trade Names. After the Closing Date Jacobs shall have the
exclusive right, as between Jacobs and CRSS, to use the trade names and
logotypes listed on Annex VII hereto, which is attached hereto and hereby made
a part hereof, and neither CRSS nor any CRSS Subsidiary shall employ the same,
directly or indirectly, as a trade name, service mark, trademark or business or
corporate name and shall cause the CRSS Subsidiaries using the same, including
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Engineers, to change their
corporate and trade names to names not using such trade names and to cease
using such logotypes. After the Closing, and solely in connection with the
Business to be Acquired, as Jacobs may hereafter expand the same, Jacobs shall
have the non-exclusive right and license to use the CRSS logotype and service
mark consisting of the letters "CRSS" in a block in close proximity to the
Jacobs name or service mark, and shall have the right to use all existing
stationery, brochures or other papers bearing the CRSS service mark, subject to
the reasonable requirements of CRSS, until the earlier of July 31, 1995 or the
date on which supplies thereof are exhausted. CRSS expressly disclaims any
warranty that it has the right to grant exclusive rights to any of the
foregoing trade names, logotypes or service mark.

11.3 Confidential Information.

(i) CRSS shall not, and shall cause the CRSS

46
<PAGE> 53
Subsidiaries not to, divulge, communicate, or use to the detriment of
Jacobs or for the benefit of any other Person or Persons, or misuse in
any way, any confidential information or trade secrets of any of the
Corporations including personnel information, secret processes,
know-how, customer lists, receipts, formulas or other Intellectual
Property.

(ii) Jacobs shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, divulge, communicate, or use to the detriment of CRSS or its
Subsidiaries or for the benefit of any other Person or Persons, or
misuse in any way, any confidential information or trade secrets of
CRSS or its Subsidiaries not relating to the Business to be Acquired
that it shall have learned in the course of its investigation of the
Business to be Acquired, including personnel information, secret
processes, know-how, customer lists, receipts, formulas or other
Intellectual Property.

11.4 Performance of Certain Contracts After Closing.

(i) With respect to Contracts that cannot by their terms
be assigned or for which consent to assignment has not been obtained
or the performance of which requires Jacobs to obtain professional
licenses that will not be obtained for some time after the Closing,
Jacobs and the CRSS Companies agree that until such consents or
licenses are obtained or such contracts are completed:

(a) Such Contracts shall be performed in the name
of the Affiliate of CRSS that is a party thereto (the
"Corporate Party") at the expense of and under the direction,
and by the employees, of Jacobs.

(b) Jacobs shall on behalf of the Corporate Party
continue to conduct all dealings with the other contracting
parties in the name of the Corporate Party, shall issue all
billings in the name of the Corporate Party and shall collect
all payments.

(c) Jacobs shall furnish all such personnel,
equipment and facilities as may be required to complete such
Contracts and shall reimburse the Corporate Party for its
reasonable expenses in carrying out its obligations thereunder
and shall indemnify the Corporate Party with respect thereto
in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 12.2.

(d) Each party shall account to the other party
with respect to such contracts promptly on an ongoing basis
during the performance of the contract.

(e) This Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any such Contracts, and such Contracts
shall not be assigned to Jacobs until all such consents and/or
licenses are obtained.

47
<PAGE> 54
(f) Amendments of, or expansion of services
relating to, any of such Contracts on or after the date hereof
will be entered into by, and be the total responsibility of,
Jacobs.

(g) CRSS and Jacobs shall execute any and all
additional documents and take additional measures reasonably
required by each other further to effectuate the foregoing.

(ii) For any work that needs to be performed on any
Completed Contract after the Closing Date, Jacobs shall provide to
CRSS the necessary resources for CRSS to perform such work in
accordance with Annex VI (Services Agreement) attached hereto.

11.5 Hiring of Employees of the Corporations.

(i) Effective immediately after Closing all persons who
are employees of the Asset Corporations at the time of Closing (other
than Steve Williams) shall be deemed to have been terminated by CRSS
and its Subsidiaries. Effective immediately after Closing all persons
who are employed by an Asset Corporation (other than Steve Williams)
shall be hired by Jacobs or a subsidiary of Jacobs, and Jacobs shall
be deemed to have hired the employees of the Stock Corporations. To
the extent permitted under all benefit plans and policies of Jacobs,
any eligibility waiting periods imposed by such plans and policies
shall be deemed to have been waived, and such employees shall receive
credit for their service with CRSS and the CRSS Subsidiaries by which
they were employed for the purpose of determining any participation
and/or vesting rights under such plans and policies including any
severance and vacation plans.

(ii) For a period of two years following Closing neither
CRSS nor any of its Affiliates shall directly or indirectly solicit
any former employee of a Corporation who is an employee of Jacobs to
terminate his or her employment with Jacobs.

11.6 Certified Financial Statements of the Corporations. CRSS
shall, at the sole cost and expense of Jacobs, deliver to Jacobs within 45 days
after Closing balance sheets of the Business to be Acquired at June 30, 1994
and 1993, together with the related statements of income, cash flows and
shareholders' equity of the Business to be Acquired for each of the two fiscal

48
<PAGE> 55
11.7 Maintenance of Books and Records. CRSS and the CRSS
Subsidiaries (and their respective successors and assigns) and Jacobs and its
Affiliates shall preserve until the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date all
records possessed or to be possessed by such party relating to the Business to
be Acquired, the Corporations, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Assumed Contracts and the Continuing Contracts. After the
Closing Date, where there is a legitimate purpose, such party shall provide the
other parties with access, upon prior reasonable written request specifying the
need therefor, during regular business hours, to (i) the officers and employees
of such party and (ii) the books of account and records of such party, but, in
each case, only to the extent relating to the Business to be Acquired,
including the Assumed Contracts and the Continuing Contracts, and the other
parties and their representatives shall have the right to make copies of such
books and records; provided, however, that the foregoing right of access shall
not be exercisable in such a manner as to interfere unreasonably with the
normal operations and business of such party; and further, provided, that, as
to so much of such information as constitutes trade secrets or confidential
business information of such party, the requesting party and its officers,
directors and representatives will use due care to not disclose such
information except (i) as required by law, (ii) with the prior written consent
of such party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (iii) where
such information becomes available to the public generally, or becomes
generally known to competitors of such party, through sources other than the
requesting party, its affiliates or its officers, directors or representatives.
Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by a party if such party sends to
the other parties written notice of its intent to destroy records, specifying
with particularity the contents of the records to be destroyed. Such records
may then be destroyed after the 30th day after such notice is given unless
another party objects to the destruction in which case the party seeking to
destroy the records shall deliver such records to the objecting party.

11.8 Payments Received.

(i) CRSS and Jacobs each agree that after the Closing
each of them shall hold and will promptly transfer and deliver to the
other, from time to time as and when received, any cash, checks with
appropriate endorsements (using their best efforts not to convert such
checks into cash), or other property that they or their Subsidiaries
may receive on or after the Closing that properly belongs to the other
party, and will account to the other for all such receipts. From and
after the Closing, Jacobs shall have the right and authority to
endorse without recourse the name of the named payee on any check or
any other evidences of indebtedness received by Jacobs on account of
the business and the assets transferred to Jacobs hereunder.

49
<PAGE> 56

encumbrances other than those listed in Exhibit 3.13, to all of the properties,
assets, good will and business comprising the Business to be Acquired,
transferred and assigned to Jacobs under this Agreement, all of which documents
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Jacobs and its legal
counsel. Subsequent to the Closing Date CRSS shall and shall cause the CRSS
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts (not involving the payment
of consideration) to obtain such consents, subject to the obligations of the
Parties pursuant to Section 11.4 hereof, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate in order to vest in and confirm to Jacobs good, valid and
indefeasible title to, and the right to use, free of any liens or encumbrances,
except for liens and encumbrances described in Section 3.13, the properties,
assets, goodwill and business of the Corporations herein comprising the

within 30 days thereafter, Jacobs shall commence commercially

any guaranties of any Assumed Contracts, Continuing Contracts, Leases,
Personal Property Leases, and Ancillary Contracts (the "Existing

providing replacement bonds, letters of credit and guarantees in
Jacobs' own name.

50
<PAGE> 57

successors named as additional insureds, provided that the issuers of such
policies agree to such an endorsement and such endorsement can be obtained by
CRSS at no more than nominal additional cost. If the cost of such coverage of
Jacobs is more than a nominal amount, then Jacobs may elect to pay for such
coverage, in which event CRSS shall procure such coverage at Jacobs' cost. CRSS
shall promptly furnish Jacobs evidence of such coverage when it is obtained.

acts or omissions that shall have occurred prior to Closing.

ARTICLE TWELVE: INDEMNIFICATION

12.1 General Indemnification Obligation of CRSS. From and after the
Closing, CRSS shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Jacobs and its
Affiliates, successors and assigns (each of whom is referred to as an
"Indemnified Jacobs Party") against and in respect of:

(i) Any and all Liabilities, asserted by any Person other
than CRSS and its Affiliates or Jacobs and its Affiliates arising from
any acts, errors or omissions of CRSS or any of its Affiliates on or
before the Closing Date in connection with (a) the Completed Contracts
regardless of when performed, and (b) any portion of any of the
Assumed Contracts and the Continuing Contracts performed by CRSS or
any of its Affiliates prior to Closing (a "Third Party Claim"),
whether such Third Party Claim is made against a CRSS Company, Jacobs,
a Corporation, the Business to be Acquired or any Affiliate or
subsidiary of any of the foregoing; provided, however, that with
respect to any Assumed Contract or Continuing Contract the obligation
of CRSS shall apply only to the extent that the actions of CRSS or one
of its Affiliates on or before the Closing Date are shown to be the
proximate cause of such Third Party Claim. With respect to the Assumed
Contracts and the Continuing Contracts, if Jacobs becomes aware of any
Third Party Claim or any facts that would in the ordinary course of
events constitute the basis for a Third Party Claim, then Jacobs shall
take such reasonable action to mitigate such Third Party Claim as is
in accordance with good professional and business practice, and, to
the extent that actions beyond normal mitigation are necessary Jacobs
shall give CRSS notice of such Third Party Claim and provide CRSS
reasonable cooperation in reducing the exposure of CRSS to such Third
Party Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, this Section
12.1(i) describes all of the indemnification obligations of CRSS under
this Agreement with respect to Third Party Claims relating to Assumed
Contracts and Continuing Contracts and specifically such
indemnification obligations shall not be limited or expanded by any
representations, warranties or covenants herein.

(ii) Any and all Litigation listed in Exhibit 3.18;

53
<PAGE> 60
(iii) any and all Retained Liabilities;

(iv) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant on the part of CRSS under
this Agreement; and

(v) any claims of CRSS or any of its Affiliates against
any Corporation. 

In determining the total dollar amount of all claims for which the Indemnified
Jacobs Parties are entitled to receive reimbursement pursuant to this Section
12.1 there shall be excluded any claims of $100,000.00, or less, for which
Jacobs would otherwise be entitled to reimbursement, but this limit shall not
exceed a total of $500,000.00 for all such claims.

12.2 General Indemnification Obligation of Jacobs. From and after
the Closing, Jacobs shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless CRSS and the CRSS
Subsidiaries and their successors and assigns (an "Indemnified CRSS Party")
against and in respect of any and all Liabilities incurred or suffered by any
Indemnified CRSS Party that result from, relate to or arise out of:

(i) any and all Liabilities and obligations of the
Business to be Acquired other than the Retained Liabilities;

(ii) any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
non-fulfillment of any agreement or covenant on the part of Jacobs
under this Agreement;

(iii) any acts, errors or omissions of Jacobs or any
Affiliate or subsidiary of Jacobs after the Closing Date, whether made
against CRSS, Jacobs, the Business to be Acquired or any Affiliate or
subsidiary of any of the foregoing ; provided, however, that, with
regard to any Assumed Contract or Continuing Contract, the obligations
of Jacobs will apply only to the extent that the actions of Jacobs
after the Closing Date are shown to be the proximate cause of such
claims; and

(iv) any Liability under the Existing Bonds, Letters of
Credit and Guarantees to the extent Jacobs has the obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified CRSS Party pursuant to Section 12.2 hereof
with respect to the underlying obligation; and

(v) any claim of any Corporation against CRSS or any of
its Affiliates.

12.3 Method of Asserting Claims, Etc.

54
<PAGE> 61
(i) In the event that any claim or demand for which CRSS
would be liable to an Indemnified Jacobs Party hereunder is asserted
against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Jacobs Party by
a third party, the Indemnified Jacobs Party shall promptly notify CRSS
of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of such claim or demand
and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then
feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount
of such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice"). CRSS shall have ten
days from the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the
"Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Jacobs Party, (A) whether
or not it disputes its liability to the Indemnified Jacobs Party
hereunder with respect to such claim or demand and (B) notwithstanding
any such dispute, whether or not CRSS desires, at its sole cost and
expense, to defend the Indemnified Jacobs Party against such claim or
demand. If CRSS does not respond to such notice within the Notice
Period, then CRSS shall be deemed to have disputed its liability.

(ii) If CRSS disputes its liability with respect to such
claim or demand or the amount thereof (whether or not CRSS desires to
defend the Indemnified Jacobs Party against such claim or demand),
such claim or demand shall not be settled without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Jacobs Party which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(iii) In the event that CRSS notifies the Indemnified
Jacobs Parties within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Jacobs Party against such claim or demand, then, except as
hereinafter provided, CRSS shall have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings; provided, however, that
CRSS shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Jacobs Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
consent to the entry of any judgment against the Indemnified Jacobs
Party or enter into any settlement or compromise that does not
include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to the Indemnified Jacobs Party of a release, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Jacobs Party, as the case
may be, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. If
any Indemnified Jacobs Party desires to participate in, but not
control, any such defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost
and expense.

(iv) If any material claim for which CRSS has accepted the
duty of indemnifying an Indemnified Jacobs Party involves a Person
that is or was during the three years immediately preceding the
Closing Date a customer of the Business to be Acquired (a "Customer"),
then CRSS shall not, without first consulting with the Indemnified
Jacobs

55
<PAGE> 62
Party, institute any lawsuit or other legal proceeding against any such
Customer.

In addition, and without prejudice to the foregoing, CRSS
shall, in the case of claims by a Customer against CRSS or any of its
Affiliates, permit Jacobs to have the sole right to control the
defense or settlement of such claim (including the sole right to
settle or otherwise terminate the proceedings) in exchange for Jacobs'
agreement to indemnify CRSS and its Affiliates as to such claim in
such manner as CRSS may reasonably require. 

In case of a claim by CRSS or any of its Affiliates against a
Customer, CRSS shall assign such claim to Jacobs, if Jacobs so 
requests, in return for the payment by Jacobs to CRSS of the amount of
the claim as reasonably determined by CRSS.

(v) In the event an Indemnified Jacobs Party shall have a
claim against CRSS hereunder that does not involve a claim or demand
being asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third
party, the Indemnified Jacobs Party shall promptly send a Claim Notice
with respect to such claim to CRSS. The foregoing shall not serve to
create any Liability or obligation of CRSS to provide indemnity to an
Indemnified Jacob Party except as expressly provided in Section 12.1.

(vi) All claims for indemnification by an Indemnified CRSS
Party under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved under the
procedures set forth in this Section 12.3 by substituting in the
appropriate place "Indemnified CRSS Party" for "Indemnified Jacobs
Party" and variations thereof and "Jacobs" for "CRSS".

(vii) In addition to the notice requirements of Section
12.3(i), Jacobs shall use its best efforts to notify CRSS of any
circumstances from which a Third Party Claim may reasonably be
expected to arise with respect to which Jacobs puts its insurance
carrier on notice of such circumstances.

12.4 Compensation for Claims.

(i) Upon a final determination of liability under Section
12.3 hereof whether by agreement of the Parties or by a final judgment
of a court, with all possibilities of appeal having been exhausted,
the Party found liable shall pay to the party to whom indemnification
is awarded within ten days after such determination, the amount so
awarded.

(ii) Upon the payment in full of any claim, the entity
making payment shall be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified
Party against any Person with respect to the subject matter of such
claim.

12.5 No Waiver of Subrogation. Nothing herein shall be construed as
a waiver of any right of subrogation to which any

56
<PAGE> 63
insurance company may be entitled under any insurance policy maintained by
Jacobs or CRSS. Neither Jacobs nor CRSS shall be obligated to make any claim
against any insurance company should it elect not to do so. The indemnification
set forth in Section 12.1 and 12.2 above shall extend to cases of the
indemnitee's concurrent negligence.

12.6 Cooperation of the Parties. Each Party shall give the other
Party its full cooperation in defending all claims by third parties subject to
indemnification hereunder, including furnishing witnesses and documentary
evidence to the extent available.

12.7 Claims Against Former Corporation Employees. If Jacobs makes
any claim against CRSS or any of its Affiliates with respect to any matter or
occurrence arising prior to the Closing, then CRSS shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, make any claim against any former officer, director or
employee of any of the CRSS Companies who are employed by Jacobs or any
subsidiary of Jacobs following the Closing with respect to such claim of
Jacobs, notwithstanding that CRSS or any of its Affiliates may have placed
reliance upon any such person before entering into this Agreement, but this
Section shall not apply to claims arising from intentional acts or omissions of
such former officers, directors or employees or counterclaims against such
former officers, directors or employees in litigation brought by them.

12.8 Limitation on Indemnification. CRSS shall not be required to
indemnify the Jacobs Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent of the aggregate
contingency reserves as shown on the Closing Date Consolidating Balance Sheet
or, with respect to Assumed Contracts and Continuing Contracts, the contingency
reserves shown on their respective Profits Plans as of the Closing Date, which
Profit Plans shall be consistent with the Closing Date Consolidating Balance
Sheet, and to the extent of such reserves the Jacobs Indemnified Party shall be
deemed not to have suffered any indemnifiable loss.

12.9 Survival of Representations; Time Limitations. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.8, 3.15 and 3.16(i),
which shall survive until two years after the Closing Date, and except for the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.18 or 3.27, which shall
survive until four years after the Closing Date, all representations and
warranties made by any party to this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall survive
the Closing hereunder and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of
any party hereto for a period of twelve months after the Closing Date. CRSS and
Jacobs shall have no liability under this Article Twelve for misrepresentation
or breach of any representation or warranty unless notice of a claim for
indemnity shall have been given to it within the applicable survival period;
provided,

57
<PAGE> 64
however, that nothing in this Section shall limit the time during which either
party may bring action for indemnification under Sections 12.1 or 12.2, except
under Sections 12.1(iv) or 12.2(ii).

12.10 Attorneys' Fees. If any legal action or any arbitration or
other proceeding is brought by either party with respect to this Agreement, or
because of an alleged dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in
connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the court shall award
the successful or prevailing party in addition to any other relief to which it
or they may be entitled, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in
that action or proceeding including fees and costs incurred on appeal and in
collecting any judgment, as equitably determined by the court and the court
shall so provide in its judgment.

12.11 Remedies Exclusive. The remedies provided in this Agreement
shall be exclusive and shall preclude the assertion by any party hereto of any
other rights or the seeking of any other remedies against the other party
hereto; provided, that this Section shall not preclude either party from
asserting that it was fraudulently induced by the other party to enter into
this Agreement or from seeking injunctive relief.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN: COSTS

13.1 Brokers' Commissions. Neither Jacobs nor CRSS knows of any
Person who is entitled to claim a commission or finder's fee with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except that CRSS will be
obligated to Merrill Lynch Investment Banking Group for such fees. CRSS on the
one hand and Jacobs on the other hand each agree to indemnify and hold harmless
the other against any loss, liability, damage, cost, claim or expense incurred
by reason of any brokerage commission or finder's fee alleged to be payable
because of any act, omission or statement of the indemnifying party.
