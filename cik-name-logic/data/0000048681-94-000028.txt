</TABLE>
Effective December 31, 1993 the company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("FAS No. 115"). In
accordance with FAS No. 115, investment securities in both the
noninsurance and insurance operations are classified in three
separate categories: trading, available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity. Trading investments are bought and held principally
for the purpose of selling them in the near term and are carried
at fair value. Adjustments to the carrying value of trading
investments are included in current earnings. Investments which
the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at
amortized cost. Investments not classified as trading or held-
to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale. They are
intended to be invested for an indefinite period but may be sold
in response to events reasonably expected in the foreseeable
future. These investments are carried at fair value. Unrealized
holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are
recorded as adjustments to common shareholder's equity, net of
income taxes and, for certain investments of the insurance
operation, related unrealized deferred insurance policy
acquisition cost adjustments. Prior to the adoption of FAS No.
115, available-for-sale investments were carried at the lower of
aggregate amortized cost or market value, and any adjustments to
carrying value for the noninsurance operations were included in
earnings, while any adjustments to carrying value for the
insurance operations were included in shareholder's equity. Any
decline in the carrying values of available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity investments which are deemed to be other than temporary
are charged against current earnings.
