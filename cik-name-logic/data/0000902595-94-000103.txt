FHP INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA UNAUDITED
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

1. General

The historical and pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet of FHP International Corporation ("FHP" or "the
Company") reflects the Merger as though it occurred on March 31, 1994. 
The historical and pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of income of the Company reflect the Merger and the
September 1993 acquisition of Comprecare, Inc. by TakeCare, Inc.
("TakeCare") as though both transactions occurred on July 1, 1992. 
The Merger will be accounted for as a purchase transaction.

No effect has been given in the historical and pro forma
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for operating
and synergistic benefits that may be realized through the combination
of the entities, including any increased enrollment of Medicare
eligible persons in geographic areas principally served by TakeCare
(Northern California, Colorado, Illinois, and Ohio). Certain minor
reclassifications have been made to the TakeCare historical financial
statements to conform them to FHP's presentation.

TakeCare has agreed with FHP that if the expenses of TakeCare
incurred in connection with the Merger, including financial advisory
fees, accounting, legal and consulting fees, and costs in connection
with any litigation relating to the Merger, exceed $3 million, such
excess (the "Excess Expenses") will reduce pro rata the amount of cash
or shares of Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock to be
issued in the Merger upon conversion of each share of TakeCare Common
Stock. For purposes of these pro forma financial statements, the
Excess Expenses are assumed to be $8.0 million, resulting in a
reduction of the cash consideration to $27.38 from $28.00 or of the
Series B Preferred Stock from 1.12 shares to approximately 1.10 shares
for each share of TakeCare Common Stock.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share
of TakeCare common stock (estimated to be 12,912 shares for purposes
of these historical and pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements (pro forma financial statements)) will be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, the following
consideration (valued at an aggregate of $80.00 per share less the
estimated impact of the Excess Expenses of approximately $0.62 per
share for purposes of these pro forma financial statements):

(1) 1.6 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock (Series A Preferred Stock); plus

(2) 1.12 shares of Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock (Series B Preferred Stock), or at the specific election of the
holder, cash of $28.00 per share of TakeCare Common Stock; plus

(3) .48 of a share of FHP Common Stock, as provided in the
Merger Agreement since FHP's stock traded at less than an average of
$25 per share for 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third
trading day prior to the effective date of the Merger.

Holders of Series A Preferred Stock with stated value of $25 will
be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends of 5.0% per annum. 
Dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears when and if declared by
FHP's Board of Directors. On or after the fourth anniversary of the
Merger, FHP may, at its option, redeem all or part of the outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at fixed redemption prices per
share plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible at the option of
the holder into FHP Common Stock at any time commencing six months
after the Closing. The conversion price for the Series A Preferred
Stock is $31.00 per share.

Holders of Series B Preferred Stock with stated value of $25 will
be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends of not less than 5.0%
per annum or greater than 11.0% per annum. The actual dividend rate
will be determined quarterly based upon prevailing market rates as
provided in the Merger Agreement. Dividends will be payable quarterly
in arrears when and if declared by FHP's Board of Directors. 
Beginning nine months after June 17, 1994, FHP may, at its option,
redeem all or part of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, at $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
dividends.

2. Cash and Cash Equivalents

Pro forma adjustments to cash and cash equivalents consist of the
following:

Proceeds of long-term borrowings
(net of financing costs of $1,600) $310,490

Cash consideration paid in the Merger (353,531)

Repayment of TakeCare long-term
obligations, including current portion (37,500)

Payment of estimated costs of the Merger (11,459)

Payment of Excess Expenses of
TakeCare (see Note 1) (8,000)
_________

($100,000)
=========

The pro forma financial statements assume that the holders of
TakeCare Common Stock will elect to receive cash of $27.38 per share
as Merger Consideration in lieu of the Series B Preferred Stock. (See
Note 9 for summary pro forma financial information assuming holders of
TakeCare Common Stock elect to receive approximately 1.10 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock as Merger Consideration.)

The TakeCare long-term obligations are being retired immediately
after the Closing as required by TakeCare's existing debt agreement
upon a change in control of TakeCare.

3. Excess of Purchase Price Over Net Assets Acquired

Pro forma adjustments to the excess of purchase price over net
assets acquired consist of the following:

Resulting from the Merger $1,015,185
Elimination of previously recorded excess 
of purchase price over net assets acquired 
of TakeCare (net of accumulated amortization 
of $13,726) (223,047)
___________
$792,138
===========

Management has not completed an allocation of the purchase price
of TakeCare to the assets and liabilities that will be acquired. 
However, management believes that the amounts reflected on TakeCare's
historical consolidated balance sheet as tangible assets and
liabilities approximate the fair market values of such assets and
liabilities and accordingly, such assets have not been adjusted in the
accompanying pro forma financial statements.

4. Long-term Obligations 

Pro forma adjustments to long-term obligations consist of the
following:

____________ __________ ___________ _________ 

($1,309) $12,422 ($241) $10,206 
============ ========== =========== =========

The interest rate on the long-term obligations incurred to
finance the Merger is a floating rate based on the principal lender's
prime rate in the London Interbank market plus 0.6% which, based upon
current rates, would be approximately 5.1%. Each 1/4% increase in
such floating rate would decrease annual pro forma consolidated net
income by $398 and pro forma consolidated earnings per share
attributable to Common Stock by $0.01 per annum.

9. Earnings Per Share 

Earnings per share is based on the weighted average shares of
outstanding Common Stock and common stock equivalents during the
respective periods. The pro forma financial statements assume the
holders of TakeCare common stock will elect to receive cash in lieu of 
Series B Preferred Stock issued as of the effective date. The
inclusion of additional common shares assuming the conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive for the year
ended June 30, 1993 and the nine months ended March 31, 1994 for both
the primary and fully diluted pro forma earnings per share
computations. Accounting rules governing the computation of earnings
per share require that dividends on cumulative preferred stock,
whether declared or not, be deducted in the earnings per share
computation.

The shares used in the computation of primary earnings per share
were as follows:

Cash dividends on Series A

======= =======

The pro forma financial statements have been prepared assuming
that all Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding for the year ended
June 30, 1993 and the nine months ended March 31, 1994.

As stated above, the pro forma financial statements assume the
holders of TakeCare Common Stock will elect to receive cash in lieu of
the Series B Preferred Stock. Accordingly, earnings per share has
been calculated assuming that no shares of Series B Preferred Stock
will be issued. If all holders of TakeCare Common Stock were to elect
to receive Series B Preferred Stock rather than cash, the principal
changes to the historical and pro forma unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of income would be as follows, assuming an
interest rate equal to 93% of the thirty-year average yield published
by the Federal Reserve Board as provided for in the Merger Agreement
(approximately 6.9% for this pro forma calculation - see Note 1 for
further explanation of range of possible dividends):
