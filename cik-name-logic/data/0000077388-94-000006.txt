Utility Rate Proceedings

On December 16, 1994, the Company expects to file with the

Illinois Commerce Commission (Commission) proposed changes in

rates that are designed to increase annual revenues by about

$59.9 million, exclusive of additional charges for revenue taxes.

base of 10.03 percent, which reflects a 12.7 percent cost of

common equity.

The Company expects that the Commission, following its usual

practices, would not issue a decision regarding the Company's

rate increase request until November 1995. The Company cannot

predict the outcome of its rate increase request.
