Item 1. Changes in Control of Registrant.

(a) Change in Control. On May 31, 1994, a special meeting
(the "Special Meeting") of the holders of common units of limited
partner interests ("Common Units") of Valero Natural Gas
Partners, L.P. ("VNGP, L.P.") was held at the offices of Valero
Natural Gas Company ("VNGC"), the general partner of VNGP, L.P. 
At the Special Meeting, the holders of Common Units approved a
proposal providing for the merger (the "Merger") of VNGP, L.P.
with a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation
("VEC" and, collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, the
"Company"). The Merger was consummated on May 31, 1994, upon
satisfaction of all preconditions to the Merger and the filing of
a certificate of merger with the Office of the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware.

As a result of the Merger, VNGP, L.P. has become a wholly
owned subsidiary of VEC. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
Common Units held by persons other than the Company (the "Public
Unitholders") were converted into the right to receive cash in
the amount of $12.10 per Common Unit, while the Common Units
owned by subsidiaries of VEC have remained outstanding. Prior to
the Merger, approximately 52.5% of the outstanding Common Units
were held by the Public Unitholders, and approximately 47.5% of
the outstanding Common Units were held by the Company. As a
result of the Merger, all of the outstanding Common Units are
held by the Company. VNGC has made available against delivery of
Common Unit certificates and other proper documentation
approximately $117.5 million to the Public Unitholders as payment
of the cash consideration required in the Merger. A portion of
the proceeds from an underwritten public offering of VEC's $3.125
Convertible Preferred Stock, completed in March 1994, was
advanced from VEC to VNGC to fund the payment to the Public
Unitholders. 

(b) Certain Arrangements. VNGC is unaware of any
arrangement, including the pledge by any person of securities of
VNGP, L.P. or any of its parents, the operation of which may at a
subsequent date result in a change in control of VNGP, L.P.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(c) The following are filed as exhibits to this Current
Report:
2.1 Agreement of Merger, dated December 20, 1993, among Valero
Energy Corporation; Valero Natural Gas Partners, L.P.; Valero
