PRO FORMA COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following unaudited Pro Forma Combining Balance Sheet as of
September 30, 1994 and unaudited Pro Forma Combining Income Statements for the
nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993, and for the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, illustrate the effect of the proposed issuance of LDDS
Common Stock pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 1,
1994 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among LDDS, IDB Communications Group, Inc.
("IDB") and 123 Corp. ("Acquisition Subsidiary"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
LDDS, as if the proposed issuance had occurred at the beginning of the earliest
period presented.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Subsidiary would merge
with and into IDB in a transaction which would result in the survival of IDB as
a wholly-owned subsidiary of LDDS (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger,
each holder of IDB Common Stock will be entitled to receive a certain fraction
of a share of LDDS Common Stock based on an average closing trade price of
LDDS Common Stock. These pro forma financial statements have been prepared
assuming the LDDS Share Value to be equal to or greater than $22.00 resulting
in an exchange ratio of 0.450867 (the "Exchange Ratio"). No assurance can be
given as to the actual Exchange Ratio that will be utilized in the Merger. The
Merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.

The following unaudited Pro Forma Combining Balance Sheet as of
September 30, 1994 and the unaudited Pro Forma Combining Income Statements for
the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and for the year ended December 31,
1993 also illustrate the effect of LDDS's proposed acquisition of Williams
Telecommunications Group, Inc. ("WilTel") for $2.5 billion in cash (the "WilTel
Acquisition") and the proposed financing thereof. Pursuant to the terms of the
acquisition agreement, LDDS will acquire WilTel for cash payments of $2.5
billion, subject to adjustments. The WilTel Acquisition will be accounted for
as a purchase. Completion of the Merger is not a condition to the consummation
of the WilTel Acquisition.

These Pro Forma Combining Financial Statements should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements of LDDS and IDB and the
network services operations of WilTel, the LDDS Adjusted Historical Financial
Statements and the IDB Adjusted Historical Financial Statements which are set
forth elsewhere herein.

The Pro Forma Combining Financial Statements are presented for
comparative purposes only and are not intended to be indicative of actual
results had the transactions occurred as of the dates indicated above nor do
they purport to indicate results which may be attained in the future.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. The adjustments to the unaudited Pro Forma Combining Financial
Statements do not give effect to direct transaction costs or any
resulting restructuring costs associated with the consummation of the
Merger. All such costs are estimated to be $50.0 million, which amount
includes approximately $10.0 million of direct transaction costs. The
pro forma financial data do not give effect to any potential cost
savings and synergy's that could result from the Merger or the WilTel
Acquisition. The pro forma data are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results or financial position that would have occurred had
the Merger or the WilTel Acquisition been consummated at the dates
indicated, nor necessarily indicative of future operating results or
financial position.

2. These adjustments reflect the issuance of approximately 33.4 million
shares of LDDS Common Stock in accordance with the assumed Exchange
Ratio of 0.450867 shares of LDDS Common Stock for each share of IDB
Common Stock outstanding. The actual number of shares of LDDS Common
Stock to be issued, pursuant to the Merger, will be based on the
number of shares of IDB Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the consummation of the Merger and the actual Exchange Ratio, based on
the LDDS Share Value.

3. These adjustments represent the elimination of certain assets and
liabilities of WilTel that LDDS will not acquire as part of the WilTel
Acquisition as set forth in the acquisition agreement. The assets and
liabilities excluded include cash, tax asset and liability accounts
with affiliates, accounts payable to affiliates and amounts due from
affiliates, which consist of unsecured payables and receivables of
WilTel with Williams.

4. This adjustment reflects an increase to WilTel's working capital to
comply with the required working capital amounts as set forth in the
WilTel Acquisition agreement. The acquisition agreement provides that
upon the date of its acquisition by LDDS, WilTel will have a current
ratio equal to the ratio existing at December 31, 1993. At September
30, 1994, this requirement would have necessitated a $27.7 million
increase to WilTel's current assets.

5. This adjustment reflects the excess of cost over net tangible assets
acquired in the WilTel Acquisition. For purposes of allocating the
acquisition costs among the various assets acquired, LDDS has
tentatively considered the carrying value of the acquired assets to
approximate their fair value, with all of the excess of such
acquisition costs being attributed to goodwill. It is LDDS's
intention, subsequent to the acquisition, to more fully evaluate the
acquired assets and, as a result, the allocation of the acquisition
costs among the tangible and intangible assets acquired may change.

6. This adjustment reflects the capitalization of fees incurred to obtain
the new credit facilities (see Note 8).

7. This adjustment represents the replacement of the LDDS $123.0 million
Senior Notes with a portion of the new credit facilities (see Note 8).

8. This adjustment represents the incremental proceeds to be received
under the new credit facilities for the purpose of financing the
WilTel Acquisition and its related costs.

9. These adjustments represent the elimination of WilTel's shareholders'
investment accounts.

10. These columns represent the historical results of operations.

11. These adjustments eliminate the revenues and corresponding line costs
attributable to the intercompany traffic between LDDS and IDB.

12. These adjustments eliminate the revenues and corresponding line costs
attributable to the intercompany traffic between LDDS/IDB pro forma
combined operations and WilTel.

13. This adjustment reflects amortization over 40 years of the excess of
cost over net tangible assets acquired in the WilTel Acquisition (see
Note 5).

14. This adjustment reflects the amortization over 6 years of capitalized
fees incurred to obtain the new credit facilities (see Note 6).

15. These adjustments represent interest savings to LDDS, as it will not
acquire any of WilTel's debt in the WilTel Acquisition (see Note 3).

16. This adjustment represents the recognition of interest expense on the
additional borrowings of LDDS to fund the WilTel Acquisition and
related costs (see Note 8). The interest expense was calculated at an
assumed rate of interest of 6.7%. A change of 1/8% in the assumed rate
would affect interest expense by $2.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1994 and by $3.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 1993.

17. This adjustment reflects the interest savings resulting from the
replacement of LDDS' $123.0 million Senior Notes with the new credit
facilities (see Note 8).

18. These adjustments represent the tax effect of adjustments due to
inclusion of the acquired operations. The tax provisions were
calculated at a combined federal and state rate of 39% applied to
items impacting taxable income. However, for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994, the only item considered to have an impact upon
LDDS/IDB Pro Forma Combined taxable income was the $76.0 million
shareholder litigation settlement. Because of tax planning strategies,
LDDS management believes that presently the shareholder litigation
settlement is the only item

F-10
<PAGE> 14
contributing to IDB's results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994 for which the combined company of LDDS and IDB is
more likely than not to realize a tax benefit. After consummation of
the Merger, LDDS management will review tax planning strategies in
order to identify any additional net operating loss utilization
available to the combined company of LDDS and IDB.

19. Pro forma per share data are calculated using the pro forma net income
(loss) applicable to the common shareholders divided by the pro forma
weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding. The
pro forma weighted average common and common equivalent shares
outstanding includes the LDDS weighted average common and common
equivalent shares outstanding plus the Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the weighted common and common equivalent shares outstanding of IDB.
For periods of pro forma losses, common equivalent shares are not
considered in the calculation of pro forma per share data, as their
inclusion would be anti dilutive.

20. The LDDS Adjusted Historical Income Statement for the year ended
December 31, 1993 includes (1) the effect of LDDS' acquisition in
March 1993 of Dial-Net for cash payments of approximately $31.2
million and the issuance of 2.7 million shares of LDDS Common Stock
valued at approximately $42.9 million and (2) the effect of LDDS's
acquisition in September 1993 of MCC and Resurgens for cash payments
of approximately $150.0 million and the issuance of common and
preferred stock valued at approximately $1.1 billion. The LDDS
Adjusted Historical Income Statement assumes that the Prior Mergers
and the Dial-Net acquisition occurred at the beginning of the earliest
period presented. See "LDDS Adjusted Historical Financial Statements"
which are set forth elsewhere herein.

The IDB Adjusted Historical Income Statement for the year ended
December 31, 1993 includes the effect of IDB's acquisition in
September 1993 of TRT Communications, Inc. ("TRT") for cash payments
of $1.0 million and the issuance of 10.1 million shares of IDB Common
Stock valued at approximately $79.0 million. The IDB Adjusted
Historical Income Statement assumes that the TRT acquisition occurred
at the beginning of the earliest period presented. See "IDB Adjusted
Historical Income Statement" which is set forth elsewhere herein.

After consummation of the Merger, the financial statements of LDDS as
of and for the year ended December 31, 1993, will be restated to
reflect the combination of the financial position and results of
operations of LDDS and IDB. Such financial statements will report
revenues of $1.5 billion, net income available to common shareholders
of $112.6 million, primary earnings per share of $0.83 and fully
diluted earnings per share of $0.81.

LDDS ADJUSTED HISTORICAL INCOME STATEMENT

The following unaudited LDDS Adjusted Historical Income Statement for
the year ended December 31, 1993, illustrates the effect of LDDS's acquisition
in March 1993 of Dial-Net, Inc. ("Dial-Net") for cash payments of $31.2 million
and the issuance of 2.75 million shares of LDDS Common Stock valued at
approximately $42.9 million and the September 15, 1993, three-way merger
whereby (i) Metromedia Communications Corporation ("MCC") merged with and into
Resurgens Communications Group, Inc. ("Resurgens") and (ii) LDDS
Communications, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("LDDS-TN"), merged with and
into Resurgens (the "Prior Mergers") for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2
billion. The LDDS Adjusted Historical Income Statement assumes that the Prior
Mergers and the Dial-Net acquisition, all accounted for as purchase
transactions, occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

At the time of the Prior Mergers, the name of Resurgens, the legal
survivor, was changed to LDDS Communications, Inc. and the separate corporate
existence of LDDS-TN and MCC terminated. For accounting purposes, LDDS-TN is
the survivor because the former shareholders of LDDS-TN acquired the majority
ownership of LDDS.

Upon effectiveness of the Prior Mergers, each share of the outstanding
Class A Common Stock of LDDS-TN was converted into the right to receive 0.9595
shares of LDDS Common Stock. As a result of the consummation of the Prior
Mergers, Metromedia Company, the sole stockholder of MCC, received 2,758,620
shares of the LDDS Common Stock, 10,896,785 shares of LDDS Series 1 $2.25
Cumulative Senior Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock having a liquidation
value of $50 per share and a conversion price of $24.9046875 per share (the
"Series 1 Preferred Stock"), warrants to purchase 5,000,400 shares of the LDDS
Common Stock, and $150.0 million in cash. The common stock of Resurgens was
unchanged in the Prior Mergers.

This LDDS Adjusted Historical Income Statement should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements of LDDS, MCC and
Resurgens.

The LDDS Adjusted Historical Income Statement is presented for
comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of actual
results had the transactions occurred as of the date indicated above nor does
it purport to indicate results which may be attained in the future.

NOTES TO LDDS ADJUSTED HISTORICAL INCOME STATEMENT

1. These columns represent the historical results of operations of
Dial-Net, MCC and Resurgens, respectively for the period from January
1, 1993 to their respective date of acquisition by LDDS.

2. These adjustments eliminate the revenues and corresponding line costs
attributable to the intercompany traffic between MCC and Resurgens.

3. This adjustment represents the amortization expense of the excess of
cost over net tangible assets acquired in the Prior Mergers. The
excess purchase price over net tangible assets acquired has been
recorded based upon an estimate of fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. A final allocation of the purchase price will be
determined when appraisals and other studies relating to fixed assets
and the utilization of MCC's and Resurgens' net operating loss
carryforwards are completed. The excess cost over net tangible assets
acquired is composed primarily of goodwill which is amortized over 40
years using the straight-line method.

4. This adjustment represents the amortization of the excess cost over
net tangible assets acquired in the Dial-Net acquisition. The excess
cost over net tangible assets acquired is comprised primarily of
goodwill and customer base which are amortized over 40 years and 10
years, respectively, using the straight-line method.

5. This adjustment represents the recognition of interest expense on the
additional borrowings of LDDS to fund the transaction costs of the
Prior Mergers. The interest expense was calculated based on LDDS's
incremental borrowing rate of 6.25% at December 31, 1993. A change of
1/8% in the assumed rate would affect interest expense by $145,000
for the year ended December 31, 1993.

6. This adjustment represents the recognition of interest expense on
additional borrowings of LDDS to fund the acquisition of Dial-Net. The
interest expense was calculated at LDDS's incremental borrowing rate
at December 31, 1993 of 6.25% per annum. A change of 1/8% in the
assumed rate would affect interest expense by $8,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1993.

7. These adjustments represent the tax effect of adjustments due to
inclusion of the acquired operations. The tax provisions were provided
at a combined federal and state rate of 39% applied to items impacting
taxable income. For purposes of the pro forma provision for income
taxes for the year ended December 31, 1993, loss carryovers utilized
by MCC and Resurgens were eliminated because utilization of such
carryovers after the Prior Mergers would have resulted in adjustments
to goodwill.

8. This adjustment represents the recognition of dividends on the Series
1 Preferred Stock issued to the MCC shareholder. The Series 1
Preferred Stock provides for dividends at the rate of $24.5 million
per year.

9. Pro forma per share data are based on the number of LDDS common and
common equivalent shares that would have been outstanding had the
acquisitions of Dial-Net, MCC and Resurgens occurred on January 1,
1993.

IDB ADJUSTED HISTORICAL INCOME STATEMENT

The following unaudited IDB Adjusted Historical Income Statement for
the year ended December 31, 1993, illustrates the effect of IDB's acquisition
in September 1993 of TRT for a cash payment of $1.0 million and the issuance of
10.1 million shares of IDB Common Stock valued at approximately $79.0 million.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The IDB Adjusted Historical
Income Statement assumes that the TRT acquisition occurred at January 1, 1993.

The IDB Adjusted Historical Income Statement should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements of IDB and TRT.

The IDB Adjusted Historical Income Statement is presented for
comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of actual
results had the transactions occurred as of the dates indicated above nor does
it purport to indicate results which may be attained in the future.

NOTES TO IDB ADJUSTED HISTORICAL INCOME STATEMENT

1. IDB reclassified payments to foreign telephone companies to complete
calls made from the United States by IDB's customers. These payments,
which previously were classified as direct reductions of transmission
services revenue, are now classified as cost of sales. Operating
income (loss), net income (loss) available to common shareholders and
the balance sheet are not affected. The amount of revenue reported by
IDB for the years ended prior to December 31, 1993 do not reflect this
reclassification because the amounts subject to reclassification were
not material.

2. This column represents the results of operations of TRT for the period
from January 1, 1993 to the date of acquisition by IDB. The historical
revenues and cost of sales of TRT have been adjusted to reclassify the
payments to foreign telephone companies from a direct reduction of
revenue to cost of sales.

3. Restructuring cost savings will accrue from the combination, as a
direct result of reductions in operating labor force and the
elimination of duplicative facilities, including reductions in
duplicative management, administrative locations and selling and
administrative functions. The pro forma adjustments are based on
management estimates of the actual effects of restructuring decisions
and are presented as if the restructuring were completed as of January
1, 1993.
