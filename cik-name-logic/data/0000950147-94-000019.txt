Item 2. Other Events.

On February 14, 1994, GFC Financial Corporation ("GFCFC"), through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Greyhound Financial Corporation ("GFC"), acquired
Fleet Factors Corporation, operating under the trade name Ambassador Factors
("Ambassador"), from Fleet Financial Group, Inc. ("Fleet"). The purchase
price of the acquisition was $257,085,000 in cash and represented
Ambassador's stockholder's equity plus a premium and repayment of the
intercompany balance due from Ambassador to Fleet. GFC financed the
acquisition with proceeds received from the sale of GFCFC's discontinued
mortgage insurance subsidiary and cash generated from operations which was
previously used to repay outstanding commercial paper. GFCFC, simultaneous
with the acquisition, increased its investment in GFC by contributing
$40,000,000 of intercompany loans as additional paid in capital of GFC.
