Item 5. Other Events

On May 2, 1994, Registrant issued the following press
release:

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- Caesars World, Inc. (NYSE/CAW)
today said it estimates that earnings per share for its
fiscal 1994 third quarter will range between 42 cents and 50
cents, compared with 69 cents per share in the fiscal 1993
third quarter.

The company said table-game activity in its Nevada
operations established a record for any third quarter in
Caesars World's history. The lower earnings, when compared
with the prior-year quarter, principally resulted from
increased expenses related to the higher volume of business
in Nevada, including a world heavyweight championship fight
at Caesars Palace and marketing expenses reflecting a higher
provision for bad debt. Table-game win percentages in Nevada
were lower than normal but about the same as the year-earlier
quarter. 

Estimates indicate that earnings per share for the
fiscal 1994 nine months ended April 30, 1994, will range
between $2.46 and $2.54, compared with $2.36 per share in the
same fiscal 1993 period. Both the third-quarter and nine-
month comparisons are based on approximately the same number
of common and common equivalent shares outstanding.
