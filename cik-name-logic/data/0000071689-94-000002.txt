Form 8-K New York Telephone Company

Item 5. Other Events

New York Telephone Company (the "Company") had a net loss of 
$7.7 million in 1993, compared with net income of $856.4 million for 
1992. The 1993 results include after-tax charges of 
$806.0 million. $497 million of these charges were for business 
restructuring, primarily related to efforts to redesign operations 
to improve efficiency and customer service, including consolidation 
of work locations and lease terminations, retraining employees, 
relocation expenses, system re-engineering, and other incremental 
costs associated with work force reductions. The Company expects to 
reduce its work force by approximately 9,000 employees by the end of 
1996. In addition, approximately $152 million of after-tax 
restructure costs were allocated to the Company from a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Company and New England Telephone and Telegraph 
Company, Telesector Resources Group, Inc., primarily related to its 
restructuring. Included in the after-tax charges is $89 million for 
the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment 
Benefits", effective January 1, 1993, and a $49 million reversal of 
deferred pension costs ordered by the New York State Public Service 
Commission.

Operating revenues were $7,847.0 million for 1993, up 1.3 percent 
from $7,746.4 million for 1992. Operating expenses in 1993 were 
$7,504.6 million. Excluding the effect of business restructuring 
and other charges, operating expenses for 1993 were 
$6,265.7 million, an increase of .1 percent from $6,258.7 million in 
1992.

There were 10,223,779 access lines in service at December 31, 1993, 
an increase of 2.5 percent over the same period last year. The 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges, which reflects the effect of the 
restructuring charges, was 1.04 for the year ended December 31, 1993.
