Item 5. Other Events.
- ------ ------------

AmSouth Bancorporation is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to
report its preliminary results of operations for the first quarter of 1994.

On April 19, 1994, AmSouth Bancorporation reported record net income of
$41.3 million for the first quarter of 1994, a 10.4 percent increase over
first quarter 1993 earnings. On a per share basis, first quarter 1994 earnings
were $.80 per common share.

"We are delighted to achieve our 13th consecutive quarter of record net
income, and we are pleased that our first quarter financial results reflect
continuing progress toward the ambitious long-term goals we have set for our
company," John W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of AmSouth
Bancorporation, said.

AmSouth's first quarter performance resulted in a return on average
assets of 1.30 percent and a return on average shareholders' equity of 14.64
percent.

AmSouth's gross interest spread was 4.57 percent in the first quarter of
1994, compared to 4.44 percent for the fourth quarter of 1993, and compared to
4.73 percent for the first quarter of 1993. The provision for loan losses for
the three months ended March, 31, 1994, totaled $1.0 million, the result of
continued good asset quality. Noninterest revenues declined $1.2 million over
first quarter 1993 levels to a first quarter 1994 amount of $48.0 million.
This decline is primarily attributable to losses in the portfolio trading
accounts due to market conditions. Noninterest expenses increased over the same
quarter of the previous year due to increased banking operations added through
purchases in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on February 1, 1993, and Ocala, Florida,
on December 9, 1993.

The corporation's total assets at March 31, 1994, increased to $13.2
billion, while AmSouth's shareholders' equity at quarter end was $1.1 billion.
Both are the highest quarter-end totals in the company's 22-year history.

"We are particularly pleased with our continued progress in assimilating
acquisitions in rapidly growing areas of Florida and northwest Georgia," Woods
said.

AmSouth continued its progress towards productivity improvements during
the first quarter. By quarter end, AmSouth had achieved 98 percent of its goal
of reducing employment in the core company by 750 positions. The productivity
improvement project was begun in mid 1993.

During the first quarter, Orange Bank headquartered in Orlando and
FloridaBank in Jacksonville were merged into AmSouth Bank of Florida, and
AmSouth signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Bank of Tampa. At quarter
end, AmSouth Bank of Florida reported total assets of $3.45 billion, making
AmSouth the fifth largest commercial bank in Florida.

In early April, Parkway Bank in Fort Myers and Citizens National Bank in
Naples became AmSouth Bancorporation affiliates. Additionally, AmSouth has now
received all regulatory approvals necessary for the merger with Fortune
Bancorp, Inc. The merger is subject to Fortune's shareholders' approval and
other closing conditions. The AmSouth-Fortune merger is scheduled for June 23.

In northwest Georgia, AmSouth completed the merger of First Federal
Savings Bank in Calhoun in early April and also signed a definitive agreement
to acquire Community Federal Savings Bank in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.

At March 31, 1994, AmSouth Bancorporation operated 268 banking offices in
four southeastern states: 148 banking offices in Alabama, 94 offices in
Florida, 21 offices in Tennessee and five in Georgia. Bank-related affiliates
include AmSouth Mortgage Company, Inc., with offices in nine Southeastern
states, AmSouth Investment Services, Inc., and AmSouth Leasing Corporation.
