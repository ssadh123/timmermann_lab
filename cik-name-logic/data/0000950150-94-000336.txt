ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On February 11, 1994, Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI), issued
the following news release:

HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES, INC. REPORTS
1993 EARNINGS; ANNOUNCES LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT

HONOLULU -- Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (NYSE-HE) today reported net
income for the year ended December 31, 1993 of $48.7 million, or $1.88 per
share, compared with a net loss of $11.6 million, or 48 cents per share, in
1992.

Results for 1993 include a charge of $15 million, or 58 cents per
share, to establish an additional reserve to cover the settlement of a lawsuit
filed by the Hawaii Insurance Commissioner and Hawaii Insurance Guaranty
Association (HIGA) against HEI. Under the agreement, HEI would pay $32 million
to the Insurance Commissioner as the rehabilitator/liquidator of the Hawaiian
Insurance Group (HIG) in return for a dismissal of the lawsuit and a release of
claims against HEI, its affiliates and their past and present officers and
directors. The $15 million charge is the net of tax cost of the settlement
after utilization of previously established reserves. The lawsuit was filed
after the December 1992 discontinuance of HEI's insurance business, HIG. The
discontinuance and writeoff of the business was primarily responsible for
1992's loss. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, was announced
February 10.

"We agreed to a settlement in order to get on with our business, and to
avoid the time, expense and risk a protracted lawsuit would inevitably entail.
The settlement will help diminish the insurance problems that our community is
experiencing," said Robert F. Clarke, President and Chief Executive Officer of
HEI. "HEI has been a responsible member of this community for many years and
engaging in prolonged litigation would not be in the best interests of HEI's
shareholders, HIG policyholders and the community."

For the three months ended December 31, 1993, HEI's net income was $2.5
million or 9 cents per share, versus a net loss of $4.4 million, or 18 cents
per share, in the same period of 1992.

For the year, earnings from continuing operations were essentially
unchanged from 1992 results at $61.7 million. However, as a result of a 7%
increase in the average number of shares outstanding, earnings per share from
continuing operations declined 6% to $2.38 in 1993. For the quarter, earnings
from continuing operations increased 5% to $17.3 million and earnings per share
were 63 cents, down 6%, from the same period in 1992.

Operating income at Hawaiian Electric Company and its subsidiaries
(HECO) was up 15% for the year and 28% for the quarter from 1992 levels due in
part to rate increases and the establishment of a regulatory asset for vacation
earned by employees, but not yet taken. Excluding the effect of this regulatory
asset, HECO operating income for the year was up 11% while net income was
relatively flat. Kilowatthour sales of electricity during the year were down
0.1% compared to 1992 primarily because of cooler weather, a downturn in the
state economy and conservation.

Operating income at American Savings Bank increased 41% for the year
and 24% in the quarter, primarily because of higher average loan balances and
increased net interest rate spread. Annual loan production was $564 million,
compared with $601 million in 1992. American Savings' spread -- the difference
between interest earned on assets and cost of funds -- was 3.99% in 1993,
compared with 3.45% in 1992.

"The bank's 1993 results are especially impressive, considering that
1992 operating income was up 24% from the prior year," Clarke said.

HEI's other nonutility operations were hampered in 1993 by Hawaii's
economic slowdown. In addition, Hawaiian Tug & Barge Corp. sold a tug and barge
for intrastate shipping of heavy fuel oil at a previously announced net loss of 
$1 million and has exited that line of business. The HEI corporate operating
loss from continuing operations increased $4.6 million in 1993 compared to 1992
primarily due to a refinement in the method of identifying costs chargeable to
subsidiaries, resulting in lower allocations to subsidiaries and more expenses
retained by the parent company.

Hawaiian Electric Industries is a diversified electric utility holding
company that delivers essential services to the people of Hawaii through its
electric utility, savings bank, maritime freight transportation and residential
real estate development subsidiaries.

- ----------------------

(1) Includes higher corporate general and administrative expenses due
to the refinement in the allocation of corporate-level expenses. 
For the quarter and year ended December 31, 1993, corporate-level 
expenses allocated to subsidiaries decreased approximately 
$2 million and $7 million, respectively.

(2) Income tax expense was greater than the same period last year
primarily due to five factors; (a) income from continuing operations 
increased, (b) recapture of tax benefits due to the sale of a barge 
constructed with cash from the Maritime Administration Capital 
Construction Fund (CCF), (c) maritime freight transportation operations 
can no longer recognize immediate tax benefits from contributions to 
the CCF because of the adoption of SFAS No. 109, (d) under SFAS No. 109, 
the tax calculated on AFUDC must be shown in income taxes rather than 
netted against AFUDC and (e) the federal tax rate increased 1% to 35%
retroactive to January 1, 1993. Also, income tax expense was relatively 
low in 1992 due to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards.

(3) In 1993, consolidated HECO established a regulatory asset for vacation
earned by employees, but not yet taken. The recognition of the regulatory 
asset increased 1993 operating income by $4.0 million and net income by 
$2.4 million.

Additional Information on Lawsuit Settlement

HEI will fund the settlement to be paid to the Insurance Commissioner
as rehabilitator/liquidator of the Hawaiian Insurance Group out of available
cash and short-term borrowings. HEI intends to seek reimbursement from certain 
of its insurance carriers. HEI's claims against its insurance carriers will 
require resolution of several insurance coverage and other policy issues and 
the outcome of such claims cannot be predicted at this time. Recoveries from 
HEI's insurance carriers, if any, will be recognized when realized.
