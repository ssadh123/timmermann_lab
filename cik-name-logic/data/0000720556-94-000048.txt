CALIFORNIA ENERGY CLOSES FINANCING ON THE SECOND
GEOTHERMAL PROJECT IN THE PHILIPPINES

OMAHA, NEBRASKA, August 15, 1994 -- California Energy Company,
Inc. (NYSE, PSE, and LSE symbol: CE) announced it has completed
financing for its 180 MW Mahanagdong geothermal project located
in the Philippines. The Mahanagdong geothermal project is the
second Philippine geothermal project for California Energy to
close financing on this year and, with the 120 MW Upper Mahiao
geothermal project already under construction, brings the
Company's total power under construction in the Philippines to
300 MW. The Mahanagdong project is expected to be in operation
by July of 1997.

David Sokol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We have
executed two major contracts which are not only the first of
their kind, but demonstrate our ability to deliver financing and
construction resources in a very short timeframe. With the close
of the Mahanagdong financing, our focus, as part of our
aggressive international development strategy, will be to
complete the negotiations on our other opportunities currently
identified in the Philippines and Indonesia."

The total project cost for the Mahanagdong facility is
approximately $320 million. The capital structure consists of a
term loan of $240 million provided by the Export-Import Bank of
the U.S. ("Ex-Im") and the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation ("OPIC") and approximately $80 million of equity
contributions ($40 million provided by the Company), which will
be insured against political risks by OPIC. The Ex-Im and OPIC
term loan funding is a ten-year project finance loan which will
be repaid from the cashflows of the project. The construction
loan will be provided by OPIC, Bank of America NT&SA and American
Pacific Finance Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of California
Energy). Ex-Im will provide insurance against political risks
during the construction period.

The electricity produced by the Mahanagdong geothermal power
plant will be provided to the Philippine National Oil Company,
Energy Development Corporation ("PNOC-EDC"), which is also
responsible for supplying the steam to the facility. After a
ten-year cooperation period, the plant will be transferred to
PNOC-EDC at no cost. 

"California Energy has come up with just the sort of project that
OPIC eagerly supports -- one that responds to real human need in
an environmentally sustainable and profitable way. We are
pleased to be able to help," said Ruth R. Harkin, President and
CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.

"We have been exceptionally pleased with the support and
professional staff at both PNOC-EDC and the other Philippine
government agencies involved. This also demonstrates to PNOC-EDC
our ability to perform development and financing of these
opportunities on an aggressive time schedule. Additionally, we
are very satisfied with this financing structure and the support
we have received from Ex-Im Bank and OPIC. We believe our
projects continue to be a good example of how the public and
private sector can work together to support American exports and
create job opportunities," said David Sokol.

California Energy Company is an international developer, owner
and operator of environmentally responsible power generation
facilities. Its six existing facilities currently produce in
excess of 300 MW of power with an additional 300 MW under
construction.
