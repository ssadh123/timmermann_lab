Independent Auditors' Report

To Board of Directors and Shareholders
Western Industrial National Bank
South El Monte, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
financial condition of Western Industrial National Bank and
subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Western Industrial National Bank and subsidiary
as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial
statements, Western Industrial National Bank changed its
method of accounting for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 1993.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of Western
Industrial National Bank (the "Bank") conform with
generally accepted accounting principles and general
practices within the banking industry. The following
are descriptions of the more significant of those
policies adopted by the Bank:

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Western Industrial National Bank and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Western WIN Corporation, after appropriate
intercompany eliminations.

Investment Securities - Investment securities are
carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts on a straight-line basis.
Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities
are determined using the specific identification method.
It is management's intent to hold investment securities
until maturity.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." This
statement addresses the accounting and reporting for
investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and all investments in debt
securities. Under this statement, debt securities will
be classified into three categories as follows:

Held-to-Maturity Securities - Debt securities that
the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold
to maturity. These securities are to be reported at
amortized cost.

Trading Securities - Debt and equity securities that
are bought and held principally for the purpose of
selling them in the near term. These securities are
to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses included in earnings.

Available-for-Sale Securities - Debt and equity
securities not classified as either held-to-maturity

<PAGE>

or trading securities. These securities are to be
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from earnings and reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity (net of
tax effects).

The Bank must adopt this standard by 1994. The Bank has
determined the impact of the adoption of this statement
to be immaterial to its financial statements.

Loans - Loans are reported at the principal amounts
outstanding, net of unearned income, net deferred loan
origination fees and allowance for credit losses.
Interest income on loans is accrued monthly on a simple-
interest basis on the daily balance of the principal
amounts outstanding. Interest income is not recognized
on loans receivable if collection of the interest is
deemed by management to be unlikely.

Nonrefundable fees and certain direct costs associated
with the origination or purchase of loans are deferred
and netted against outstanding loan balances. The net
deferred fees and costs are recognized in interest
income over the loan term using methods that generally
produce a level yield on the unpaid loan balance.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses - The
allowance for credit losses is based on estimates, and
ultimate losses may vary from current estimates. These
estimates are revised periodically, and, as adjustments
become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the
periods in which they become known. The allowance is
increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced
by net charge-offs. Management makes periodic credit
reviews of the loan portfolio and considers current
economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and
other factors in determining the adequacy of the
allowance.

<PAGE>
In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan." This statement
prescribes that a loan is impaired when it is probable
that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due (principal and interest) according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement. Measurement of
the impairment can be based on the expected future cash
flows of an impaired loan, which are to be discounted at
the loan's effective interest rate, or impairment can be
measured by reference to an observable market price, if
one exists, or the fair value of the collateral for a
collateral-dependent loan. Creditors may select the
measurement method on a loan-by-loan basis, except that
collateral-dependent loans for which foreclosure is
probable must be measured at the fair value of the
collateral. Additionally, the statement prescribes
measuring impairment of a restructured loan by
discounting the total expected future cash flows at the
loan's effective rate of interest in the original loan
agreement. Finally, the impact of initially applying
the statement is reported as a part of the provision for
credit losses. The Bank must adopt this standard by
1995. The Bank has not yet determined the impact of the
adoption of this statement, or when the Bank will adopt
this statement.

Real Estate Owned - Real estate owned, which represents
real estate acquired through foreclosure in satisfaction
of commercial and real estate loans, is stated at the
lower of cost or the estimated fair value of the real
estate less cost to sell. Loan balances in excess of
fair value of the real estate acquired at the date of
acquisition are charged against the allowance for credit
losses. Any subsequent operating expenses or income,
reduction in estimated values, and gains or losses on
disposition of such properties are charged to current
operations.

<PAGE>

Premises and Equipment - Premises and equipment are
carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed on the straight-
line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Amortization is computed on the straight-line
method over the useful lives of the leasehold
improvements or the term of the lease, whichever is
shorter.

Income Taxes - Effective January 1, 1993, the Bank
adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
Accordingly, income tax expense for 1993 was computed
using the liability method, which recognizes a liability
or asset representing the tax effects, based on current
tax law, of future deductible or taxable amounts
attributable to events that have been recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. The principal
temporary differences relate to different methods used
for tax and financial reporting purposes to account for
credit losses and depreciation.

For years prior to 1993, the provision for income taxes
is based on income reported for consolidated financial
statement purposes and differs from the amount of taxes
currently paid or payable. Prior years' financial
statements have not been restated for the accounting
change.

Earnings per Share - Earnings per share are computed
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each year, including the dilutive
effect of common stock options accounted for under the
treasury stock method. The weighted average number of
shares used in the computation was 380,902 and 379,758
for 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Statements of Cash Flows - Cash and cash equivalents as
reported in the statements of cash flows include cash
and due from banks and federal funds sold.

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1993, the gross unrealized loss on U.S.
Treasury securities was $173 and the gross unrealized
gain on municipal securities was $334. At December 31,
1992, gross unrealized gains on U.S. Treasury securities
and on municipal securities were $324 and $4,334,
respectively. There were no sales of investment
securities in 1993 or 1992. At December 31, 1993, U.S.
Treasury securities held mature within one year, and
municipal securities held mature in one to two years.

At December 31, 1993, certain U.S. Treasury securities
carried at $247,222 were pledged as collateral for
public funds on deposit with the Bank.

The Bank primarily grants commercial, consumer and real
estate loans to light industrial companies in South El
Monte, California and adjoining cities. A substantial
portion of the borrowers' ability to honor their debts
is dependent on the economy in this region, which has
recently experienced adverse conditions. Additional
declines in the economy may result in higher levels of
loan losses and larger provisions to the allowance for
loan losses. Although management believes the allowance
at December 31, 1993 is adequate, the allowance is an
estimate which is inherently uncertain and depends on
the outcome of future events that cannot reasonably be
predicted.

An analysis of the activity in the allowance for credit
losses is as follows:

Loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1993 and 1992
totaled $196,000 and $222,454, respectively. Interest
income not recognized in the consolidated financial
statements for loans on nonaccrual status at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $17,096 and $19,764,
respectively.

Certain officers, directors and employees of the Bank,
and companies with which directors of the Bank are
associated, had loans outstanding of $3,067,604 and
$2,858,411 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
These loans were made in the ordinary course of the
Bank's business and, in management's opinion, were made
at prevailing rates and terms.

5. DEPOSITS

Deposits of the Bank included time certificates of
deposit greater than $100,000 of $5,388,681 and
$5,883,556 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Interest expense for such deposits totaled $186,147 in
1993 and $313,164 in 1992.

6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The Bank leases land under its main branch under an
operating lease that, including renewal options, extends
through 2026. Lease expense was approximately $41,915
in 1993 and 1992. At December 31, 1993, future annual
lease commitments were as follows:

Year Ending
December 31

1994 $ 41,915
1995 41,915
1996 41,915
1997 41,915
1998 41,915
Thereafter 1,135,200
----------
$1,344,775
==========

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-
balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to
meet the financing needs of its customers. These
financial instruments include commitments to extend
credit. When viewed in terms of the maximum exposure,
those instruments may involve, to varying degrees,
credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the statement of financial condition. At
December 31, 1993, the Bank had commitments to extend
credit of $1,389,000 and to disburse $2,487,763 of
additional funds for existing loans. In addition, the
Bank had obligations under standby letters of credit of
$512,500.

In the normal course of business, the Bank occasionally
becomes a party to litigation. In the opinion of
management, after consultation with legal counsel,
pending or threatened litigation involving the Bank will
not have a material adverse effect on the Bank's
consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

<PAGE>
7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

The Bank has a stock option plan, divided into two parts
(A and B), that authorizes the issuance of up to 30,250
shares (as adjusted for the effect of stock dividends)
of common stock and expires November 3, 1992. Options
are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair
market value or par value, whichever is greater, at the
date of grant. Options granted under parts A and B of
the plan were exercisable beginning in 1984 and 1987,
respectively, in installments as determined by the Board
of Directors. All options expire ten years after the
date of grant. Upon a change in control of the Bank all
options become fully vested.

Activity in the stock option plan for the two years
ended December 31, 1993 was as follows:

Options Price Options

Balance - January 1, 1992 9,184 $ 6.83 to $15.00 18,455
Options granted (4,600) $20.00 4,600

Options exercised $6.83 (1,098)

Options canceled 2,577 $10.52 to $13.64 (2,577)

Plan termination (7,161) -------

Balance - December 31, 1992 $ 6.83 to $20.00 19,380

Options canceled $ 6.83 to $20.00 (2,386)
------
Balance - December 31, 1993 $ 6.83 to $20.00 16,994
======

At December 31, 1993, 7,739 of the shares currently
under option are exercisable at prices varying from
$6.83 to $15.00. An additional 1,997 options become
exercisable in 1994 at prices varying from $6.83 to
$20.00 per share.

8. INCOME TAXES

On January 1, 1993, the Bank adopted SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the provisions of
SFAS No. 109, the Bank elected not to restate prior year
financial statements.

The provision for income taxes consisted of the
following:

Year Ended
December 31
1993 1992 

Income taxes currently paid or payable:
Federal $ 579,400 $ 595,241
State 235,121 212,213
--------- ---------
814,521 807,454
--------- ---------
Deferred taxes (benefit) applicable to temporary differences:

Federal (92,646) (57,241)
State (28,675) (25,863)
--------- ---------
(121,321) (83,104)
--------- ---------
$ 693,200 $724,350
========= ========

The net income tax liability (asset) comprised the
following:

Year Ended 
December 31
------------------- 
1993 1992

Current
Federal $ 40,612 $ 7,203
State (12,027) (3,435)

Deferred:
Federal $(17,692) 45,039
State 12,288 14,148
-------- -------
$(5,404) $59,187
======== =======
<PAGE>

The components of the net deferred tax liability (asset)
are as follows:

<TABLE>

Provision for credit losses (1,404)

Provision for credit losses (2,637)
-------- -------
Gross deferred tax assets (2,637)
-------- -------
Net deferred tax liability - state $12,288 $14,148
======== =======
</TABLE>

No valuation allowance under SFAS No. 109 is required.
Deferred tax assets can be fully realized as an offset
against reversing temporary differences, which create
net future tax liabilities, or through loss carrybacks.
Therefore, even if no future income was expected,
deferred tax assets would still be fully realized.

<PAGE>

The provision for income taxes differs from the federal
statutory tax rates for the following reasons:

Year Ended December 31
-----------------------------------------
1993 1992
Amount Percent Amount Percent

Provision for income taxes at
statutory rate 572,328 34.0% $587,811 34.0%
State franchise tax, net of
federal tax benefit 136,254 8.1% 125,688 7.3%
Other, net (15,382) (0.9)% 10,851 0.6%
---------- ----- -------- -----
$ 693,200 41.2% 724,350 41.9%
========== ===== ======== =====

9. REGULATORY MATTERS

All depository institutions are required by law to
maintain reserves on transaction accounts and
nonpersonal time deposits in the form of cash balances
at the Federal Reserve Bank. These reserve requirements
can be offset by cash balances held at the Bank. At
December 31, 1993, the Bank's cash balance was
sufficient to offset the Federal Reserve requirement.

The Bank is required by federal regulations to meet
certain capital standards. The risk-based capital
standard requires the Bank to achieve a minimum ratio of
total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8% (of which at
least 4% must contain Tier 1 capital, which consists
primarily of common stock and retained earnings, less
goodwill). At December 31, 1993, the Bank had risk-
weighted and Tier 1 ratios of 20.8% and 19.6%,
respectively.

The Bank is also required to achieve a minimum leverage
ratio of 4%, based on Tier 1 capital divided by average
total assets. The leverage ratio operates in
conjunction with the above risk-based capital
guidelines. The Bank met both the risk-based capital
standard and the minimum leverage ratio at December 31,
1993 and 1992, and management believes that the Bank
will continue to meet all capital standards for 1994.
At December 31, 1993, the Bank had a leverage ratio of
17.8%.

10. ACQUISITION

The Bank entered into a definitive agreement in December
1993 with another financial institution pursuant to
which the Bank will be purchased by the other financial
institution. The definitive agreement requires the

<PAGE>

approval of the Bank's shareholders and the regulatory
authorities. The financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis, and therefore no
adjustments have been made for the proposed
acquisitions.

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In January 1994, the Greater Los Angeles area was
seriously affected by a major earthquake and attendant
aftershocks centered in the San Fernando Valley.
Although the Bank's main operations and customers are
not located in the most seriously affected areas,
management has initiated, but not completed, efforts to
evaluate the effect of the earthquake on the Bank's
operations and customers.

However, based on the Bank's evaluations to date,
management believes the effects of the earthquake will
not be material to the Bank.

The Bank's facilities and other real estate owned
suffered no significant damage as a result of the
earthquake.
