Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On January 19, 1994 shareholders of Registrant voted to approve
the merger (the "Merger") of BCD Acquisition Corporation ("BCD"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant, into Baroid Corporation
("Baroid"). The Merger was effective January 21, 1994 (the "Effective

Agreement") dated September 7, 1993, among Registrant, BCD and Baroid.
Shareholders of Baroid on the Effective Date will receive 37,286,662
million shares of Registrant's Common Stock in exchange for all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Baroid. In addition, approximately
3.6 million shares of Registrant's Common Stock are reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase Baroid
common stock and for issuance pursuant to certain benefit plans assumed
by Registrant. For financial reporting purposes, the Merger will be
treated as a pooling of interests combination. Baroid operations

owned subsidiary of Baroid. In addition, Registrant must also dispose
of the United States diamond drill bit business of DB Stratabit, Inc.
("DBS") and grant to the purchaser a non-exclusive license to
manufacture steel-bodied diamond drill bits worldwide. Divestiture of
the drilling fluids business must occur by June 1, 1994 and the diamond
drill bit transaction must occur by July 1, 1994.

On January 27, 1994, Registrant announced that it had agreed in
