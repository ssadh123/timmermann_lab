New York, NY October 3, 1994

PLY GEM Announces Actions To Improve Profitability and Shareholder Value
Restructuring to Save Approximately $12 Million Annually

New York, NY . . . October 3, 1994 . . . . PLY GEM Industries, Inc. (Amex: PGI) 
today announced a restructuring to improve profitability and position the 
company for quality long term growth.

According to Chairman and CEO Jeffrey S. Silverman, "The restructuring announced
today is another important step in positioning PGI to succeed in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace. The actions we are taking will result in a 
fundamental change in the way our company does business. We are creating a new 
organization sharply changed in how it thinks, works, reacts and capitalizes on 
business opportunities. These changes are being initiated by our new President 
Monte R. Haymon, based upon an evaluation of our businesses to determine how 
operating performance could be improved and shareholder value enhanced."

The profit improvement actions involve delayering the organization, changing 
business processes, utilizing facilities more effectively, and improving product
line management.

These actions, which will be implemented over the next twelve months, will have
the following significant results:

. Upon full implementation, PLY GEM should realize annual pretax savings of 
approximately $12 million.

. A reduction of approximately 15% of the work force, or approximately 600
jobs will be effected.

. PLY GEM will record a third quarter one time non-recurring pretax charge of 
$36.3 million consisting of the restructuring charge and other non-recurring
items. This charge includes $14 million of non cash charges for asset write-
offs including facility closures.

. A consolidation of selected regional distribution facilities and certain 
manufacturing facilities to reduce fixed expenses.

. The restructuring of basic business operations involving the way PLY GEM 
deals with its customers, suppliers, and employees.

"We are making these changes at a time when our financial results are strong. 
Our businesses are sound, profitable and growing, and they will become even more
competitive as a result of these actions. We are committed to optimizing the 
linkages between various business processes which will enhance our ability to 
profitably select, serve and satisfy customers in ways no competitor can match,"
said PLY GEM President and COO Monte R. Haymon.

"We are not changing the business we are in, but are fundamentally changing the 
way we think and the way we work so that we can provide leading edge products 
and services to our customers. These changes are the result of an in-depth 
study of each of our businesses to determine how to improve productivity, 
quality and customer satisfaction while reducing costs. We are challenging the 
'business as usual' mentality and making major changes in our organizational 
structure and business processes to create a world class manufacturer of 
specialty products for the home improvement industry. These actions should 
enable PLY GEM to reach dramatically higher levels of profitability and to build
a foundation for future success," concluded Mr. Haymon.
