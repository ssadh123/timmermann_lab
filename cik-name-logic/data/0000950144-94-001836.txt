Item 5. Other Events

The Actava Group Inc. ("Actava") and Metromedia Company ("Metromedia")
have entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of October 11, 1994 (the "Credit
Agreement") under which Actava will make loans to Metromedia in an amount not
to exceed $55 million. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, Metromedia
will use the proceeds of the loans to make advances to or pay obligations on
behalf of Orion Pictures Corporation ("Orion"), MCEG Sterling Incorporated
("MCEG Sterling"), and Metromedia International Telecommunications Inc.
("MITI"). All loans made by Actava to Metromedia under the Credit Agreement
will be secured by the shares of stock of Orion and MITI owned by Metromedia
and its affiliates. In addition, John W. Kluge, a general partner of
Metromedia, has personally guaranteed the loans.

On August 31, 1994, Actava, Orion, MCEG Sterling and MITI entered into
letters of intent providing for a combination of the foregoing companies into
one new company to be named Metromedia International Group Inc. (the "Proposed
Transaction"). The Credit Agreement was contemplated by the letters of intent.
The Credit Agreement, however, is a separate transaction from the Proposed
Transaction, which remains subject to a number of conditions, including due
diligence, the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, the
successful refinancing of the currently outstanding Orion debt, approvals by
the Boards of Directors and stockholders of the parties involved in the
transaction, and other customary approvals and conditions.

The Credit Agreement provides that interest will be due on the
principal amount of all loans made under the Credit Agreement at an annual rate
equal to the prime rate announced from time to time by Chemical Bank. Interest
will be increased to prime plus three percent per annum if a party other than
Actava terminates discussions relating to the Proposed Transaction. All loans
will be due and payable on the earlier of April 30, 1995 or six months from the
date on which the first loan is made. The first loan was made on October 12,
1994 in the amount of $2 million. If Actava elects to terminate discussions
relating to the Proposed Transaction, then all loans will be due and payable
three months from the date on which such discussions are terminated.

SECTION 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF COMMITMENT

2.1 Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the Lender agrees to make loans ("Loans") to the Borrower from time to time
during the Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding not to exceed the amount of the Lender's Commitment. The Lender's
Commitment shall be reduced permanently by the amount of any Loans advanced by
the Lender pursuant to this Section 2 regardless of whether such Loans are
prepaid prior to the Termination Date.

<PAGE> 11

8

2.2 Note. The Loans made by the Lender shall be
evidenced by a promissory note of the Borrower, substantially in the form of
Exhibit A (the "Note"), payable to the order of the Lender and in a principal
amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of the initial Commitment of the
Lender and (b) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans made by the
Lender.

2.3 Procedure for Borrowing. The Borrower may borrow under
the Commitment during the Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided that
the Borrower shall give the Lender irrevocable notice (which notice must be
received by the Lender prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time, one Business Day
prior to the requested Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount to be
borrowed and (ii) the requested Borrowing Date. Each borrowing under the
Commitment shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof (or, if the then Available Commitment is less than
$100,000, such lesser amount). The Lender will make the amount of each
borrowing available to the Borrower by 11:00 A.M. New York City time by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account maintained by the
Borrower and specified in writing to the Lender.

2.4 Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may at any time and
from time to time upon three (3) days advance notice to the Lender, prepay the
Loans, in whole or in part,

<PAGE> 12
9

without premium or penalty. Such prepayment shall be applied first to interest
and then to principal.

2.5 Interest Rates and Payment Dates.

(a) Each Loan shall bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Prime Rate;provided, however, upon the occurrence of an
Orion/MITI Termination Event, each Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate plus 3%.

(b) If all or a portion of (i) the principal
amount of any Loan or (ii) any interest payable thereon shall not be paid when
due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such
overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is (x) in the case
of overdue principal, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection plus 2% or (y) in the
case of overdue interest, the Prime Rate plus 2%, in each case from the date of
such non-payment until such amount is paid in full.

(c) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this subsection shall be payable from time to time on demand.

2.6 Computation of Interest. Interest shall be calculated on
the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. Any change in the
interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Prime Rate shall become
effective as of the opening of business on the day on which

<PAGE> 13

10

such change becomes effective. The Lender shall as soon as practicable notify
the Borrower of the effective date and the amount of each such change in
interest rate.

2.7 Payments. All payments (including prepayments) to be
made by the Borrower hereunder and under the Note, whether on account of
principal, interest, or otherwise, shall be made without set off or
counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the
due date thereof to the Lender in immediately available funds. If any payment
hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with
respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then
applicable rate during such extension.

2.8 Payment Date. All principal and any unpaid interest
outstanding hereunder shall be due and payable in full on the Termination Date.

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 

To induce the Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make
the Loans, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Lender that:

<PAGE> 14

11

erty it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently
engaged, and (c) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the
extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.2 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The
Borrower has the partnership power and authority, and the legal right, to make,

(e) Upon delivery to the Lender of the stock certificates evidencing the
Pledged Stock, the security interest created by this Agreement will constitute
a valid, perfected first priority security interest in the Collateral,
enforceable in accordance with its terms against all creditors of the Borrower
and any Persons purporting to purchase any Collateral from the Borrower, except
as affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

5. Covenants. The Borrower covenants and agrees with the Lender on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Affiliates that, from and after the date of this
Agreement until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created
hereby are released:

(a) if the Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, shall, as
a result of their ownership of the Pledged Stock, become entitled to receive or
shall receive any stock certificate (including, without limitation, any
certificate representing a stock dividend or a distribution in connection with
any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital or any certificate
issued in connection with any reorganization), option or rights, whether in
addition to, in substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange for any
shares of the Pledged Stock, or otherwise in respect thereof, the Borrower
and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, shall accept the same as the agent
of the Lender, hold the same in trust for the Lender and deliver the same
forthwith to the Lender in the exact form received, duly endorsed by the
Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, to the Lender, if required,
together with an undated stock power covering such certificate duly executed in
blank by the Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, to be held by
the Lender, subject to the terms hereof, as additional collateral security for
the Obligations. Any sums paid upon or in respect of the Pledged Stock upon
the liquidation or dissolution of either of the Issuers shall be paid over to
the Lender to be held by it hereunder as additional collateral security for the
Obligations, and in case any distribution of capital shall be made on or in
respect of the Pledged Stock or any property shall be distributed upon or with
respect to the Pledged Stock pursuant to the recapitalization or
reclassification of the capital of the Issuers or pursuant to the
reorganization thereof, the property so distributed shall be delivered to the
Lender to be held by it hereunder as additional collateral security for the
Obligations. If any sums of money or property so

<PAGE> 5
5

paid or distributed in respect of the Pledged Stock shall be received by the
Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, the Borrower and/or the
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall, until such money or property is paid or
delivered to the Lender, hold such money or property in trust for the Lender,
segregated from other funds of the Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case
may be, as additional collateral security for the Obligations.

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Lender, the Borrower will
not and will cause the Affiliates not to (i) sell, assign, transfer, exchange,
or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, the Collateral or
(ii) create, incur or permit to exist any Lien or option in favor of, or any
claim of any Person with respect to, any of the Collateral, or any interest
therein, except for the security interests created by this Agreement.

(c) The Borrower shall maintain the security interest created by this
Agreement as a first, perfected security interest and shall defend such
security interest against claims and demands for all persons whomsoever. At
any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Lender, and at
the sole expense of the Borrower, the Borrower will, or will cause the
appropriate Affiliates to, promptly and duly execute and deliver such further
instruments and documents and take such further actions as the Lender may
reasonably request for the purposes of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted. If any
amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral shall be or
become evidenced by any promissory note, other instrument or chattel paper,
such note, instrument or chattel paper shall be immediately delivered to the
Lender, duly endorsed in a manner satisfactory to the Lender, to be held as
Collateral pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) The Borrower shall pay, and save the Lender harmless from, any and
all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, any and
all stamp, excise, sales or other taxes which are payable with respect to any
of the Collateral or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

6. Cash Dividends; Voting Rights. Unless an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Borrower and the Affiliates, as the case may
be, shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends paid in the normal course
of business of the Issuers in respect of the Pledged Stock and to exercise all
voting and corporate rights with respect to the Pledged Stock.

<PAGE> 6

7. Rights of the Lender.

(a) All money Proceeds received by the Lender hereunder shall be held by
the Lender in a Collateral Account. All Proceeds while held by the Lender in a
Collateral Account (or by the Borrower or the Affiliates in trust for the
Lender) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all the
Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided
in paragraph 8(a).

(b) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing (i) the Lender
shall have the right to receive any and all cash dividends paid in respect of
the Pledged Stock and make application thereof to the Obligations in such order
as the Lender may determine, (ii) all shares of the Pledged Stock may at
Lender's election, be registered in the name of the Lender or its nominee, and
(iii) the Lender or its nominee may exercise (A) all voting, corporate and
other rights pertaining to such shares of the Pledged Stock at any meeting of
shareholders of the Issuers or otherwise and (B) any and all rights of
conversion, exchange, subscription and any other rights, privileges or options
pertaining to such shares of the Pledged Stock as if it were the absolute owner
thereof. In such event, the Lender shall account to the Borrower promptly for
property actually received by it on account of the Pledged Shares.

8. Remedies.

(a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any
time at the Lender's election, the Lender may apply all or any part of Proceeds
held in any Collateral Account in payment of the Obligations in such order as
the Lender may elect.

(b) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Lender may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted in
this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or
relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under
the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lender, may in
such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the
Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, assign, give option
or options to purchase or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or
any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more
parcels at public or private sale or sales, in the over-the-counter market, at
any exchange, broker's board or office of the Lender or elsewhere upon such
terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem
best, for cash or on credit or

<PAGE> 7
7

for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Lender shall
have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted
by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part
of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in the
Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, which right or equity is
hereby waived or released. The Lender shall apply any Proceeds from time to
time held by it and the net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt,
appropriation, realization or sale, to the payment in whole or in part of the
Obligations, in such order as the Lender may elect, and after such application
and after the payment by the Lender of any other amount required by any
provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-504(1)(c) of the
Code, the Lender shall account for the surplus, if any, to the Borrower and/or
the Affiliates, as the case may be. The Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale
or other disposition of Collateral are insufficient to pay the Obligations and
the reasonable fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Lender
to collect such deficiency.

9. Private Sales.

(a) The Borrower recognizes that the Lender may be unable to effect a
public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of certain prohibitions
contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or
otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof
to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other
things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not
with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The Lender shall be under
no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock for the period of
time necessary to permit the applicable Issuer thereof to register such
securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state
securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.

(b) The Borrower further agrees to use its reasonable efforts to do or
cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or
sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section valid
and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of
Law.

10. Irrevocable Authorization and Instruction to Issuers. The Borrower
and the Affiliates, on behalf of the Borrower, hereby authorize and instruct
each of the Issuers to comply with any instruction received by it from the
Lender in writing that (a) states that an Event of Default

<PAGE> 8
8

has occurred and (b) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, without any other or further instructions from the Borrower and/or
the Affiliates, as the case may be, and the Borrower and the Affiliates, on
behalf of the Borrower, agree that the Issuer shall be fully protected in so
complying.

11. Lender's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact. The Borrower and the
Affiliates, on behalf of the Borrower, hereby irrevocably constitute and
appoint the Lender and any officer or agent of the Lender, with full power of
substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable
power and authority in the place and stead of the Borrower and the Affiliates
and in the name of the Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, or
in the Lender's own name, from time to time in the Lender's discretion, for the
purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all
appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which
may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any financing statements, endorsements,
assignments or other instruments of transfer. All powers, authorizations and
agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are
irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests
created hereby are released.

12. Duty of Lender. The Lender's sole duty with respect to the custody,
safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession,
under Section 9-207 of the Code or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the
same manner as the Lender deals with similar securities and property for its
own account, except that the Lender shall have no obligation to invest funds
held in any Collateral Account and may hold the same as demand deposits. Upon
payment in full by the Borrower or Guarantor of the Obligations, the Lender
shall promptly return the Collateral to the Borrower.

13. Execution of Financing Statements. Pursuant to Section 9-402 of the
Code, the Borrower and the Affiliates, on behalf of the Borrower, authorize the
Lender to file financing statements with respect to the Collateral without the
signature of the Borrower and/or the Affiliates, as the case may be, in such
form and in such filing offices and the Lender reasonably determines
appropriate to perfect the security interests of the Lender under this
Agreement. A carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement
shall be sufficient as a financing statement for filing in any jurisdiction.
Upon termination of the Commitment and repayment in full of all Obligations,
the Lender shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower

<PAGE> 9
9

and the Affiliates, on behalf of the Borrower, take any actions requested to
terminate any financing statements.

14. Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Lender or
the Borrower and the Affiliates to be effective shall be in writing (or by
telex, fax or similar electronic transfer confirmed in writing) and shall be
deemed to have been duly given or made (1) when delivered by hand or (2) if
given by mail, when deposited in the mails by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or (3) if by telex, fax or similar electronic transfer, when sent
and receipt has been confirmed, addressed to the Lender or the Borrower at its
address or transmission number for notices provided in subsection 7.2 of the
Credit Agreement. The Lender and the Borrower may change their addresses and
transmission numbers for notices in the manner provided in this Section. The
Borrower shall have the authority to receive all notices on behalf of the
Affiliates.

15. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibitions or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

16. Amendments in Writing; No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.

(a) None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be modified
except by a written instrument executed by the Borrower, the Affiliates and the
Lender, provided that any provision of this Agreement may be waived by the
Lender in a letter or agreement executed by the Lender.

(b) The Lender shall not by any act (except by a written instrument
pursuant to paragraph 16(a) hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise
be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in
any Default or Event of Default or in any breach of any of the terms and
conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the
part of the Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Lender of any right or
remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any
right or remedy which the Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion.

<PAGE> 10
10

(c) The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be
exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or
remedies provided by law.

17. Security Interest Absolute. The obligations of the Borrower and the
Affiliates hereunder shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected
by: (i) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in
respect of any obligation of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement or any
other Loan Document, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any renewal,
extension, modification, amendment or restatement of or supplement to the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iii) any release, non-perfection
or invalidity of any security for any obligation of the Borrower under the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv) any change in the
partnership existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower and/or the
Affiliates or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting the Borrower and/or the Affiliates, their assets or any
resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Borrower and/or the
Affiliates contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document; (v)
the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Borrower and/or
the Affiliates may have at any time against one another or against the Lender,
whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transaction, provided that
nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit
or compulsory counterclaim; (vi) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to
or against the Borrower for any reason of the Credit Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to
prohibit the payment by the Borrower of the principal of or interest on the
Note or any other amount payable by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement; or
(vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower,
the Affiliates or the Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance
whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a
legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's and/or the Affiliates'
obligations hereunder (other than the indefeasible payment in full of the
Obligations by the Borrower).

18. Section Headings. The section headings used in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction hereof or
be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.

19. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of the Borrower and the Affiliates and shall inure to
the benefit of the Lender and its successors and assigns. The Lender shall

<PAGE> 11

11

have the right to assign or pledge its rights under this Agreement with the
consent of the Borrower and the Affiliates, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

20. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed and delivered as of the date first above written.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to the Credit Agreement (the "Credit
Agreement") dated as of October 11, 1994 by and among The Actava Group Inc., as
lender (the "Lender"), and Metromedia Company, as borrower (the "Borrower").

As a condition precedent to the making of Loans by the Lender
to the Borrower, the undersigned has undertaken, as guarantor (the
"Guarantor"), irrevocably and unconditionally to guarantee the Borrower's
obligations under the Credit Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth
herein.

The making of Loans under the Credit Agreement will be of
direct interest and benefit to the Guarantor. For and in consideration of good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged by the Guarantor, and for the purpose of inducing the Lender to
extend credit to the Borrower, the Guarantor does hereby make the following
guaranties to and agreements with the Lender.

1. Definitions. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
in this Guaranty shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit
Agreement. As used in this Guaranty, the following terms have the following
meanings unless the context otherwise requires:

"Guaranteed Obligations" has the meaning ascribed to
such term in Section 2.
<PAGE> 2
2

"Guaranty" means the Guaranty, as it may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.

"Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse
effect on (a) the property, condition (financial or otherwise) or
prospects of the Guarantor or (b) the validity or enforceability of
this Guaranty or the rights or remedies of the Lender hereunder.

2. The Guaranty.

2.1 The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3
of this Guaranty, the due and punctual payment in full of any and all sums,
whether of principal or interest (including any default interest), payable by
Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents, including without limitation, the
Credit Agreement and the Note, as and when the same may be or become due and
payable, whether at maturity or upon acceleration or otherwise, and the
Guarantor does hereby guarantee, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 3 of this Guaranty, the full and prompt performance of any and all
obligations whatsoever of the Borrower under the Loan Documents, whether such
obligations now exist or arise hereafter (the "Guaranteed Obligations"). This
Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in effect until all of the
Guaranteed Obligations have been completely performed and paid in full.

2.2 The Guarantor does hereby agree that if the
Note is not paid by the Borrower in accordance with its terms for any reason
whatsoever, or if any and all sums which are now due or may hereafter become
due from the Borrower to the Lender under the Loan Documents are not paid by
the Borrower in accordance with their terms for any reason whatsoever, the
Guarantor, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3 of this Guaranty,
will immediately make such payments. The Guarantor further agrees to pay or
reimburse the Lender for all of its reasonable, direct, actual out-of-pocket
costs incurred in connection with the enforcement of any rights under this
Guaranty or to enforce any other obligations guaranteed hereby. The provisions
of this Guaranty shall extend and be applicable to all renewals, replacements,
amendments, extensions, consolidations and modifications of the Loan Documents,
and any and all references herein to the Loan Documents or any of them shall be
deemed to include any such renewals, replacements, amendments, extensions,
consolidations or modifications thereof.

<PAGE> 3

3. Exercise of Rights Under Guaranty. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Guarantor shall have no
obligation to make any payments to Lender hereunder, and Lender shall not have
the right to exercise, to make any claim against or demand of the Guarantor
under, or to enforce this Guaranty, until the occurrence and continuation of an
Event of Default and an acceleration of the Loans (except that acceleration
shall not be a condition precedent to the exercise of any such rights in the
case of maturity of any Loans at the Termination Date) each as set forth in
Section 6 of the Credit Agreement.

4. Liability of the Guarantor.

4.1 The Guarantor agrees that its obligations
hereunder are absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever (other than the indefeasible payment in full and
complete performance of the Guaranteed Obligations) which may constitute a
legal or equitable discharge (whether in whole or in part) of a guarantor or
surety.

4.2 This is a guaranty of payment and performance
and not of collection. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3 of
this Guaranty, the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any
remedies against the Borrower or any other person, nor against the Collateral.
The Guarantor waives any right to require that an action be brought against the
Borrower or any other Person or require that resort be had to any of the
Collateral or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of
the Lender in favor of the Borrower or any other Person. In the event that, if
on account of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, or any other
debtor relief law of any jurisdiction whatsoever, now or hereafter in effect,
which may be or become applicable, the Borrower shall be relieved of or fail to
incur any debt, obligation or liability as provided in the Loan Documents, the
Guarantor shall nevertheless be fully liable therefor. In the event of an
Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, the Lender shall have the right to
enforce its rights, powers and remedies in any order, and all rights, powers
and remedies available to the Lender in such event shall be nonexclusive and
cumulative of all other rights, powers and remedies provided thereunder or by
law or in equity.

4.3 The Guarantor agrees that Lender may, from
time to time, without notice to the Guarantor, without the Guarantor's consent,
and without affecting the Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, (i) renew,

<PAGE> 4
4

extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or otherwise
change the terms of, any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof;
(ii) take and hold security of Borrower for the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and exchange, surrender, compromise, release, enforce, waive,
release or deal with such security in any manner Lender deems necessary; (iii)
apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale as Lender in its
discretion may determine; and (iv) exercise any other rights available to it
under any of the Loan Documents.

5. Waivers by the Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby
waives, for the benefit of Lender:

(a) notices, demands, presentments, protests,
notices of protests, notices of dishonor and notices of any action (including
acceptance of this Guaranty) or inaction, notices of defaults or events of
default under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, notices of any
amendment, renewal, extension or modification of the Guaranteed Obligations or
any agreement related thereto and notices of any extension of credit to
Borrower; and

(b) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit
the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict
with the terms of this Guaranty.

6. Subrogation. The Guarantor shall not assert, enforce
or otherwise exercise (i) any right of subrogation to any of the rights of
Lender in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or (ii) any right of recourse,
reimbursement, contribution, indemnification or similar right against Borrower
on all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and the Guarantor hereby
waives any and all of the foregoing rights. The Guarantor irrevocably waives
the benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or other
security given to Lender to secure payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

7. Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor hereby
represents and warrants as follows:

7.1 No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Guaranty, will not violate any Requirement of Law or
Contractual Obligation of the Guarantor and will not result in, or require, the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any of his properties or

<PAGE> 5
5

revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation;
except to the extent such violations would not, in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

7.2 No Material Litigation. No litigation,
investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened by or
against the Borrower or against any of its properties or revenues (a) with
respect to this Guaranty, or (b) which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

7.3 Net Worth. The Guarantor has a net worth in
excess of $[CONFIDENTIAL -- REDACTED].

7.4 Investigation. The Guarantor is fully aware
of the financial condition of the Borrower and is executing and delivering this
Guaranty based solely upon the Guarantor's own independent investigation of all
matters pertinent hereto, and the Guarantor is not relying in any manner upon
any representation or statement of the Lender.

8. Bankruptcy and Related Matters. The obligations of
the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be reduced, limited, impaired,
discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any proceeding or action,
voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership,
reorganization, marshalling of assets, assignments for the benefit of creditors
or liquidation of Borrower or similar proceedings or actions or by any defense
which Borrower may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court
or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding or action. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor's liability shall
extend to all amounts and obligations that constitute the Guaranteed
Obligations and would be owed by Borrower but for the fact that they are
unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of any such proceeding or
action.

9. Reinstatement of Guaranty. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in the event that all or any portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations are paid by Borrower, the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated,
as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are
rescinded or recovered, directly or indirectly, from Lender as a preference,
fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so

<PAGE> 6
6

rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes
under this Guaranty.

10. Miscellaneous.

10.1 Rights Cumulative. The rights, powers
and remedies given to Lender by this Guaranty are cumulative and shall be in
addition to and independent of all rights, powers and remedies given to Lender
by virtue of any statute or rule of law or in any of the Loan Documents, or any
agreement between the Guarantor and Lender or between Borrower and Lender. Any
forbearance or failure to exercise, any delay by Lender in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or
remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the
further exercise of any such right, power or remedy.

10.2 Severability. In case any provision in or
obligation under this Guaranty shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

10.3 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty, or
consent to any departure by the Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be
effective without the written consent of Lender.

10.4 Applicable Law. THIS GUARANTY AND THE
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE GUARANTOR AND LENDER HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE
TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.

10.5 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY.

10.6 Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty is a
continuing guaranty and shall be binding upon the Guarantor and its successors
and assigns. This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its
respective successors and assigns. The Lender shall have the right to assign
this Guaranty or pledge its rights hereunder with the prior written consent of
the Guarantor, which consent may

<PAGE> 7
7

not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Guarantor may not assign this
Guaranty or any of the rights or obligations of the Guarantor hereunder without
the prior written consent of Lender.

10.7 No Impairment, etc. This Guaranty shall in no
event be impaired by any change which may arise by reason of the death of the
