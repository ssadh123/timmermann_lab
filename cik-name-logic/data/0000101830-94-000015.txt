SPRINT AND EDS CONFIRM DISCUSSIONS ON POSSIBLE MERGER

NEW YORK -- May 16, 1994 -- EDS and Sprint confirmed today 
they are engaged in discussions concerning the possible formation 
of a strategic relationship between the two companies. Such a 
relationship could involve a merger of equals as well as other 
types of business ventures or alliances. The parties emphasized 
that significant issues, including relative values, remain to be 
resolved and there can be no assurances that any transaction will 
be agreed upon or consummated.

Both Sprint and EDS said that a strategic relationship would 
position the companies to take advantage of significant business 
and consumer opportunities created by the convergence of 
computing, communications and services.

An alliance between the two companies would combine the 
global leader of information technology with the owner of one of 
the world's most advanced communications infrastructures. If 
combined, Sprint and EDS would have over $20 billion in annual 
revenues, significant presence and experience in major vertical 
market segments and would serve a full spectrum of customers, 
spanning individual consumers, businesses and governments.

"We have an opportunity to create a single source for 
products and services to meet the converging information and 
communications needs of customers," said Messrs. Les Alberthal, 
chairman and chief executive officer of EDS, and William T. Esrey, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint. "Our 
complementary strengths would enable us to capitalize on current 
market opportunities, and create new opportunities, as our 
industries continue to converge. A strong alliance would create 
tangible benefits for our customers, shareholders and employees in 
our rapidly changing environment," said Messrs. Alberthal and 
Esrey.

Said Mr. Alberthal: "We view Sprint's strong brand identity, 
sophisticated network and presence across a full spectrum of 
communications markets as providing us with powerful increased 
capabilities to offer our customers. In addition, Sprint's 
connection with the consumer marketplace would offer EDS an 
attractive path for the future development of products and 
services tailored to the individual."

Sprint and EDS Confirm Discussions on Possible Merger

Mr. Esrey stated: "A strategic alliance with EDS would allow 
Sprint to further enhance its already strong position in the 
business marketplace and enable it to offer even greater and more 
sophisticated information technology features."

Both companies have proven track records in managing rapid 
growth. Sprint's overall revenues have grown from $2.9 billion to 
$11.4 billion in 10 years, with its long distance business growing 
from less than $225 million to $6 billion over the same time. EDS 
has grown from $900 million in business to over $8 billion in 10 
years.

EDS is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors 
and any merger between EDS and Sprint could not occur unless 
General Motors had previously divested its ownership of EDS. In 
an announcement today, General Motors indicated its willingness, 
under certain conditions (including completion of its previously 
announced contribution of Class E stock to its pension fund) and
subject to shareholder approval, to consider a tax-free spin-off 
of EDS to the holders of GM's Class E stock, which would create an 
independent EDS owned by former Class E shareholders. In addition 
to the spin-off of EDS, a merger of equals involving EDS and 
Sprint would be subject to numerous other conditions, including 
approval by both companies' boards of directors, approval by EDS' 
post-spin-off shareholders and the shareholders of Sprint, and 
various governmental and other approvals.

Should EDS become an independent company, General Motors and 
EDS plan to enter into a new, 10-year master agreement, with 
options for renewal, under which EDS would continue to provide the 
same services for General Motors that it does today.

Sprint is a diversified international telecommunications 
company with more than $11 billion in annual revenues and the 
United States' only nationwide all-digital, fiber-optic network. 
Its divisions provide global long distance voice, data and video 
products and services, local telephone services to more than 6.2 
million subscriber lines in 19 states, and cellular operations 
that serve 42 metropolitan markets and more than 50 rural service 
areas.

EDS has operations in more than 30 countries, employs 70,000 
and is the leader in applying information technology to meet the 
needs of businesses and governments around the world. Class E 
stock is a common stock of General Motors, traded under the symbol 
GME. EDS reported revenues of $8.6 billion in 1993.
