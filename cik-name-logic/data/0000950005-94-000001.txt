FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

LANDSING PACIFIC FUND, INC. ANNOUNCES
STRATEGIC DISPOSITION PLAN AND SALE OF PROPERTY

SAN MATEO, CA -- Landsing Pacific Fund, Inc. (AMEX: LPF) today announced that at

a recent meeting, the Board of Directors determined to investigate and consider

possible courses of action for the future direction of the Fund, including the

possible sale or liquidation of the Fund or some or all of its assets, or

effecting a merger or other business combination. One course of action which

management has been authorized to undertake is to explore the disposition of its

properties in certain markets. The Fund plans to concentrate its holdings in

Northern California, Colorado and the Northwest. The markets selected for

withdrawal are those in which the Fund currently has holdings but does not

foresee a long-term presence. Those markets are St. Paul, MN, Oklahoma City,

OK, Houston, TX, and Boise, ID.

To reflect the Board action, the Fund will reduce the carrying value of certain

properties as of December 31, 1993 by making a $23.1 million provision for loss.

This provision for loss will include a write down of the value of the Multnomah

Apartment Building, in order to better reflect current estimates of the amount

which the Fund may realize from the development of the property.

The Fund also announced the sale of the Twin Oaks Executive Center in Beaverton,

Oregon on January 24, 1994. The net proceeds of the sale were approximately

$710,000. The Fund recorded a $400,000 provision for loss on the sale of the

property as of September 30, 1993.

Landsing Pacific Fund, Inc. is a self-administered real estate investment trust

with equity investments in industrial properties, shopping centers and office

buildings. It is traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "LPF".
