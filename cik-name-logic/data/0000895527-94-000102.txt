ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

a. Medium Term Notes

On December 20, 1994, a Committee of the Board of Directors
of the Registrant (the "Committee") approved the implementation
of a medium-term note program, pursuant to which the Registrant
may issue from time to time up to $1,000,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of certain medium-term notes, which may be
senior debt securities, designated as the Senior Medium-Term
Notes, Series C (the "Senior Medium-Term Notes") or subordinated
debt securities, designated as the Subordinated Medium-Term
Notes, Series C (the "Subordinated Medium-Term Notes" and,
together with the Senior Medium-Term Notes, the "Medium-Term
Notes"), or any combination thereof, establish the price, terms
and conditions and the specific method of distribution of the
Medium-Term Notes. The Senior Medium-Term Notes will be issued
under an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1992 between the
Registrant and BankAmerica National Trust Company (formerly
BankAmerica Trust Company of New York), as amended by a First
Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 1, 1993. The
Subordinated Medium-Term Notes will be issued under an Indenture
dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Registrant and The Bank
of New York, as amended, by a First Supplemental Indenture dated
as of July 1, 1993. The resolutions of the Committee are
included as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

On December 20, 1994, the Registrant entered into a
distribution agreement with the agents named therein (the
"Distribution Agreement"), the terms of which will govern sales
of the Medium- Term Notes. The Medium-Term Notes are described
generally in the Prospectus dated August 12, 1993 constituting a
part of the Registration Statement (hereinafter described), as
supplemented by a Prospectus Supplement dated December 20, 1994. 
The Distribution Agreement is included as Exhibit 99.2 hereto.

The Medium-Term Notes will be issued from time to time
pursuant to the Registrant's Registration Statement on Form S-3,
Registration No. 33-49881 (the "Registration Statement"), on a
delayed basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. The Registration Statement registered up to
$4,000,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of the
Registrant's unsecured debt securities (either senior or
subordinated), shares of its preferred stock and shares of its
common stock and was declared effective on August 12, 1993. The
Registrant previously has issued or designated for issue $3,000,000,000 
aggregate principal amount of unsecured debt securities pursuant to the 
Registration Statement.

b. Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges

The following are the consolidated ratios of earnings to fixed charges for 
the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and for each of the years in the 
five-year period ended December 31, 1993:

Nine Months
Ended
September 30, Year Ended December 31,
------------- --------------------------------
1994 1993 1992 1991 (1) 1990 1989 (2)
------------- ---- ---- -------- ---- --------

Ratio of Earnings to 
Fixed Charges:
Excluding interest 
on deposits......... 1.9 2.3 2.4 1.1 1.3 1.7
Including interest 
on deposits......... 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.0 1.1 1.2
_______________
(1) Ratios include the 1991 restructuring expense of $330 million recorded 
in connection with the merger of a subsidiary of the Registrant into 
C&S/Sovran Corporation, effective December 31, 1991. On a pro forma basis, 
excluding the 1991 restructuring expense of $330 million, the Ratio of 
Earnings to Fixed Charges excluding interest on deposits was 1.3, and the 
Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges including interest on deposits was 1.1.

(2) Includes the interest of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 
the earnings of NationsBank of Texas, National Association.

For purposes of computing the consolidated ratios, earnings represent net 
income of the Registrant plus applicable income taxes and fixed charges, 
less capitalized interest and the equity in undistributed earnings of 
unconsolidated subsidiaries and associated companies. Fixed charges 
represent interest expense (exclusive of interest on deposits in one case 
and inclusive of such interest in the other), capitalized interest, 
amortization of debt discount and appropriate issuance costs and one-third 
(the amount deemed to represent an appropriate interest factor) of net rent
expense under all lease commitments.

other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and
affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of all Securities, to
waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this
Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon
all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the
registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu
hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made
upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of
this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time,
place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of
or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or
otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the
Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any
incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or any predecessor or successor
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or
rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty
or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof
and as part of the consideration for issue hereof, expressly
waived and released.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be
registered on the registry books of the Company relating to the
Notes, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer
at the office or agency of the Company designated by it pursuant
to the Indenture, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written

of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple
thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized
denominations, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
payable in connection therewith.

such Stated Maturity Date, Redemption Date and Optional Repayment
Date being herein referred to as a "Maturity Date" with respect
to the principal repayable on such date). Interest on this Note
will accrue from the Original Issue Date specified above until
the principal amount is paid and will be computed as hereinafter
described. Interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment

Rate Reset Period with respect to this Note is daily or weekly,
interest payable on any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity

principal or interest payable with respect to such Maturity Date
will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same
force and effect as if made on such Maturity Date, and no
additional interest shall accrue for the period from and after
such Maturity Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid
or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject
to certain exceptions, be paid to the person in whose name this
Note (or one or more predecessor Notes evidencing all or a
portion of the same debt as this Note) is registered at the close

NATIONSBANK CORPORATION
MEDIUM-TERM SENIOR NOTE, SERIES C
(Floating Rate)

This Medium-Term Note is one of a duly authorized series of
Securities of the Company designated as its Senior Medium-Term
Notes, Series C (herein called the "Notes"), limited in aggregate
principal amount to $1,000,000,000, issued and to be issued under
an Indenture dated as of January 1, 1992, as amended by the First
Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of July 1, 1993 (herein
called the "Indenture"), between the Company and BankAmerica
National Trust Company (formerly BankAmerica Trust Company of New
York), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee,") to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is
hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder
of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the
terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and
delivered. The Notes may bear different dates, mature at
different times, bear interest at different rates and vary in
such other ways as are provided in the Indenture.

This Note is not subject to any sinking fund. 

This Note may be subject to repayment at the option of the
holder only if the Optional Repayment Date(s) are indicated on
the face hereof. IF NO OPTIONAL REPAYMENT DATES ARE SET FORTH ON
THE FACE HEREOF, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE SO REPAID AT THE OPTION OF
THE HOLDER HEREOF PRIOR TO THE STATED MATURITY DATE. On any
Optional Repayment Date, this Note shall be repayable in whole or
in part in increments of $1,000 at the option of the holder
hereof at a repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount
to be repaid, together with interest thereon payable to the date
of repayment. For this Note to be repaid in whole or in part at
the option of the holder hereof, this Note must be received, with
the form below entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly
completed, by the Trustee/Paying Agent at the Corporate Trust
Office, or such other address of which the Company shall from
time to time notify the holders of the Notes, not more than 60
nor less than 30 days prior to an Optional Repayment Date. 
Exercise of such repayment option by the holder hereof shall be
irrevocable.

This Note may be redeemed at the option of the Company on
any date on and after the Initial Redemption Date, if any,
specified on the face hereof (the "Redemption Date"). IF NO
INITIAL REDEMPTION DATE IS SET FORTH ON THE FACE HEREOF, THIS
NOTE MAY NOT BE REDEEMED AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO
THE STATED MATURITY DATE. On and after the Initial Redemption
Date, if any, this Note may be redeemed at any time in whole or
from time to time in part in increments of $1,000 at the option
of the Company at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined
below) together with interest thereon payable to the Redemption
Date, on notice given not more than 60 nor less than 30 days
prior to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this
Note in part only, a new Note for the unredeemed portion hereof
shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
surrender hereof.

If this Note is redeemable at the option of the Company, the
"Redemption Price" shall initially be the Initial Redemption
Percentage, specified on the face hereof, of the principal amount
of this Note to be redeemed and shall decline at each anniversary
of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption
Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof, of
the principal amount to be redeemed until the Redemption Price is
100% of such principal amount.

Accrued interest hereon shall be calculated by multiplying
the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such
accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest
factor calculated for each day from and including the Original
Issue Date, or from but excluding the last date to which interest
has been paid, as the case may be, to and including the date for
which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor
(expressed as a decimal) for each such day shall be computed by
dividing the interest rate in effect on such day by 360 or, in
the case of Notes having the Treasury Rate as their Interest Rate
Basis, by the actual number of days in the year.

Except as described below, this Note will bear interest at
the rate determined by reference to the appropriate Interest Rate
Basis and Index Maturity shown on the face hereof (i) plus or
minus the Spread, if any, or (ii) multiplied by the Spread
Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof. The interest
rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an
Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the
Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such
Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset
Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest
Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest
Reset Date, provided that (i) the interest rate in effect from
the Original Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date shall be
the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof, and (ii)
the interest rate in effect for the ten calendar days immediately
prior to the Maturity Date shall be the rate in effect on the
tenth calendar day preceding such Maturity Date. If any Interest
Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day,
such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that
is a Business Day, except that if the Interest Rate Basis
specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, if such next Business Day
is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset
Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. The term
"Final Interest Payment Period" means the period from the final
Interest Reset Date to the Maturity Date.

The Interest Determination Date with respect to any Note
that has as its Interest Rate Basis the CD Rate, Commercial Paper
Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the second
Business Day preceding the Interest Reset Date. The Interest
Determination Date with respect to LIBOR shall be the second
London Banking Day (as defined below) preceding the Interest
Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date with respect to the
Treasury Rate shall be the day of the week in which the Interest
Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof normally would be auctioned;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if as a result of a legal holiday an
auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the Interest
Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date shall be such
preceding Friday; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if an auction shall
fall on any Interest Reset Date then the Interest Reset Date
shall instead be the first Business Day following such auction.

The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest
Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar
day after such Interest Determination Date or, if such day is not
a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, or (ii) the
Business Day next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date
or Maturity Date, as the case may be.

All percentages resulting from any calculation on the Notes
will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five
one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and all
dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the
Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent
being rounded upward).

DETERMINATION OF CD RATE. CD Rate means, with respect to an
Interest Determination Date (a "CD Rate Interest Determination
Date"), the rate on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date for
negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof, as such rate is published by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve Board") in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected
Interest Rates," or any successor publication of the Federal
Reserve Board ("H.15(519)"), under the heading "CDs (Secondary
[BMarket)," or, if not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such CD Rate Interest
Determination Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such CD Rate
Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of
deposit of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in its daily
statistical release "Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations for U.S. 
Government Securities" ("Composite Quotations") under the heading
"Certificates of Deposit." If such rate is not published in
either H.15(519) or the Composite Quotations by 3:00 P.M., New
York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the CD Rate on
such CD Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by
the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the
secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 A.M., New York City
time, on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three
leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of
deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent
(after consultation with the Company) for negotiable certificates
of deposit of major United States money center banks of the
highest credit standing (in the market for negotiable
certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the
Index Maturity specified on the face hereof in denominations of
$5,000,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the dealers selected as
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth
above, the CD Rate for such CD Rate Interest Determination Date
will be the CD Rate in effect on such CD Rate Interest
Determination Date.

DETERMINATION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER RATE. The Commercial
Paper Rate means, with respect to an Interest Determination Date
(a "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date"), the
Money Market Yield (as defined below) of the rate on such date
for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the
face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the heading
"Commercial Paper." In the event such rate is not published by
3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, the
Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market Yield on such
Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date of the rate for
commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face
hereof as published in Composite Quotations under the heading
"Commercial Paper." If such rate is not published in either
H.15(519) or Composite Quotations by 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on such Calculation Date, the Commercial Paper Rate for
that Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date shall be
calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Money Market
Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00
A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest
Determination Date of three leading dealers of commercial paper
in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after
consultation with the Company) for commercial paper of the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for an industrial
issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, by a
nationally recognized statistical rating agency; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the
Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the
Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Commercial Paper Rate
Interest Determination Date will be the Commercial Paper Rate
then in effect on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest
Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" shall be the yield (expressed as a
percentage rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a
percent, with five one hundred-thousandths of a percent rounded
upward) calculated in accordance with the following formula:

Money Market Yield = [(D X 360)/(360-(DxM))]100 

where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and
"M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period
for which interest is being calculated.

DETERMINATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. The Federal Funds Rate
means, with respect to an Interest Determination Date (a "Federal
Funds Rate Interest Determination Date"), the rate on that date
for Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading
"Federal Funds (Effective)." If H.15(519) is not so published by
3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, the
Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Federal Funds Rate
Interest Determination Date as published in Composite Quotations
under the heading "Federal Funds/Effective Rate." If such rate
is not yet published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations
by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date
pertaining to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination
Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest
Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent
and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last
transaction in overnight Federal Funds as of 9:00 A.M., New York
City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date
quoted by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds
transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation
Agent (after consultation with the Company); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if fewer than three such brokers are so quoting such rates,
the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate
Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate then
in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.

DETERMINATION OF LIBOR. LIBOR means the rate determined by
the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following
provisions:

(i) With respect to an Interest Determination Date (a
"LIBOR Interest Determination Date"), LIBOR will be "LIBOR
Telerate" unless "LIBOR Reuters" is specified in the
applicable pricing supplement or LIBOR Telerate is not
available. "LIBOR Telerate" is the rate for deposits in the
LIBOR Currency (as defined below) having the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof that appears on the Designated
LIBOR Page (as defined below) specified on the face hereof
as of 11:00 A.M. London time, on that LIBOR Interest
Determination Date. "LIBOR Reuters" is that rate which is
the arithmetic mean of the offered rates (unless the
specified Designated LIBOR Page by its terms provides only
for a single rate, in which case such single rate shall be
used) for deposits in the LIBOR Currency having the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof that appear on the
Designated LIBOR Page specified on the face hereof as of
11:00 A.M. London time, on that LIBOR Interest Determination
Date, if at least two such offered rates appear (unless, as
aforesaid, only a single rate is required) on such
Designated LIBOR Page. If LIBOR cannot be determined under
this clause (i), LIBOR in respect of the related LIBOR
Interest Determination Date will be determined as if the
parties had specified the rate described in clause (ii)
below.

(ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination
Date on which LIBOR cannot be determined under clause (i)
above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal
London offices of each of four major reference banks in the
London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation
Agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide the
Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in
the LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof to prime banks in the London
interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time,
on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal
amount that is representative for a single transaction in
such LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at
least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on
such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such
quotations are provided, LIBOR for such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M. in the applicable
Principal Financial Center (as defined below), on such LIBOR
Interest Determination Date by three major banks in such
Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent
(after consultation with the Company) for loans in the LIBOR
Currency to leading European banks, having the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal
amount that is representative for a single transaction in
such LIBOR Currency in such market at such time; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the banks so selected by the Calculation
Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR
determined on such LIBOR Interest determination Date will be
LIBOR then in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination
Date.

"LIBOR Currency" means the currency (including composite
currencies) specified on the face hereof for which LIBOR shall be
calculated. If no such currency is specified on the face hereof,
the LIBOR Currency shall be U.S. dollars.

"Designated LIBOR Page" means either (a) if "LIBOR Reuters"
is specified on the face hereof, the display on the Reuters
Monitor Money Rates Service for the purpose of displaying the
London interbank rates of major banks for the applicable LIBOR
Currency, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face
hereof, the display on the Dow Jones Telerate Service for the
purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks
for the applicable LIBOR Currency. If neither LIBOR Reuters nor
LIBOR Telerate is specified on the face hereof, LIBOR for the
applicable LIBOR Currency will be determined as if LIBOR Reuters
(and, if the U.S. dollar is the LIBOR Currency, LIBO Page) had
been specified.

"Principal Financial Center" shall generally be the capital
city of the country of the specified LIBOR Currency, except that
with respect to U.S. dollars, Deutsche Marks and ECUs, the
Principal Financial Center shall be The City of New York,
Frankfurt and Luxembourg, respectively.

DETERMINATION OF PRIME RATE. Prime Rate means, with respect
to an Interest Determination Date (a "Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date"), the rate set forth on such date in
H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan," or if not so
published prior to 9:00 A.M. New York City time, on the
Calculation Date pertaining to such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be determined by the
Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of
interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the
Reuters Screen NYMF Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime
rate or base lending rates as in effect for that Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates but
more than one such rate appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page
for the Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the Prime Rate
will be determined by the Calculation Agent and will be the
arithmetic mean of the prime rates, quoted on the basis of the
actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year, as
of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date by four major money center banks in The City
of New York as selected by the Calculation Agent (after
consultation with the Company). If fewer than two such
quotations are provided, the Prime Rate shall be determined by
the Calculation Agent as of the close of business on the Prime
Rate Interest Determination Date, on the basis of the prime
rates, as of the close of business on such date, furnished in The
City of New York by the appropriate number of substitute banks or
trust companies organized and doing business under the laws of
the United States, or any State thereof, having total equity
capital of at least $500 million and being subject to supervision
or examination by Federal or State authority, selected by the
Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) to
provide such rate or rates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the banks
selected as aforesaid are not quoting as mentioned in this
sentence, the Prime Rate for such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date will be the Prime Rate then in effect on such
Prime Rate Interest Determination Date.

"Reuters Screen NYMF Page" means the display designated as
page "NYMF" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such
other page as may replace the NYMF page on that service for the
purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major
United States banks).

DETERMINATION OF TREASURY RATE. Treasury Rate means, with
respect to an Interest Determination Date (a "Treasury Rate
Interest Determination Date"), the rate for the auction held on
such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of direct
obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the
Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as published in
H.15(519) under the heading "U.S. Government Securities --
Treasury Bills -- auction average (investment)." If such rate is
not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
Calculation Date pertaining to such Treasury Rate Interest
Determination Date, the Treasury Rate will be the auction average
rate (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of
365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) on
such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date as otherwise
announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In
the event that the results of the auction of Treasury bills
having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof are not
reported as provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such
Calculation Date, or if no such auction is held on such Treasury
Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Treasury Rate for such
Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a yield to
maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year
of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis)
of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of
approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury
Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading primary United
States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation
Agent (after consultation with the Company), for the issue of
Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are
not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate with
respect to such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be
the Treasury Rate then in effect on such Treasury Rate Interest
Determination Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon
shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or
less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the
face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest
rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each
Calculation Date. The interest rate on this Note will in no
event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law,
as the same may be modified by United States law of general
application.

At the request of the holder hereof, the Calculation Agent
will provide to the holder hereof the interest rate hereon then
in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become
effective as of the next Interest Reset Date.

If an Event of Default (defined in the Indenture as (i) the
Company's failure to pay principal of (or premium, if any, on)
the Notes when due, or to pay interest on the Notes within thirty
days after the same becomes due, (ii) the Company's breach of its
other covenants contained in this Note or the Indenture, which
breach is not cured within ninety days after written notice by
the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in outstanding
principal amount of all Securities issued under the Indenture and
affected thereby, and (iii) certain events involving the
bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the Company) shall occur
with respect to the Notes, the principal of all the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the
Company with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3%
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and
all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and
affected by such amendment and modification. The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all
other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and
affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of all Securities, to
waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this
Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon
all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the
registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu
hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made
upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of
this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time,
place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of
or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or
otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the
Indenture or any indenture supplemented thereto, against any
incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or any predecessor or successor

which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference
is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights
thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the
Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be,
authenticated and delivered. The Notes may bear different dates,
mature at different times, bear interest at different rates and
vary in such other ways as are provided in the Indenture.

The Indebtedness of the Company evidenced by the Notes,
including the principal thereof and interest thereon, is, top the
extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate
and junior in right of payment to its obligations to holders of
Senior Indebtedness, as defined in the Indenture, and each holder
of the Notes, by the acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be
bound by such provisions of the Indenture.

This Note is not subject to any sinking fund. 

This Note may be subject to repayment at the option of the
holder on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, indicated on
the face hereof. If no Optional Repayment Dates are set forth on
the face hereof, this Note may not be so repaid at the option of
the holder hereof prior to the Stated Maturity Date. On any
Optional Repayment Date this Note shall be repayable in whole or
in part in increments of $1,000 at the option of the holder
hereof at a repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount
to be repaid, together with interest thereon payable to the date
of repayment. For this Note to be repaid in whole or in part at
the option of the holder hereof, this Note must be received, with
the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" below duly
completed, by the Issuing and Paying Agent at the Corporate Trust
Office, or such other address of which the Company shall from
time to time notify the holders of the Notes, not more than 60
nor less than 30 days prior to an Optional Repayment Date. 
Exercise of such repayment option by the holder hereof shall be
irrevocable.

This Note may be redeemed at the option of the Company on

of the Company at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined
below) together with interest thereon payable to the Redemption
Date, on notice given not more than 60 nor less than 30 days
prior to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this
Note in part only, a new Note for the unredeemed portion hereof
shall be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the
surrender hereof.

If this Note is redeemable at the option of the Company, the
"Redemption Price" shall initially be the Initial Redemption
Percentage, specified on the face hereof, of the principal amount
of this Note to be redeemed and shall decline at each anniversary
of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption
Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof, of
the principal amount to be redeemed until the Redemption Price is
100% of such principal amount.

If an Event of Default (defined in the Indenture as certain
events involving the bankruptcy of the Company) shall occur with
respect to the Notes, the principal of all the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Indenture. There is no right of acceleration
provided in the Indenture in case of a default in the payment of
interest or the performance of any other covenant by the Company.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the
Company with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3%
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and
all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and
affected by such amendment and modification. The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all
other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and
affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of all such
Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by
the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such
holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of
this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time,
place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of
or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or
otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the
Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any
incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or any predecessor or successor
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or
rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty
or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof
and as part of the consideration for issue hereof, expressly
waived and released.

limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be

thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized
denominations, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.

payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of
this Note, the Company, the Issuing and Paying Agent and any

MEDIUM-TERM SUBORDINATED NOTE,
SERIES C
(Floating Rate)

This Medium-Term Note is one of a duly authorized series of
Securities of the Company designated as its Subordinated Medium-
Term Notes, Series C (herein called the "Notes"), limited in
aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000, issued and to be
issued under an Indenture dated as of November 1, 1992 (herein
called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New
York, as Trustee as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture
thereto dated as of July 1, 1993 (herein called the "Trustee"),
to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto
reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights
thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the
Notes, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be,
authenticated and delivered. The Notes may bear different dates,
mature at different times, bear interest at different rates and
vary in such other ways as are provided in the Indenture.

The Indebtedness of the Company evidenced by the Notes,
including the principal thereof and interest thereon, is, top the
extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate
and junior in right of payment to its obligations to holders of
Senior Indebtedness, as defined in the Indenture, and each holder
of the Notes, by the acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be
bound by such provisions of the Indenture.

This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.

This Note may be subject to repayment at the option of the
holder only if Optional Repayment Date(s) are indicated on the
face hereof. IF NO OPTIONAL REPAYMENT DATES ARE SET FORTH ON THE
FACE HEREOF, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE SO REPAID AT THE OPTION OF THE
HOLDER HEREOF PRIOR TO THE STATED MATURITY DATE. On any Optional
Repayment Date, this Note shall be repayable in whole or in part
in increments of $1,000 at the option of the holder hereof at a
repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be
repaid, together with interest thereon payable to the date of
repayment. For this Note to be repaid in whole or in part at the
option of the holder hereof, this Note must be received, with the
form below entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed,
by the Issuing and Paying Agent at the Corporate Trust Office, or
such other address of which the Company shall from time to time
notify the holders of the Notes, not more than 60 nor less than
30 days prior to an Optional Repayment Date. Exercise of such
repayment option by the holder hereof shall be irrevocable.

This Note may be redeemed at the option of the Company on
any date on and after the Initial Redemption Date, if any,
specified on the face hereof (the "Redemption Date"). IF NO
INITIAL REDEMPTION DATE IS SET FORTH ON THE FACE HEREOF, THIS
NOTE MAY NOT BE REDEEMED AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY PRIOR TO
THE STATED MATURITY DATE. On and after the Initial Redemption
Date, if any, this Note may be redeemed at any time in whole or
from time to time in part in increments of $1,000 at the option
of the Company at the applicable Redemption Price (as defined
below) together with interest thereon payable to the Redemption
Date, on notice given not more than 60 nor less than 30 days
prior to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this
Note in part only, a new Note for the unredeemed portion hereof
shall be issued in the name of the [Holder] hereof upon the
surrender hereof.

If this Note is redeemable at the option of the Company, the
"Redemption Price" shall initially be the Initial Redemption
Percentage, specified on the face hereof, of the principal amount
of this Note to be redeemed and shall decline at each anniversary
of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption
Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof, of
the principal amount to be redeemed until the Redemption Price is
100% of such principal amount.

Accrued interest hereon shall be calculated by multiplying
the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such
accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest
factor calculated for each day from and including Original Issue
Date, or from but excluding the last date to which interest has
been paid, as the case may be, to and including the date for
which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor
(expressed as a decimal) for each such day shall be computed by
dividing the interest rate in effect on such day by 360 or, in
the case of Notes having the Treasury Rate as their Interest Rate
Basis, by the actual number of days in the year.

Except as described below, this Note will bear interest at
the rate determined by reference to the appropriate Interest Rate
Basis and Index Maturity shown on the face hereof (i) plus or
minus the Spread, if any, or (ii) multiplied by the Spread
Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof. The interest
rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an
Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the
Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such
Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset
Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest
Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest
Reset Date, provided that (i) the interest rate in effect from
the Original Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date shall be
the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof, and (ii)
the interest rate in effect for the ten calendar days immediately
prior to the Maturity Date shall be the rate in effect on the
tenth calendar day preceding such Maturity Date. If any Interest
Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day,
such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that
is a Business Day, except that if the Interest Rate Basis
specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, if such next Business Day
is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset
Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. The term
"Final Interest Payment Period" means the period from the final
Interest Reset Date to the Maturity Date.

The Interest Determination Date with respect to any Note
that has as its Interest Rate Basis the CD Rate, Commercial Paper
Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the second
Business Day preceding the Interest Reset Date. The Interest
Determination Date with respect to LIBOR shall be the second
London Banking Day (as defined below) preceding the Interest
Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date with respect to the
Treasury Rate shall be the day of the week in which the Interest
Reset Date falls on which Treasury bills of the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof normally would be auctioned;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if as a result of a legal holiday an
auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the Interest
Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date shall be such
preceding Friday; [and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if an auction
shall fall on any Interest Reset Date then the Interest Reset
Date shall instead be the first Business Day following such
auction.]

The "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest
Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar
day after such Interest Determination Date or, if such day is not
a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, or (ii) the
Business Day next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date
or Maturity Date, as the case may be.

All percentages resulting from any calculation on the Notes
will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five
one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and all
dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on the
Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent
being rounded upward).

DETERMINATION OF CD RATE. CD Rate means, with respect to an
Interest Determination Date (a "CD Rate Interest Determination
Date"), the rate on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date for
negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof, as such rate is published by the

Reserve Board") in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected
Interest Rates," or any successor publication of the Federal
Reserve Board ("H.15(519)"), under the heading "CDs (Secondary
Market)," or, if not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such CD Rate Interest
Determination Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such CD Rate
Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of
deposit of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in its daily
statistical release "Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations for U.S. 
Government Securities" ("Composite Quotations") under the heading
"Certificates of Deposit." If such rate is not published in
either H.15(519) or the Composite Quotations by 3:00 P.M., New
York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the CD Rate on
such CD Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by
the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the
secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 A.M., New York City
time, on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three
leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of
deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent
(after consultation with the Company) for negotiable certificates
of deposit of major United States money center banks of the
highest credit standing (in the market for negotiable
certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the
Index Maturity specified on the face hereof in denominations of
$5,000,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the dealers selected as
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth
above, the CD Rate for such CD Rate Interest Determination Date
will be the CD Rate in effect on such CD Rate Interest
Determination Date.

DETERMINATION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER RATE. The Commercial
Paper Rate means, with respect to an Interest Determination Date
(a "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date"), the
Money Market Yield (as defined below) of the rate on such date
for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the
face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the heading
"Commercial Paper." In the event such rate is not published by
3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date, the
Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market Yield on such
Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date of the rate for
commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face
hereof as published in Composite Quotations under the heading
"Commercial Paper." If such rate is not published in either
H.15(519) or Composite Quotations by 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on such Calculation Date, the Commercial Paper Rate for
that Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date shall be
calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Money Market
Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00
A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest
Determination Date of three leading dealers of commercial paper
in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after
consultation with the Company) for commercial paper of the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for an industrial
issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, by a
nationally recognized statistical rating agency; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the
Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, the
Commercial Paper Rate with respect to such Commercial Paper Rate
Interest Determination Date will be the Commercial Paper Rate
then in effect on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest
Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" shall be the yield (expressed as a
percentage rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a
percent, with five one hundred-thousandths of a percent rounded
upward) calculated in accordance with the following formula:

D X 360 
Money Market Yield = ___________________________
360 - (D x M) x 100

where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and
"M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period
for which interest is being calculated.

DETERMINATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. The Federal Funds Rate
means, with respect to an Interest Determination Date (a "Federal
Funds Rate Interest Determination Date"), the rate on that date
for Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading
"Federal Funds (Effective)." If H.15(519) is not so published by
3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, the
Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Federal Funds Rate
Interest Determination Date as published in Composite Quotations
under the heading "Federal Funds/Effective Rate." If such rate
is not yet published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations
by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date
pertaining to such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination
Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such Federal Funds Rate Interest
Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent
and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last
transaction in overnight Federal Funds as of 9:00 A.M., New York
City time, on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date
quoted by each of three leading brokers of Federal Funds
transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation
Agent (after consultation with the Company); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if fewer than three such brokers are so quoting such rates,
the Federal Funds Rate with respect to such Federal Funds Rate
Interest Determination Date will be the Federal Funds Rate then
in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date.

DETERMINATION OF LIBOR. LIBOR means the rate determined by
the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following
provisions:

(i) With respect to an Interest Determination Date (a
"LIBOR Interest Determination Date"), LIBOR will be "LIBOR
Telerate" unless "LIBOR Reuters" is specified in the
applicable pricing supplement or LIBOR Telerate is not
available. "LIBOR Telerate" is the rate for deposits in the
LIBOR Currency (as defined below) having the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof that appears on the Designated
LIBOR Page (as defined below) specified on the face hereof
as of 11:00 A.M. London time, on that LIBOR Interest
Determination Date. "LIBOR Reuters" is that rate which is
the arithmetic mean of the offered rates (unless the
specified Designated LIBOR Page by its terms provides only
for a single rate, in which case such single rate shall be
used) for deposits in the LIBOR Currency having the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof that appear on the
Designated LIBOR Page specified on the face hereof as of
11:00 A.M. London time, on that LIBOR Interest Determination
Date, if at least two such offered rates appear (unless, as
aforesaid, only a single rate is required) on such
Designated LIBOR Page. If LIBOR cannot be determined under
this clause (i), LIBOR in respect of the related LIBOR
Interest Determination Date will be determined as if the
parties had specified the rate described in clause (ii)
below.

(ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination
Date on which LIBOR cannot be determined under clause (i)
above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal
London offices of each of four major reference banks in the
London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation
Agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide the
Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in
the LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof to prime banks in the London
interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time,
on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal
amount that is representative for a single transaction in
such LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at
least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on
such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such
quotations are provided, LIBOR for such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M. in the applicable
Principal Financial Center (as defined below), on such LIBOR
Interest Determination Date by three major banks in such
Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent
(after consultation with the Company) for loans in the LIBOR
Currency to leading European banks, having the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof and in a principal
amount that is representative for a single transaction in
such LIBOR Currency in such market at such time; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the banks so selected by the Calculation
Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR
determined on such LIBOR Interest determination Date will be
LIBOR then in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination
Date.

"LIBOR Currency" means the currency (including composite
currencies) specified on the face hereof for which LIBOR shall be
calculated. If no such currency is specified on the face hereof,
the LIBOR Currency shall be U.S. dollars.

"Designated LIBOR Page" means either (a) if "LIBOR Reuters"
is specified on the face hereof, the display on the Reuters
Monitor Money Rates Service for the purpose of displaying the
London interbank rates of major banks for the applicable LIBOR
Currency, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face
hereof, the display on the Dow Jones Telerate Service for the
purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks
for the applicable LIBOR Currency. If neither LIBOR Reuters nor
LIBOR Telerate is specified on the face hereof, LIBOR for the
applicable LIBOR Currency will be determined as if LIBOR Reuters
(and, if the U.S. dollar is the LIBOR Currency, LIBO Page) had
been specified.

"Principal Financial Center" shall generally be the capital
city of the country of the specified LIBOR Currency, except that
with respect to U.S. dollars, Deutsche Marks and ECUs, the
Principal Financial Center shall be The City of New York,
Frankfurt and Luxembourg, respectively.

DETERMINATION OF PRIME RATE. Prime Rate means, with respect
to an Interest Determination Date (a "Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date"), the rate set forth on such date in
H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan," or if not so
published prior to 9:00 A.M. New York City time, on the
Calculation Date pertaining to such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be determined by the
Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of
interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the
Reuters Screen NYMF Page (as defined below) as such bank's prime
rate or base lending rates as in effect for that Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates but
more than one such rate appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page
for the Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the Prime Rate
will be determined by the Calculation Agent and will be the
arithmetic mean of the prime rates, quoted on the basis of the
actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year, as
of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date by four major money center banks in The City
of New York as selected by the Calculation Agent (after
consultation with the Company). If fewer than two such
quotations are provided, the Prime Rate shall be determined by
the Calculation Agent as of the close of business on the Prime
Rate Interest Determination Date, on the basis of the prime
rates, as of the close of business on such date, furnished in The
City of New York by the appropriate number of substitute banks or
trust companies organized and doing business under the laws of
the United States, or any State thereof, having total equity
capital of at least $500 million and being subject to supervision
or examination by Federal or State authority, selected by the
Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) to
provide such rate or rates; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the banks
selected as aforesaid are not quoting as mentioned in this
sentence, the Prime Rate for such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date will be the Prime Rate then in effect on such
Prime Rate Interest Determination Date.

"Reuters Screen NYMF Page" means the display designated as
page "NYMF" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such
other page as may replace the NYMF page on that service for the
purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major
United States banks).

DETERMINATION OF TREASURY RATE. Treasury Rate means, with
respect to an Interest Determination Date (a "Treasury Rate
Interest Determination Date"), the rate for the auction held on
such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of direct
obligations of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the
Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as published in
H.15(519) under the heading "U.S. Government Securities --
Treasury Bills -- auction average (investment)." If such rate is
not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
Calculation Date pertaining to such Treasury Rate Interest
Determination Date, the Treasury Rate will be the auction average
rate (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of
365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) on
such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date as otherwise
announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In
the event that the results of the auction of Treasury bills
having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof are not
reported as provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such
Calculation Date, or if no such auction is held on such Treasury
Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Treasury Rate for such
Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a yield to
maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year
of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis)
of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of
approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury
Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading primary United
States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation
Agent (after consultation with the Company), for the issue of
Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are
not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate with
respect to such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be
the Treasury Rate then in effect on such Treasury Rate Interest
Determination Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon
shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or
less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the
face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest
rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each
Calculation Date. The interest rate on this Note will in no
event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law,
as the same may be modified by United States law of general
application.

At the request of the holder hereof, the Calculation Agent
will provide to the holder hereof the interest rate hereon then
in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become
effective as of the next Interest Reset Date.

If an Event of Default (defined in the Indenture as certain
events involving the bankruptcy of the Company) shall occur with
respect to the Notes, the principal of all the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Indenture. There is no right of acceleration
provided in the Indenture in case of a default in the payment of
interest or the performance of any other covenant by the Company.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the
Company with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3%
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and
all other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and
affected by such amendment and modification. The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all
other Securities then outstanding under the Indenture and
affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of all such
Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by
the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such
holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of
this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time,
place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of
or the interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or
otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the
Indenture or any indenture supplemented thereto, against any
incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or any predecessor or successor
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or
rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty
or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof
and as part of the consideration for issue hereof, expressly
waived and released.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be
registered on the registry books of the Company relating to the
Notes, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer
at the office or agency of the Company designated by it pursuant

instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and
the Trustee duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes,
of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Notes are issuable only as registered Notes without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple
thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized
denominations, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of
this Note, the Company, the Issuing and Paying Agent and any

December 20, 1994
To the Agents listed on 
Exhibit A hereto and to
each additional person 
that shall become an Agent 
as provided in Section 12
of this Agreement.

Dear Sirs:

NationsBank Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (the
"Company"), confirms its agreement with each of you
(individually, as "Agent" and collectively, the "Agents") with
respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Senior
Medium-Term Notes, Series C (the "Senior Notes") and its
Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series C (the "Subordinated

Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of July 1, 1993 (as so
amended, the "Senior Indenture"), and resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation (or a committee thereof). The
Subordinated Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture
dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of
New York, as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee"), as amended by
the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of July 1, 1993
(as so amended, the "Subordinated Indenture), and resolutions of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (or a committee
thereof). The Senior Trustee and the Subordinated Trustee are
collectively referred to herein as the "Trustees," and the Senior
Indenture and the Subordinated Indenture are collectively
referred to herein as the "Indentures."

This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the
Company to one or more of the Agents as principal for resale to
purchasers and (as may from time to time be agreed to by the
Company and the Agent or Agents) directly to purchasers, in which
case the Agent or Agents may act as an agent of the Company in
soliciting Note purchases.

The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No.
33-49881) for the registration of debt securities (both senior
and subordinated), preferred shares and common shares under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the
offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of
the rules and regulations of the SEC under the 1933 Act (the
"1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been
declared effective by the SEC, and the Trustees have been
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
"1939 Act"). Such registration statement (and any further
registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the
purpose of registering additional Notes and in connection with
which this Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as
an exhibit) and the prospectus constituting a part thereof, and
any prospectus supplements relating to the Notes, including all
documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time
amended or supplemented by the filing of documents pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"),
or the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as the
"Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus," respectively,
except that if any revised prospectus shall be provided to the
Agent by the Company for use in connection with the offering of
the Notes which is not required to be filed by the Company
pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, the term
"Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus from and
after the time it is first provided to the Agent for such use.

SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT AS AGENT.

(a) APPOINTMENT. Subject to the terms and conditions
stated herein including the reservation by the Company of the
right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf as set forth in
Section 3(c) hereof, the Company hereby appoints the Agents as
its agents for the sale of the Notes and agrees that Notes will
be sold exclusively to or through the Agents. The Agents are
authorized to engage the services of any other broker or dealer
in connection with the offer or sale of the Notes purchased by an
Agent as principal for resale to others, but are not authorized
to appoint sub-agents in connection with the sale of Notes
through an Agent as agent.

(b) SALE OF NOTES. The Company shall not sell or approve
the solicitation of purchases of Notes in excess of the amount
which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time or in
excess of the principal amount of Notes registered pursuant to
the Registration Statement. The Agents will have no
responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the
aggregate principal amount of Notes sold, or otherwise monitoring
the availability of Notes for sale under the Registration
Statement.

(c) PURCHASES AS PRINCIPAL. The Agents shall not have any
obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but
an Agent and the Company may agree from time to time that such
Agent shall purchase Notes as principal. Any such purchase of
Notes by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with
Section 3(a) hereof.

(d) SOLICITATIONS AS AGENT. If agreed upon by an Agent and
the Company, the Agent, acting solely as agent for the Company
and not as principal, will solicit purchases of the Notes. Such
Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer to
purchase Notes solicited by such Agent on an agency basis, other
than those offers rejected by the Agent. The Agent shall have
the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any
proposed purchase of Notes by persons solicited by the Agent, as
a whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a
breach of the Agent's agreement contained herein. The Company
may accept or reject any proposed purchase of the Notes, in whole
or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach
of the Company's agreement herein. The Agent shall make
reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance
by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been
solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company. The Agent
shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such
agency purchase is not consummated for any reason other than the
negligence of the Agent. If the Company shall default on its
obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has
accepted, the Company shall (i) hold the Agent for such purchase
harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a
result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding
such default, pay to such Agent any commission to which it would
be entitled in connection with such sale.

(e) RELIANCE. The Company and the Agents agree that any
Notes the placement of which an Agent arranges shall be placed by
such Agent, and any Notes purchased by such Agent shall be
purchased, in reliance on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on
the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.

SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

(a) The Company represents and warrants to the Agents as of
the date hereof, as of the date of each acceptance by the Company
of an offer for the purchase of Notes (whether through an Agent
as agent or to an Agent as principal), as of the date of each
delivery of Notes (whether through an Agent as agent or to an
Agent as principal) (the date of each such delivery to an Agent
as principal being hereafter referred to as a "Settlement Date"),
and as of any time that the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented or there is filed
with the SEC any document incorporated by reference into the
Prospectus (other than any Current Report on Form 8-K relating
exclusively to the issuance of debt securities under the
Registration Statement) (each of the times referenced above being
referred to herein as a "Representation Date") as follows: 

(i) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form
S-3 under the 1933 Act and has filed with the SEC the
Registration Statement, which has become effective. Such
Registration Statement meets the requirements of Rule
415(a)(1) under the 1933 Act and complies in all other
material respects with said Rule.

(ii) As of the date hereof, when the Prospectus as
supplemented with respect to the Notes is first filed
pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, when any amendment
to the Registration Statement becomes effective (including
the filing of any document incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement) and as of the applicable
Representation Date, (a) the Registration Statement, as
amended or supplemented as of any such time, the Prospectus,
when filed, and the applicable Indenture will comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the
1933 Act, the 1939 Act and the 1934 Act and the respective
rules thereunder, (b) the Registration Statement, as amended
as of any such time, will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading, and (c) the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company
makes no representations or warranties as to (x) that part
of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the
Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee
(Form T-1) under the 1939 Act of either of the Trustees or
(y) the information contained in or omitted from the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Company by or on behalf of any Agent specifically for use in
connection with the preparation of the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus.

(iii) The Company has complied and will comply with all
the provisions of Florida H.B. 1771, codified as Section
517.075 of the Florida Statutes, 1987, as amended, and all
regulations promulgated thereunder relating to issuers doing
business in Cuba; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that
such Section 517.075 shall be repealed, or amended such that
issuers shall no longer be required to disclose in
prospectuses information regarding business activities in
Cuba or that a broker, dealer or agent shall no longer be
required to obtain a statement from issuers regarding such
compliance, then this representation and agreement shall be
of no further force and effect.

(b) ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATIONS. Any certificate signed by
any director or officer of the Company and delivered to an Agent
or to counsel for such Agent in connection with an offering of
Notes or the sale of Notes to an Agent as principal shall be
deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to such Agent
as to the matters covered thereby on the date of such certificate
and at each Representation Date subsequent thereto.

SECTION 3. PURCHASES AS PRINCIPAL; SOLICITATIONS AS AGENT. 

(a) PURCHASES AS PRINCIPAL. Unless otherwise agreed by an
Agent and the Company, Notes shall be purchased by such Agent as
principal. Each purchase of Notes, unless otherwise agreed,
shall be at a discount equivalent to the applicable commissions
set forth in Exhibit C hereto. Such purchases shall be made in
accordance with terms agreed upon by the Agent and the Company
(which shall be agreed upon orally, with written confirmation
prepared by the Agent and delivered to the Company within two
business days of such oral agreement). The Agent's commitment to
purchase Notes as principal shall be deemed to have been made on
the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company
herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions
herein set forth. An Agent may engage the services of any other
broker or dealer in connection with the resale of the Notes
purchased as principal and may reallow any portion of the
discount received in connection with such purchases from the
Company to such brokers and dealers.

(b) SOLICITATIONS AS AGENT. On the basis of the
representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to
the terms and conditions herein set forth, when agreed by the
Company and an Agent, such Agent, as an agent of the Company,
will use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase the
Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the
Prospectus. All Notes sold through an Agent as agent will be
sold at 100% of their principal amount unless otherwise agreed to
by the Company and such Agent.

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
suspend solicitation of purchases of the Notes through the
Agents, as agent, commencing at any time for any period of time
or permanently. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company,
the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of purchases from
the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Agents
that such solicitation may be resumed.

The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, in the
form of a discount, equal to the applicable percentage of the
principal amount of each Note sold by the Company as a result of
a solicitation made by such Agent as set forth in Exhibit C
hereto. 
(c) COMPANY SALES TO UNSOLICITED PURCHASERS. 
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company
reserves the right to sell Notes, at any time, directly on its
own behalf to any unsolicited purchaser, whether directly to such
purchaser or through the agent of such purchaser. Upon the sale
of any Notes to an unsolicited purchaser, no Agent shall be
entitled to any commission pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. The purchase price,
interest rate, maturity date and other terms of the Notes (as
applicable) specified in Exhibit B hereto shall be agreed upon by

that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light
of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is
delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the
reasonable opinion of either such counsel, to amend or supplement

The obligations of an Agent to solicit offers to purchase

certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the
performance and observance by the Company of all its covenants
and agreements herein contained and to the following additional
conditions precedent:

(a) LEGAL OPINIONS. On the date hereof, the Agents shall
have received the following legal opinions, dated as of the date
hereof and in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents:

(1) OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL. The opinion of Smith
Helms Mulliss & Moore, L.L.P., counsel to the Company, to
the effect of paragraphs (i) and (iv) through (x) below, and
the opinion of Paul J. Polking, Executive Vice President and
General Counsel to the Company, to the effect of paragraphs

(i) The Company is a duly organized and validly
existing corporation in good standing under the laws of
the State of North Carolina, has the corporate power
and authority to own its properties and conduct its
business as described in the Prospectus and is duly
registered as a bank holding company under the Bank

required to be qualified or licensed to do business as
a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction. 

(iii) All the outstanding shares of capital stock
of each Subsidiary have been duly and validly
authorized and issued and are fully paid and (except as
provided in 12 U.S.C. Section 55, as amended)
nonassessable, and, except as otherwise set forth in
the Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Subsidiaries (except directors' qualifying
shares) are owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company free and clear of any perfected security
interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, after
due inquiry, any other security interests, claims,
liens or encumbrances.

(iv) This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors now or hereafter in
effect, and to equitable principles that may limit the
right to specific enforcement of remedies, and except
insofar as the enforceability of the indemnity and
contribution provisions contained in this Agreement may
be limited by federal and state securities laws, and
further subject to 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(b)(6)(D) and
similar bank regulatory powers and to the application
of principles of public policy underlying all such
laws).

(v) Each of the Indentures has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered, has been duly
qualified under the 1939 Act, as applicable, and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, and the Notes have been duly authorized and,
when the terms of the Medium-Term Notes have been
established and when the Medium-Term Notes have been
completed, executed, authenticated and delivered in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable
Indenture, the applicable Board Resolution and this
Agreement against payment of the consideration
therefor, will constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of
such Indenture, subject (with respect to each of the
Indentures and the Notes) as to enforcement of
remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors now or
hereafter in effect, and to equitable principles that
may limit the right to specific enforcement of
remedies, and further subject to 12 U.S.C. Section
1818(b)(6)(D) and similar bank regulatory powers and to
the application of principles of public policy
underlying all such laws.

(vi) The forms of Notes attached to the
Secretary's Certificate delivered to the Agents conform
in all material respects to the description thereof
contained in the Prospectus, as supplemented or
amended.

(vii) The Registration Statement has become
effective under the 1933 Act; to the best knowledge of
such counsel no stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement has been issued and no
proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or
threatened; the Registration Statement, the Prospectus
and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto (other
than the financial statements and other financial and
statistical information contained therein or
incorporated by reference therein, as to which such
counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the respective
rules thereunder.

(viii) To the best knowledge of such counsel, except
as disclosed in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, there is no pending or threatened action,
suit or proceeding before or by any court or
governmental agency, authority or body or any
arbitrator involving the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, of a character required to be disclosed
in the Registration Statement, which is not adequately
disclosed in the Prospectus, and there is no franchise,
contract or other document of a character required to
be described in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit, which is not
described or filed as required. 

(ix) To the best knowledge of such counsel,
neither the issuance and sale of the Notes, the
consummation of any other of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement nor the fulfillment of
the terms thereof will conflict with, result in a
breach of, or constitute a default under the Restated
Articles of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company or, to the best of such counsel's
knowledge, the terms of any material indenture or other
agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to
which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party
or bound, or any order or regulation known to such
counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator
having jurisdiction over the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries. 

(x) To the best knowledge of such counsel, no
authorization, order, approval or consent of, or filing
with, any court or governmental authority or agency is
necessary or required in connection with the sale of
the Notes hereunder, except such as have been obtained
under the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations and such
as may be required under foreign or state securities or
insurance laws in connection with the distribution of
the Notes.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A)
as to matters involving the application of laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of North Carolina or the
United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in
such opinion, upon counsel for the Agents or upon the
opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be
reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Agents;
and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper,
on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and
the Subsidiaries and public officials.

Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, counsel to the Agents, covering
the matters referred to in subparagraph (1) under the
subheadings (iv) through (vii), inclusive, above. 

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as
to matters involving the application of laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York or the United
States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in such
opinion, upon counsel for the Company or upon the opinion of
other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and
who are satisfactory to counsel for the Company; and (B) as
to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on
certificates of responsible officers of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and public officials.

(3) In giving their opinions required by subsections
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this Section, but without opining in
connection therewith, Smith Helms Mulliss & Moore, L.L.P.
and Stroock & Stroock & Lavan shall each additionally state
that although they have not independently verified, are not
passing upon and assume no responsibility for, the accuracy,
completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the
Registration Statement, such counsel has no reason to
believe that the Registration Statement or any amendment
thereof at the time it became effective, or that the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE. At the date hereof, the Agents
shall have received a certificate of the Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Vice President and the
chief financial or chief accounting officer of the Company, dated
as of the date hereof, to the effect that the signers of such
certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus and this Agreement and that to the best of their
knowledge (i) since the respective dates as of which information
is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there
has not been any material adverse change in the condition,
financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or
business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered
as one enterprise, whether or not arising from transactions in
the ordinary course of business, except as set forth or
contemplated in the Prospectus, as supplemented or amended, (ii)
the other representations and warranties of the Company contained
in Section 2 hereof are true and correct in all material respects
with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as
of the date of such certificate, (iii) the Company has performed
or complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on
its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the date of
such certificate, and (iv) that no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and
no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or
threatened by the SEC.

(c) COMFORT LETTER. On the date hereof, the Agents shall
have received a letter from Price Waterhouse LLP ("Price
Waterhouse") dated as of the date hereof and in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect that:

(i) They are independent public accountants with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the
meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.

(ii) In their opinion, the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries audited by
them and included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations
with respect to registration statements on Form S-3 and the
1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.

(iii) On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards)
consisting of:

(a) Reading the minutes of the meetings of the
shareholders, the board of directors, executive
committee and audit committee of the Company and the
boards of directors and executive committees of its
subsidiaries as set forth in the minute books through a
specified date not more than five business days prior

(b) Performing the procedures specified by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
a review of interim financial information as described

the Registration Statement and Prospectus and reading
the unaudited interim financial data, if any, for the
period from the date of the latest balance sheet
included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus to the date of
the latest available interim financial data; and

(c) Making inquiries of certain officials of the
Company who have responsibility for financial and
accounting matters regarding the specific items for
which representations are requested below;

nothing has come to their attention as a result of the
foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that:

(1) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements, included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus,
do not comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act
and the published rules and regulations thereunder;

(2) any material modifications should be made to
the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements, included or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement and Prospectus, for them to
be in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles;

(3) (i) at the date of the latest available
interim financial data and at the specified date not
more than five business days prior to the date of the
delivery of such letter, there was any change in the
capital stock or the long-term debt (other than
scheduled repayments of such debt) or any decreases in
shareholders' equity of the Company and the
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as compared with
the amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included
or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus or (ii) for the period
from the date of the latest available financial data to
a specified date not more than five business days prior
to the delivery of such letter, there was any change in
the capital stock or the long-term debt (other than
scheduled repayments of such debt) or any decreases in
shareholders' equity of the Company and the
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except in all
instances for changes or decreases which the
Registration Statement and Prospectus discloses have
occurred or may occur, or Price Waterhouse shall state
any specific changes or decreases.

(iv) The letter shall also state that Price
Waterhouse has carried out certain other specified
procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to
certain amounts, percentages and financial information
which are included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus and which are
specified by the Agents and agreed to by Price
Waterhouse, and has found such amounts, percentages and
financial information to be in agreement with the
relevant accounting, financial and other records of the
Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.

(d) OTHER DOCUMENTS. On the date hereof and on each
Settlement Date with respect to any purchase of Notes by an Agent
as principal, counsel to the Agents shall have been furnished
with such documents and opinions as such counsel may reasonably
require for the purpose of enabling such counsel to pass upon the
issuance and sale of Notes as herein contemplated and related
proceedings, or in order to evidence the accuracy and
completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the
fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all
proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance
and sale of Notes as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in
form and substance to such Agent and to counsel to the Agents.

If any condition specified in this Section 5 shall not have
been fulfilled in all material respects when and as required to
be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Agents by
notice to the Company at any time and any such termination shall
be without liability of any party to any other party, except that
the covenant regarding provision of an earnings statement set
forth in Section 4(h) hereof, the provisions concerning payment
of expenses under Section 9 hereof, the indemnity and
contribution agreements set forth in Section 8 hereof, the
provisions concerning the representations, warranties and
agreements to survive delivery set forth in Section 10 hereof and
the provisions regarding parties set forth under Section 15
hereof shall remain in effect.

SECTION 6. DELIVERY OF AND PAYMENT FOR NOTES SOLD THROUGH THE
AGENTS.

Delivery of Notes sold through an Agent as agent shall be
made by the Company to such Agent for the account of any
purchaser only against payment therefor in immediately available
funds. In the event that a purchaser shall fail either to accept
delivery of or to make payment for a Note on the date fixed for
settlement, the Agent shall promptly notify the Company and
deliver the Note to the Company, and, if the Agent has
theretofore paid the Company for such Note, the Company will
promptly return such funds to the Agent. If such failure
occurred for any reason other than default by the Agent in the
performance of its obligations hereunder, the Company will
reimburse the Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use
of the funds for the period such funds were credited to the
Company's account. Unless otherwise agreed between the Company
and the Agent, all Notes will be issued in book-entry only form
and will be represented by one or more fully registered global
securities.

SECTION 7. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.

The Company covenants and agrees with the Agents that:

(a) REAFFIRMATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each
acceptance by it of an offer for the purchase of Notes, and each
delivery of Notes to an Agent pursuant to a sale of Notes to such
Agent as principal, shall be deemed to be an affirmation that the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate theretofore delivered to such
Agent pursuant hereto are true and correct at the time of such
acceptance or sale, as the case may be, and an undertaking that
such representations and warranties will be true and correct at
the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent, or to such
Agent, of the Note or Notes relating to such acceptance or sale,
as the case may be, as though made at and as of each such time
(and it is understood that such representations and warranties
shall relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectus as
amended and supplemented to each such time).

(b) SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY OF CERTIFICATES. Each time that
(i) there is filed with the SEC any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
or Annual Report on Form 10-K that is incorporated by reference
into the Prospectus, or (ii) if required by the Agents, the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or
supplemented (other than by an amendment or supplement providing
solely for a change in the interest rates or maturity dates of
Notes or similar changes, an amendment or supplement which
relates exclusively to an offering of securities other than the
Notes or, except as hereinbefore described, an amendment or
supplement resulting from the filing of any document incorporated
by reference therein), the Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Agents forthwith a certificate of the Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, any Senior Vice
President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Accounting
Officer or Treasurer of the Company dated the date of filing with

satisfactory to the Agents to the effect that the statements
contained in the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) hereof
which was last furnished to the Agents are true and correct at
the time of such filing, amendment or supplement, as the case may
be, as though made at and as of such time (except that such
statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to such
time) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same
tenor as the certificate referred to in said Section 5(b),
modified as necessary to relate to the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of
delivery of such certificate.

(c) SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY OF LEGAL OPINIONS. Each time that
(i) there is filed with the SEC any Annual Report on Form 10-K,
(ii) if required by the Agents, there is filed any Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, or (iii) if required by the Agents, the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or
supplemented (other than by an amendment or supplement providing
solely for a change in the interest rates or maturity dates of
the Notes or similar changes or solely for the inclusion of
additional financial information, an amendment or supplement
which relates exclusively to an offering of securities other than
the Notes or, except as hereinbefore described, an amendment or
supplement resulting from the filing of any document incorporated
by reference therein), the Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished forthwith to the Agents and to counsel to the Agents
the written opinions of Smith Helms Mulliss & Moore, L.L.P.,
Counsel to the Company, and Paul J. Polking, General Counsel to
the Company, or other counsel satisfactory to the Agents, dated
the date of filing with the SEC of such supplement or document or
the date of effectiveness of such amendment, as the case may be,
in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, of the same
tenor as the opinions referred to in Section 5(a)(1) hereof, but
modified, as necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of
delivery of such opinions; or, in lieu of such opinions, counsel
last furnishing such opinions to the Agents shall furnish the
Agents with a letter substantially to the effect that the Agents
may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it was
dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that
statements in such last opinion shall be deemed to relate to the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and
supplemented to the time of delivery of such letter authorizing
reliance).

(d) SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY OF COMFORT LETTERS. Each time that
(i) there is filed with the SEC any Annual Report on Form 10-K,
(ii) if required by the Agents, there is filed with the SEC any
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or (iii) if required by the Agents,
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or
supplemented to include additional financial information (other
than an amendment or supplement resulting from the filing of a
Current Report on Form 8-K that is incorporated by reference
therein), the Company shall cause Price Waterhouse forthwith to
furnish the Agents a letter, dated the date of effectiveness of
such amendment, supplement or document filed with the SEC, as the
case may be, in form satisfactory to the Agents, of the same
tenor as the portions of the letter referred to in clauses (i)
and (ii) of Section 5(c) hereof but modified to relate to the
Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended and
supplemented to the date of such letter, and of the same general
tenor as the portions of the letter referred to in clauses (iii)
and (iv) of said Section 5(c) with such changes as may be
necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and
other information derived from the accounting records of the
Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus is amended or supplemented solely to include
financial information as of and for a fiscal quarter, Price
Waterhouse may limit the scope of such letter to the unaudited
financial statements included in such amendment or supplement. 
If any other information included therein is of an accounting,
financial or statistical nature, the Agents may request
procedures be performed with respect to such other information. 
If Price Waterhouse is willing to perform and report on the
requested procedures, such letter should cover such other
information. Any letter required to be provided by Price
Waterhouse hereunder shall be provided within five business days
of the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K or, with respect
to any letter required by the Agents pursuant to subparagraph

SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Agent and each person who controls any Agent within the meaning
of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act against any and all
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act,
the 1934 Act or other Federal or state statutory law or
regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arise
out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based
upon any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such
indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending
any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such case
to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made
therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Agent
specifically for use in connection with the preparation thereof,
and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Prospectus shall not
inure to the benefit of any Agent (or any person controlling such
Agent) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim,
damage or liability purchased the Notes which are the subject
thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Prospectus
as amended or supplemented in connection with the sale of such
Notes excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or
prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Notes to such
person in any case where such delivery is required by the 1933
Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact
contained in the Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented. This indemnity agreement will be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Each Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers
who signs the Registration Statement and each person who controls
the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934
Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
Company to each Agent, but only with reference to written
information relating to such Agent furnished to the Company by or
on behalf of such Agent specifically for use in the preparation
of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This
indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which
any Agent may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the
statements set forth in the last paragraph on the cover page and
under the heading "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus, as
supplemented or amended, constitute the only information
furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Agents for
inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing
indemnity, and you, as the Agents, confirm that such statements
are correct.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof;
but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not
relieve it from any liability which it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. In case
any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it
notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and,
to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to
the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid
notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there
may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties which are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall
have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal
defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such
action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon
receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and
approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying
party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this
Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof
unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate
counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in
accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it
being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not
be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel,
approved by the Agent in the case of subparagraph (a),
representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who
are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall
not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party
to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after
notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying
party has authorized the employment of counsel for the
indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and
except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability
shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such
clause (i) or (iii).

(d) To provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in
paragraph (a) of this Section 8 is due in accordance with its
terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable
from the Company on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the
Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, 
claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the
Agents may be subject in such proportion so that each Agent is
responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that
the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by such
Agent bears to the total sales price from the sale of Notes sold
to or through the Agents to the date of such liability, and the
Company is responsible for the balance; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8,
each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of the 1933
Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and
each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either
the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer of the Company who
shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of
the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Company, subject in each case to the provisions of this paragraph
(d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after
receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or
proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for
contribution may be made against another party or parties under
this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom
contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such
party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom
contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they
may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).

performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including:

this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company

force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or by
or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of
and payment for any of the Notes.

SECTION 11. TERMINATION.

(a) TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement
(excluding any agreement hereunder by an Agent to purchase Notes
as principal) may be terminated for any reason, with respect to
one or more, or all, of the Agents, at any time by either the
Company or one or more of the Agents upon the giving of 30 days'
written notice of such termination to the other party hereto. 
Any termination by the Company of this Agreement with respect to
one or more, but less than all, of the Agents shall be effective
with respect to such designated Agents only, and the Agreement
will remain in force and effect with respect to any other Agents
who remain parties hereto.

(b) TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE NOTES AS
PRINCIPAL. An Agent may terminate any agreement hereunder by
such Agent to purchase Notes as principal, immediately upon
notice to the Company at any time prior to the Settlement Date
relating thereto (i) if there has been, since the date of such
agreement or since the respective dates as of which information
is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse
change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the
earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company
and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, or (ii) if
there shall have occurred, since the date of such agreement, any
outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other national
or international calamity or crisis the effect of which is such
as to make it, in the judgment of such Agent, impracticable to
market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes,
or (iii) if, since the date of such agreement, trading in
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have
been suspended or limited, or (iv) if, since the date of such
agreement, a banking moratorium shall have been declared by
either Federal or New York authorities.

If, after the date of an agreement hereunder to purchase
Notes as principal and prior to the Settlement Date with respect
to such agreement, the rating assigned by Standard & Poor's
Ratings Group, a division of McGraw Hill, Inc. or Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. as the case may be, to any debt
securities of the Company shall have been lowered or if either of
such rating agencies shall have publicly announced that it has
under surveillance or review, with possible negative
implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company,
then the Company and the Agent mutually shall determine whether
the terms of such agreement to purchase Notes shall need to be
renegotiated and, if so, shall so negotiate in good faith the
revised terms of such agreement to purchase Notes. In the event
that the Company and the Agent reasonably fail to agree on any
such revised terms, then either the Company or the Agent may
terminate such agreement to purchase Notes.

(c) GENERAL. In the event of a termination under this
Section 11, or following the Settlement Date in connection with a
sale to or through an Agent appointed on a one-time basis,
neither party will have any liability to the other party hereto,
except that (i) the Agents shall be entitled to any commission
earned in accordance with the third paragraph of Section 3(b)
hereof, (ii) if at the time of termination (a) any Agent shall
own any Notes purchased by it as principal with the intention of
reselling them or (b) an offer to purchase any of the Notes has
been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the
purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has
not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 7 hereof
shall remain in effect until such Notes are so resold or
delivered, as the case may be, and (iii) the covenant set forth
in Section 4(h) hereof, the provisions of Section 9 hereof, the
indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Section 8
hereof, and the provisions of Sections 10, 14 and 15 hereof shall
remain in effect.

<PAGE>
SECTION 12. ADDITIONAL AGENTS.

The Company may from time to time designate additional
agents to participate in the sale of Notes as principal or agent
hereunder. Such agency participation may be either on an on-
going basis or on a one time basis for a single transaction. 
Such agents shall become a party to this Agreement and shall
thereafter be subject to the provisions hereof and entitled to
the benefits hereunder upon the execution of a counterpart hereof
or other form of acknowledgement of its appointment hereunder and
delivery to the Company of addresses for notice hereunder and
under the Procedures. After the time an Agent is appointed, the
Company shall deliver to the Agent copies of these documents
earlier delivered to other Agents under Sections 5(a), 5(b),
