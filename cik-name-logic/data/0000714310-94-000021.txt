VALLEY NATIONAL BANCORP'S STRONG LOAN GROWTH

CONTINUES TO FUEL INCOME GAIN

WAYNE, New Jersey, October 21, 1994 -- Valley National Bancorp
(NYSE:VLY) today reported net income of $43.1 million, or $1.60 per
share, for the nine months ended September 30, 1994. The results
reflect a 5.4 percent increase above the $40.9 million, or $1.54
per share, recorded during the first nine months of 1993 (1993 per
share amounts were restated for the stock dividend in 1994).

Valley reported net income of $14.1 million, or $0.52 per share,
for the third quarter ended September 30, 1994. The results
represent a 4.2 percent increase above the $13.5 million, or $0.51
per share, earned during the same period in 1993.

Valley's results for the first nine months of 1994 again position
it among the best performing banks in the United States, with an
annualized return on average assets of 1.64 percent and an
annualized return on average equity of 20.7 percent. Valley's
efficiency ratio of 43.9 percent continues to place Valley among
the most efficient banking organizations in the country.

On September 30, 1994, Valley's assets totalled $3.53 billion,
representing a 4.3 percent increase over the $3.38 billion in
assets a year ago. Most significantly, loans increased to $2.0
billion, 15.7 percent above a year ago. Total deposits reached an
all time high of $3.2 billion on September 30, 1994.

Continued growth in core banking operations, decreased amortization
of mortgage servicing rights and reduced expenses from the
consolidation of the People's acquisition were able to offset
higher interest expense on deposits and lower gains on sales of
securities and mortgage loans during the current quarter.

Gerald H. Lipkin, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of Valley National, recognized that new challenges lie ahead for
the banking industry, Valley and consumers with the recent
increases in interest rates and the wave of bank mergers. "Through
our strong core earnings, efficient operations and growing
franchise, Valley is poised to meet these new challenges," he said. 
"Our recently announced intended acquisitions of Rock Financial
Corporation and American Union Bank will help us enhance our
franchise and meet these challenges."

Net interest income before the provision for possible loan losses
was $104.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1994,
representing a 3.5 percent increase above the $101.1 million
recorded during the same period a year ago. For the third quarter
ended September 30, 1994, total net interest income, prior to the
provision for possible loan losses, decreased slightly to $34.8
million, compared with $35.5 million recorded during the third
quarter of 1993 due to an increase in interest expense on deposits.

Non-performing assets, including non-accrual loans and other real
estate owned ("OREO") were $23.0 million, or 1.1 percent of loans
and OREO at September 30, 1994, versus $25.3 million, or 1.3
percent of loans and OREO at June 30, 1994. This compares with
$27.0 million, or 1.5 percent of loans at September 30, 1993. 
Loans past due in excess of 90 days and still accruing interest
were $3.9 milion at September 30, 1994 as compared with $4.8
million at June 30, 1994 and $11.7 million at September 30, 1993.

Gains on the sale of securities and loans for the third quarter
amounted to $1.2 million, representing a 45.6 percent decrease from
the $2.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 1993, and for the
1994 nine-month period decreased 40.0 percent to $5.5 million
compared to the $9.1 million in the same period in 1993.

Valley's provision for possible loan losses for the third quarter
and nine-months ended September 30, 1994, was $900 thousand and
$2.7 million, respectively. This compares with a provision for
possible loan losses of $1.5 million and $5.0 million,
respectively, for the same periods in 1993. The allowance for
possible loan losses totalled $35.9 million at September 30, 1994,
or 1.77 percent of loans, net of unearned income, and 156 percent
of non-performing assets.

Valley continues to maintain its strong capital position with total
shareholders' equity of $280.6 million at September 30, 1994,
representing a book value per share of $10.37, a tier one leverage
ratio of 8.09 percent and a risk based capital ratio of 14.55
percent.
