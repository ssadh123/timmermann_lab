INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Emro Propane Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Emro Propane Company (an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil Company, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of USX Corporation) as of December 31, 1993, and the related
statements of income and retained earnings and of cash flows for the year then
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Emro Propane Company at December 31, 1993,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

EMRO PROPANE COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation - Emro Propane Company ("the Company") is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Emro Marketing Company ("EMC"), which is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Marathon Oil Company ("Marathon"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of USX Corporation ("USX").

Accounts Receivable - The Company's receivables arise primarily from
credit granted to customers for the purchase of propane and related
appliances and other merchandise. Accounts receivable determined to be
uncollectible are written off using the direct write-off method.

Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Propane and appliance inventories are determined by the last-in,
first-out method. Service parts are determined by the first-in,
first-out method.

Investment in USX Portfolio Delaware - The investment in USX Portfolio
Delaware represents shares of Class A, Series 1 Preferred Stock. These
shares are redeemable on a daily basis by either USX Portfolio Delaware
or the shareholder. Dividends are declared daily on the shares, and are
paid in fractional shares. The market value of these shares is $2,000
per share. These shares may be traded only between the shareholder and
USX Portfolio Delaware.

Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment is stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed by
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
asset ranging from four to 33 years. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred.

Intangible and Other Assets - Intangible assets consist principally of
goodwill, being the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases, and of
covenants not to compete. Goodwill and covenants not to compete are
stated at cost, net of amortization on the straight-line basis over
forty and ten years, respectively. Liabilities for covenants not to
compete are recorded as long-term covenants payable.

Income Taxes - The Company is included in the consolidated federal
income tax return filed by USX. The Company's provision for income
taxes is based on statutory income tax rates applied to pre-tax income
adjusted for certain permanent differences. USX requires its
subsidiaries, for financial statement purposes, to record income tax
expense or benefits in the current period in accordance with the tax
allocation rules under the Internal Revenue Code's consolidated return
regulations.

operating leases totaled approximately $1,119,046 for the year ended
December 31, 1993.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its
business. Certain claims, suits and complaints arising in the ordinary
course of business have been filed or are pending against the Company.
In the opinion of management, all such matters are covered by insurance,
are without merit, or involve amounts which, if resolved unfavorably,
would not have a significant effect on the financial position or results
of operations of the Company.

<PAGE> 12
8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

The Company participates in Marathon's noncontributory defined benefit
plan covering substantially all employees. The funding policy for the
plan is to make the minimum annual contributions required by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

Net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit pension plan during
1993 includes the following components:

<TABLE> 
<S> <C> 
Service Cost $ 403,759
Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 244,135
Actual return on plan assets (229,891)
Net amortization (10,049)
---------
Net periodic pension cost $ 407,954
=========
</TABLE>

The funded status of the defined benefit pension plan and the amounts
recognized in the balance sheet at December 31, 1993 are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C> 
Vested benefit obligation $(2,183,718) 
=========== 
Accrued benefit obligation $(2,390,170) 
=========== 
Projected benefit obligation $(3,692,608) 
Plan assets at fair value 2,433,435 
----------- 
Plan assets less than projected benefit obligation (1,259,173) 
Remaining unrecognized net asset existing at date 
of initial application (315,570) 
Unrecognized prior service cost 204,729 
Unrecognized net loss 498,175 
----------- 
Accrued pension cost $ (871,839) 
=========== 
</TABLE>

The assumed discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation was
7.00% at December 31, 1993. The assumed rate of future increases in
compensation levels was 5.00% at December 31, 1993.

9. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

At December 31, 1993, the Company had an invested cash balance of
$23,230,015 on deposit with USX Portfolio Delaware ("PFD"), a subsidiary
of USX, representing approximately 11,615 shares of USX Portfolio
Delaware Class A, Series 1 Preferred Stock, valued at $2,000 per share.
These shares are redeemable on a daily basis by either PFD or the
Company. These shares may be traded only between the Company and PFD.
They may not be traded between USX and any of its other subsidiaries.
During 1993 the Company earned $654,194 in dividends from PFD.

<PAGE> 13
The Company has the facility under a promissory note to borrow up to $30
million from PFD. In the event of a change in ownership of the Company,
PFD may demand repayment of any loan amount outstanding. If the loan in
whole is not so demanded before then, any final repayment is due on
November 30, 1998. The loan bears interest at the one-month LIBOR rate
on the last Euro-banking day of the previous month plus 100 basis
points. There were no borrowings under this unsecured note at December
31, 1993.

At December 31, 1993, the Company was owed $2,675,756 by EMC. This
balance was unsecured and interest free, and was settled in full in
January 1994.

During 1993, the Company purchased $44,000,000 of propane from EMC. All
transactions between the Company and EMC were consummated on terms
substantially equivalent of those that prevail in arm's-length
transactions.

10. INCOME TAXES

In 1992, USX and its subsidiaries, including the Company, adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," which requires an asset and liability approach in
accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. The temporary differences that give rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax liabilities at December 31,
1993 relate primarily to tax bases of property, plant and equipment in
excess of financial bases due to accelerated depreciation deducted for
income tax purposes.

The provision for 1993 income taxes consists of the following:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Current: 
Federal $ 5,515,751
State 279,094
Deferred 323,585
-----------
Provision for income taxes $ 6,118,430
===========
</TABLE>

The provision for income taxes varies from the Federal statutory rate on
income before income taxes primarily due to the dividends received
deduction, state income taxes, and the effect of the tax rate change in
the current year.

The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years 1988 through 1991 are
under various stages of audit and administrative review by the IRS. USX
believes it has made adequate provision for income taxes and interest
which may become payable for years not yet settled; however, none of the
provision is attributable to the Company.

At December 31, 1993, there were no operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards attributable to the Company's operations.

Other state taxes of approximately $460,000, including franchise taxes
and single business tax, are reflected in other operating costs.

<PAGE> 14
11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On September 1, 1994, Marathon sold the Company's assets to MAPCO Inc.
for approximately $178,046,000 and the transfer of MAPCO Florida Inc.'s
retail marketing assets in Florida.
