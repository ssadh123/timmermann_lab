Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated as the 9 3/8% Notes Due
2003, Series B, of the Company, limited in aggregate principal amount to
$60,000,000.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance and discharge of the
entire principal of all the Securities of any series upon compliance by the
Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
The Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the
Indenture, shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the

Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at
any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in
aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series to be affected
thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of
specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any
series, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive
certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences with respect to
such series. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be
conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note
and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in
lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Note.
Except as otherwise provided in the preceding paragraph or in Sections
8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 of the Indenture, no reference herein to the Indenture and
no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of and interest on this Note, at the place, at the respective times,
at the rate, and in the currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, this Note is transferable on the Security Register of the Company, upon
surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at
any other office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Securities registrar duly executed by, the
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or
more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of
a like tenor and of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the
Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection with the registration of such transfer
or exchange, other than certain exchanges not involving any transfer.
Certain terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture have the
meanings set forth therein.
This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
The Company, the Trustee for the Notes and any agent of the Company or such
Trustee may treat the Holder as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving
payment and for all other purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and
neither the Company, such Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice
to the contrary.
