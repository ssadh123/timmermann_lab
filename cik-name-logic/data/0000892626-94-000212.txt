824 MARKET STREET OFFICE BUILDING

Wilmington, Delaware
----------------------------------------

ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. Excelsior Associates
("Excelsior"), a limited partnership between Carlyle Real Estate Limited
Partnership - XI (the "Partnership"), JMB Investors - III, Inc. and Excelsior
Partners, L.P. owned 824 Market Street office building (the "Property")
located in Wilmington, Delaware. The mortgage lender, Teachers Insurance and
Annuity Association of America ("Lender"), commenced proceedings to realize
upon its security and was the successful bidder at the foreclosure sale held
on October 11, 1994. The deed was conveyed to the lender on December 12,
1994.

As of the date of conveyance of title the 824 Market Street office
building was approximately 56% occupied. Excelsior was aggressively seeking
replacement tenants for the vacant space, however, competition had risen
significantly due to new office building development in the area over the last
few years and to the contraction of tenants in the financial services
industry, resulting in lower effective rental rates. In order to reduce debt
service payments during the tenant turnover period, Excelsior had negotiated
with the first mortgage lender for a possible modification to the first
mortgage note. Such negotiations were unsuccessful and Excelsior received
notice of default. The lender then commenced proceedings to realize upon its
security.

As a result of the disposition of the 824 Market Street office building,
Excelsior will terminate its affairs and the Partnership will recognize a gain
for financial reporting and Federal income tax purposes with no corresponding
distributable proceeds, substantially all of which will be allocated to the
limited partners.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
(a) Financial Statements. Not applicable.
(b) Pro forma financial information - Narrative.
As a result of the lender realizing upon its security in the
property, there will be no further rental income, property operating expenses,
depreciation, or mortgage interest expense recorded for the Property which for
the Property's most recent fiscal year (the year ended December 31, 1993) were
$3,318,000, $1,775,000, $512,000 and $1,856,000, respectively. Rental income,
property operating expenses, depreciation, and mortgage interest expense for
the Property for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 were approximately
$1,291,000, $1,065,000, $407,000, and $1,276,000, respectively. Also, as a
result of the lender realizing upon its security in the Property, there will
be no further assets and liabilities related to the property, which at
September 30, 1994 consisted of land, building and improvements and deferred
lease commissions (net of accumulated depreciation and amortization) of
approximately $13,752,000; cash and other current assets of approximately
$823,000; current portion of long-term debt (including accrued interest) of
approximately $17,815,000, and other liabilities of approximately $227,000. 
The Partnership and the venture partner will record a gain on disposition of
investment property of approximately $4,900,000 and $180,000, respectively, in
1994.
