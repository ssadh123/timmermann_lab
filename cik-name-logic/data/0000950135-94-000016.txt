BOSTON EDISON ANNOUNCES 1993 EARNINGS

BOSTON, MA -- Boston Edison Company (BSE-NYSE) today reported earnings
per common share of $2.28 and $0.13 for the twelve and three months
ended December 31, 1993, respectively, versus earnings of $2.10 and
$0.24 for the same periods in 1992, respectively.

Earnings for calendar year 1993 increased primarily due to an annual
rate increase of $42 million which became effective November 1, 1992,
and lower purchased power expenses associated with a $60 million
contract which expired on October 31, 1993. Also affecting the
increase in earnings were lower interest expense and lower
amortization expense which resulted from a regulatory-approved delay
in expensing the remaining costs associated with the cancelled Pilgrim
2 nuclear unit, which will be expensed in 1994/1995. These were
partially offset by increased operations and maintenance expense, and
higher income tax and property tax expenses which resulted from the
discontinuance of regulatory-approved adjustments in prior years.
Retail electricity sales for the year were up 1.2%.

On a quarterly basis, earnings for 1993 reflect a change in the months
for which certain customers were billed at "summer surcharge" rates as
mandated by state regulators. This change in billing had the effect
of increasing second quarter earnings and reducing fourth quarter
earnings by approximately $0.23 per share.

Had the summer surcharge period not been changed, earnings per share
for the fourth quarter would have been $0.36 versus $0.24 from last
year, increasing primarily as a result of an annual rate increase of
$29 million which became effective November 1, 1993, lower purchased
power expenses associated with a $60 million contract which expired on
October 31, 1993 and lower amortization expense as explained above.
These were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance
expense and higher property tax expense as explained above. Retail
electricity sales for the quarter were up 0.5%.
