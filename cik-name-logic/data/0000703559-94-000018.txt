Item 5 - Other Events

Hubco, Inc. ("HUBCO") announced in a press release on July 6, 1994 
that it will not pursue revised applications to acquire Statewide Savings 
Bank, SLA ("Statewide") in a merger conversion transaction. The 
merger agreement between HUBCO and Statewide expired on June 30, 1994 
and will not be extended or amended.

HUBCO has capitalized approximately $650,000 in expenses related to the
Statewide application during the eighteen month application process.
These expenses will be charged to earnings in the second quarter of 1994.
HUBCO estimates that its second quarter income will be approximately equal to
the first quarter's income after absorbing these non-recurring expenses.
HUBCO's first quarter earnings per share were up 26% from the prior year 
and totalled $.58 per share. The strong earnings are attributable to 
recent acquisitions, including four branches of Polifly Federal Savings
and Loan Association acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation
during the first quarter, loan growth in the Commercial area, and the
recent increases in interest rates.
