AMERICAN GENERAL FINANCE CORPORATION
6 5/8% SENIOR NOTE DUE JUNE 1, 1997

AMERICAN GENERAL FINANCE CORPORATION, a corporation duly organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Indiana (the "Company", which term
includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to herein),
for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered
assigns, the principal sum of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS on June 1,
1997 (the "Maturity Date") and to pay interest thereon from May 24, 1994, or
from the most recent Interest Payment Date (hereinafter defined) to which
interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on June 1
and December 1 (each an "Interest Payment Date") in each year commencing on
December 1, 1994, and on the Maturity Date, at the rate of 6 5/8% per annum,
until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for.

Interest payments on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If any date for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, or interest on this Note (each a "Payment Date")
falls on a day which is not a Business Day (as defined below), the principal,

-1-
<PAGE>

premium, if any, or interest payable with respect to such Payment Date will be
paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on such Payment Date, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so
payable for the period from and after such Payment Date. "Business Day" means
each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on
which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated
by law or executive order to close.

The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any
Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or
one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered in the Security Register at
the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment,
which shall be the May 15 or November 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as
the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest
not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid
to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities)
is registered in the Security Register at the close of business on a Special
Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the
Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than ten
(10) days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any
other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be
required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. 

Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest on this Note will
be made in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Company
maintained for such purpose in The City of New York, in such coin or currency
of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for
payment of public and private debts.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth
after the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication, which further provisions
shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by
Citibank, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, or its successor thereunder,
by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, this Note shall
not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory
for any purpose.

one of a duly authorized issue of senior debt securities (hereinafter called
the "Securities") of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more
series under a Senior Indenture dated as of February, 1, 1993 (herein called
the "Indenture") between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein
called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the
Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto and the
Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of this series of Securities
reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations
of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and
the Holders, and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be,
authenticated and delivered.

The Notes are not subject to redemption, as a whole or in part, at the
option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder prior to the
Maturity Date.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be
continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in
the manner and with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the
Indenture. 

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture permits the Company and the
Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures, with the consent of
the Holders of not less than 66-2/3% in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of each series to be affected by such supplemental indentures, for
the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or
eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any
manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series. The Indenture
also permits the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all the
Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note
shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders
of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof
or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Note. 

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or
currency, herein prescribed. 

As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security
Register of the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose,

-4-
<PAGE>

duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the
Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one
or more new Notes having the same terms as this Note, of authorized
denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to
the designated transferee or transferees. 

The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the
Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein or herein set forth,
this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of
different authorized denominations, having the same terms as this Note.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the
Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the
Person in whose name this Note is registered in the Security Register as the
owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not any payment with respect to this
Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary. 

All capitalized terms used in this Note but not defined in this Note
which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in
the Indenture; and all references in the Indenture to "Security" or
"Securities" shall be deemed to include the Notes.

GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA,
EXCEPT THAT THE RIGHTS, LIMITATIONS OF RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, DUTIES AND
IMMUNITIES OF THE TRUSTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW

American General Finance Corporation

Re: 6-5/8% Senior Notes due June 1, 1997

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to American General Finance
Corporation, an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), in
connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of
$150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6-5/8%
Senior Notes due June 1, 1997 (the "Notes"), including the
preparation of:

(a) The Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3
(Registration No. 33-57910) (the "Registration Statement"),
including the Prospectus, dated March 1, 1993, constituting a
part thereof (the "Prospectus").

(b) The Pricing Agreement, dated May 17, 1994, including
the Underwriting Agreement incorporated therein, between the
Company and the underwriter of the Notes (together, the "Pricing
Agreement").

(c) The Senior Indenture, dated as of February 1, 1993,
between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee, pursuant to
which the Notes are to be issued (the "Indenture").

For purposes of this opinion, we have examined originals or
copies, identified to our satisfaction, of such documents,
corporate records, instruments and other relevant materials as we
have deemed advisable; and we have made such examination of
<PAGE>

statutes and decisions and reviewed such questions of law as we
have considered necessary or appropriate. In our examination, we
have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal
capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to
original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies,
and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to
facts material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates,
statements or representations of public officials, of officers
and representatives of the Company and of others, without any
independent verification thereof. 

The laws covered by the opinions expressed herein are
limited to the laws of the State of Indiana and the federal laws
of the United States.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the
opinion that:

1. The Company is existing as a corporation under the laws
of the State of Indiana.

2. The issuance of the Notes has been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action of the Company and, when the Notes
have been duly executed, authenticated, sold and delivered in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and as described in
the Registration Statement and in the Pricing Agreement, the
Notes will be valid and binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms,
except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights or by general equity principles.

We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to
the Registration Statement and to the reference to us under the
heading "Legal Opinions" in the Prospectus. In giving such
