ITEM 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

1. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Barnes Group Inc. met in
the fourth quarter of 1993 to consider the selection of independent
auditors for 1994. The Audit Committee, upon the recommendation of
management, recommended to the Board of Directors that Price Waterhouse be
selected as the Company's independent auditors for 1994. At a meeting held
on December 15, 1993, the Board of Directors accepted the recommendation of
the Audit Committee and proposed that the stockholders approve the
selection of Price Waterhouse as the Company's independent auditors for
1994.

2. If the stockholders of Barnes Group Inc. approve the selection of Price
Waterhouse as the Company's independent auditors for 1994 at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders to be held on April 6, 1994, Ernst & Young will be
dismissed as independent auditors for Barnes Group Inc. on April 6, 1994.

3. The reports of Ernst & Young dated January 26, 1993 and January 28, 1994
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1993
contained no adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or qualification or
modification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles,
except that the reports reflected that the Company adopted effective
January 1, 1992 Financial Accounting Standards 109, 106, and 112 relating
to income taxes and certain post-retirement and post-employment benefits. 
Ernst & Young agreed with the adoption of these accounting standards. With
respect to the fiscal years ended December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1993,
there were no disagreements between the Company and Ernst & Young on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which if not resolved to the
satisfaction of Ernst & Young would have caused it to make reference to the
matter in its report. No reportable event described in paragraph (a)(1)(v)
of Item 304 of Regulation S-K has occurred during the Company's fiscal
years ended December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1993.

4. The Company did not consult with Price Waterhouse during the fiscal years
ended December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1993 on any matter which was the
subject of any disagreement or any reportable event or on the application
of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or
proposed.

Form 8-K

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
