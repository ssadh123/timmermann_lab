FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NL RECORDS IMPROVED RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- October 24, 1994 -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE:NL) announced a
substantially reduced net loss for the third quarter of 1994 of $4.6 million,
or $.09 per share, on sales of $225 million compared to a net loss in the third
quarter of 1993 of $18.7 million, or $.37 per share, on sales of $202 million.
The improvement in NL's results was primarily driven by higher average selling
prices for its principal product, titanium dioxide pigments ("TiO2"), which
increased 6% over the third quarter of 1993. NL's net loss for the first nine
months of 1994 was $26.5 million, or $.52 per share, on sales of $664 million.
The net loss for the comparable 1993 period was $60.2 million, or $1.18 per
share, on sales of $622 million.

Operating income of Kronos' TiO2 business in the third quarter was $18.8
million, an increase of $13.0 million over the third quarter of 1993. In
addition to higher TiO2 selling prices, Kronos recorded a 4% increase in sales
volumes. As a result of improved pricing in all major markets, Kronos' average
TiO2 selling prices in the third quarter were 3% higher than the second quarter
of 1994. Kronos' operating income in the first nine months of 1994 was $21.3
million higher than that of the first nine months of 1993. J. Landis Martin,
President and CEO, stated, "We are encouraged by the recent trend of TiO2
selling prices and anticipate further improvements in 1995."

Rheox's operating income improved on higher volumes and lower operating costs.
Lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates contributed to the
improved results.

NL Industries, Inc. is a major international producer of titanium dioxide
pigments and specialty chemicals.
