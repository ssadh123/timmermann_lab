(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)
(Unaudited)

(a) ACCOUNTING POLICIES - The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared by AT&T Corp. ("AT&T" or the "Company") pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and,
in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of
only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
of the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash 
flows for each period presented. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of foreign entities based on their fiscal years,
which end either November 30 or December 31. The consolidated results 
for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the
full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with AT&T's 1993 Annual Report to Shareowners and Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1993 and the current year's previously issued
Form 10-Q. 

(b) RESTATEMENTS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS - Previously reported quarterly
results for 1993 were restated to reflect the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 112, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." In addition, the provisions
for business restructuring have been reclassified to costs and 
operating expenses.

(c) PROVISIONS FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING - Provisions for business
restructuring in the three months ended June 30, 1993 totaled $278.
These provisions included $215 for re-engineering customer support
functions for telecommunications services (including $55 for employee
relocation, $25 for outplacement costs, $30 for legal contingencies
and $105 for closing facilities, lease terminations and asset
abandonments associated with centralizing support services). There
were also $63 in provisions to provide for lease terminations, closing
facilities and other related expenses for restructuring activities in
other areas.

These provisions were reclassified as follows: $218 to selling, 
general and administrative expenses; $58 to the costs of products and
systems; and $2 to other line items.

(d) OTHER INCOME - In June 1993, AT&T sold its remaining 77% interest in
UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. to Novell, Inc. ("Novell") in exchange
for approximately 3% of Novell common stock. The gain on the sale was
$217.

(Unaudited)

(e) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES - Effective January 1, 1993, AT&T
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions." This standard requires companies to
accrue for estimated future postretirement benefit expenses during the
years employees are working and earning benefits for retirement. 
Previously, AT&T expensed these benefits as claims were incurred. AT&T
recorded an after-tax charge of $7,023 ($5.20 per share) to record the
unprovided portion of these liabilities as the cumulative effect of an
accounting change in the first quarter of 1993. This accounting change
does not affect cash flows.

Effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 112. This standard
requires companies to accrue for estimated future postemployment
benefits during the years employees are working and accumulating these 
benefits. Previously, AT&T recognized the separation costs as they
were identified and disability benefits when paid. AT&T recorded an
after-tax charge of $1,128 ($.84 per share) to record the unprovided
portion of these liabilities as the cumulative effect of an accounting
change in the first quarter of 1993. This accounting change does not
affect cash flows.

Also effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes." Among other provisions, this standard requires tax
assets and liabilities to be determined using the enacted income tax
rates for the years in which taxes will be paid or refunds received.
Prior to 1993, AT&T's deferred tax accounts reflected the statutory
rates that were in effect when the deferrals were initiated. The 
adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in a net income benefit of $383, or
$.28 per share. This benefit was recorded as the cumulative effect of
an accounting change in the first quarter of 1993. This accounting
change does not affect cash flows.

Effective January 1, 1994, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". The standard 
provides for the accounting and reporting for investments in equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all 
investments in debt securities. The new standard did not have a 
material impact on AT&T's results of operations or financial position.

Total inventories............. $3,972 $3,187

(g) STATUS OF PROSPECTIVE MERGER WITH McCAW CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
("McCaw")- In August 1993, AT&T and McCaw entered into a definitive
agreement to merge McCaw and a subsidiary of AT&T, making McCaw a
wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T (the "Merger"). The Merger is subject
to a number of conditions, including the receipt of outstanding
approvals (discussed below) and receipt of opinions that the Merger
will be tax free and will qualify for pooling-of-interests accounting
treatment. Various other approvals, including McCaw shareholder
approval, and review by various state regulatory agencies have been
obtained.

On July 15, 1994, AT&T, McCaw and the United States entered into a
proposed antitrust consent decree (the "Proposed Consent Decree")
which would permit the Merger by settling a suit challenging the
Merger filed the same day by the United States. The Proposed Consent
Decree requires approval by the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia. Under the Proposed Consent Decree, several conditions
are imposed on the future operations of AT&T and McCaw. These
conditions include: (i) the maintenance of McCaw (and McCaw
affiliates) as a subsidiary or entity separate from AT&T; (ii)
requirements that McCaw cellular systems, within 21 months of the
commencement of the action, cease providing interexchange services and
provide customers of McCaw cellular systems with equal access to any
interexchange carrier that offers service to the system; (iii)
requirements that McCaw cellular systems provide to all interexchange
carriers exchange access on an unbundled basis that is equal in type,
quality, and price to that provided to AT&T; (iv) a prohibition on the
sale by each of AT&T and McCaw of interexchange or local cellular
services at a price, term or discount that depends on whether the
customer obtains both AT&T's interexchange and McCaw's local cellular
services; (v) requirements that AT&T not discriminate in favor of
McCaw in the way in which certain services and products are made
available; (vi) restriction of the flow of certain non-public
information between AT&T and McCaw relating to unaffiliated wireless
system equipment customers of AT&T; (vii) a requirement for AT&T to
continue to provide technological and other support to its
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 13
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)
(Unaudited)

unaffiliated cellular system equipment customers; and (viii) a
requirement on AT&T to buy back any cellular system equipment sold to
an unaffiliated cellular carrier if the United States determines AT&T
has violated the information restrictions or support requirements. 

The requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15
U.S.C. Section 16, must be complied with before the Proposed Consent
Decree may be entered by the court. The requirements include: (i)
filing with the court and publication of the Proposed Consent Decree
and a competitive impact statement in the Federal Register at least 60
days prior to the effective date of the decree; (ii) an opportunity
for the public to provide written comments and an opportunity for the
United States to reply to such comments; and (iii) a determination by
the court that the Proposed Consent Decree is in the public interest. 
The parties to the Proposed Consent Decree have stipulated as follows:
(i) the Proposed Consent Decree may be entered by the court at any
time after compliance with the requirements of the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act; (ii) each party shall abide by and
comply with the provisions of the Proposed Consent Decree pending and
following entry by the court unless the Merger has been earlier
abandoned; and (iii) the United States may withdraw its consent at any
time prior to entry of the Proposed Consent Decree. 

The closing of the Merger, however, is not contingent on the prior
entry of the Proposed Consent Decree or the completion of the
requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act. If the
closing of the Merger occurs before the completion of such
requirements, it will nevertheless be subject to any lawful orders
that the court may impose as a result of the proceeding.

On April 5, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, acting on a motion filed by BellSouth Corporation on
December 2, 1993, ruled that AT&T's acquisition, under the proposed
Merger, of the interests owned by McCaw in certain cellular properties
controlled by Bell Operating Companies (the "BOCs") would violate the
Modification of Final Judgment of 1982 (the "MFJ"). The court
determined that AT&T must seek a waiver of the MFJ to proceed with the
Merger.

On May 31, 1994, AT&T filed for a waiver of the MFJ to permit the
Merger. Several parties filed responses with the court requesting
that various conditions be imposed on any waiver granted to AT&T, or
opposing the request for a waiver. The Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") has supported AT&T's
request for the waiver subject to certain conditions on AT&T. Oral
argument on AT&T's motion took place on July 21, 1994, and the matter
is pending. (See Form 8-K filed August 29, 1994 by AT&T regarding the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granting the motion
filed by AT&T for a waiver of Section I(D) of the MFJ.)

(Unaudited)

In August 1993, AT&T and Craig O. McCaw filed various applications
seeking consent of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC")
to the proposed transfer of control of McCaw to AT&T, which consent is
required prior to consummation of the Merger. Several parties,
including competitors of McCaw and/or AT&T, have filed petitions with
the FCC opposing the request for FCC consent or seeking to impose
conditions on the Merger. The FCC established an initial pleading
cycle which was completed on January 18, 1994. 

In May 1994, the FCC established a supplemental pleading cycle which
permitted review of certain of the documents filed by AT&T and McCaw
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
proceeding, and under which further comments and replies were filed. 
That pleading cycle was completed on July 1, 1994. The matter is
still pending a decision by the FCC. 

On August 8, 1994, Bell Atlantic Corporation, Bell Atlantic Mobile
Systems, Inc. ("Bell Atlantic Mobile"), NYNEX Corporation and NYNEX
Mobile Communications Co. ("NYNEX Mobile") filed an action (the "Bell
Atlantic Complaint") against AT&T and McCaw in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of New York. The action alleges that the
effect of the Merger may be to substantially lessen competition in
interstate trade and commerce in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton
Act. The relief requested includes: a preliminary injunction
preventing and restraining the Merger until the court has ruled on the
merits of the compliant; a judgment that the Merger violates Section 7
of the Clayton Act; and a permanent injunction enjoining the Merger
and any acquisition by AT&T of any direct or indirect interest in
McCaw. AT&T intends to oppose the action, including the preliminary
injunction, and believes it is without merit.

With respect to all of the foregoing, there can be no assurance that
the court or regulatory actions requested by AT&T will be granted or
granted without unacceptable conditions, or that AT&T will
successfully oppose the Bell Atlantic Complaint, or that other
challenges to the Merger will not be made on antitrust grounds. The
United States could challenge the Merger before or after it is
consummated if the Proposed Consent Decree is not approved by the
court or if the United States decides to withdraw its consent prior to
court approval.

If the Merger is not consummated by September 30, 1994, the Merger
agreement may be terminated by AT&T or McCaw. AT&T is not required to
consummate the Merger if any court or governmental or regulatory
authority of competent jurisdiction enjoins the Merger or imposes any
condition or restriction on its consummation unacceptable to AT&T in
its reasonable judgment.

AT&T AND SUBSIDIARIES AND McCAW AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Note 1 - Historical Presentation 

Previously reported quarterly results for AT&T for 1993 were restated
to reflect the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." In
addition, the provisions for business restructuring have been reclassified
to costs and operating expenses.

Certain amounts reported in McCaw's historical financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the AT&T presentations in the
accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet and Statements of
Income. Such reclassifications are not material to the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements. 

Note 2 - Exchange Ratio

As defined in the Merger Agreement, the Exchange Ratio will be one
AT&T Common Share for each share of McCaw Common Stock; provided, however,
that (i) in the event the Closing Date Market Price of one AT&T Common
Share (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) is less than
$53.00, the Exchange Ratio will be equal to $53.00 divided by the Closing
Date Market Price of one AT&T Common Share, but in no event greater than
1.111 AT&T Common Shares, and (ii) in the event the Closing Date Market
Price of one AT&T Common Share is greater than $71.73, the Exchange Ratio
will be equal to $71.73 divided by the Closing Date Market Price of one
AT&T Common Share, but in no event less than .909 of an AT&T Common Share. 
For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, an
Exchange Ratio of one AT&T Common Share per share of McCaw Common Stock (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) is assumed. 

Note 3 - Other Pro Forma Adjustments

(A) The McCaw Common Stock account has been adjusted to reflect the
assumed exchange of one AT&T Common Share, par value $1.00 per share, for
each of approximately 195.3 million shares of McCaw Common Stock, par value
$.01 per share, outstanding at June 30, 1994 (excluding shares of McCaw
Common Stock held by AT&T - see Note 3(B)). The difference between the par
value of the AT&T Common Shares and the par value of the McCaw Common
Stock, after giving effect to the assumed Exchange Ratio, is reflected as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital of $193.

(B) The $400 investment by AT&T in 14.5 million shares of Class A
Common Stock purchased in February 1993 has been eliminated. The weighted
average common shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 1993
and June 30, 1994 have been adjusted to give affect to the elimination of
this investment.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 22

(C) McCaw's historical financial statements reflect the adoption of
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," retroactive to January 1,
1991. AT&T adopted SFAS No. 109 effective January 1, 1993. For conformity
purposes, the pro forma combined financial statement information for AT&T
and McCaw has been adjusted as if McCaw had adopted SFAS No. 109 on January
1, 1993. Such adoption would result in the use of different tax
assumptions related to intangible assets McCaw acquired in purchase
business combinations in 1991 and 1992 that would increase the cumulative
effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 by $39. Accordingly, the pro forma 
combined net income and earnings per common share have been decreased by
$1,840 and $1.20, respectively, for the period ended June 30, 1993. Pro
forma combined total assets and shareowners' equity have been decreased $39
at June 30, 1994. Also, effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." McCaw adopted
SFAS No. 112 effective January 1, 1994. The impact of this standard on
McCaw's financial statements is immaterial, therefore no adjustment has
been made to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements. 

(D) No adjustments have been reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements for direct expenses related to the Merger. 
Direct expenses included in the historical periods presented have not been
adjusted for in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements as
such amounts are not material. 

(E) No adjustments to eliminate intercompany transactions and balances
have been made in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements as
such amounts are not material. 

(F) The cash dividends per common share in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements reflect AT&T's cash dividends declared in the
periods presented. McCaw has never paid cash dividends on the McCaw Common
Stock.

Note 4 - Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements assume that the
Merger qualifies as a "tax-free" reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.
