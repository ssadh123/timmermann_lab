ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On July 8, 1994, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") issued a
press release announcing that it has reached agreements, in principle, to settle
all class action securities lawsuits, In Re Advanced Micro Devices,
Securities Litigation (No. C-93-20662-JW, N.D. Cal.), and the derivative case,
George A. Bilunka, et al vrs. Sanders, et al (93-20727JW N.D. Cal.), currently
pending against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. The
agreement to settle is subject to the approval of AMD's board of directors and
confirmation by the United States District Court in San Jose, Calif. The suits
were filed in conjunction with AMD's September 2, 1993, announcements relating
to the Company's Am486 (Registered Trademark) family of products.

If approved, the cost of the settlements to the Company would be $34,000,000.
The Company believes current quarter financial results would not be materially
affected because of previously recorded settlement reserves for these cases,
insurance proceeds, and an unrelated one-time gain the Company expects to record
in the current quarter related to an award of damages in the AMD/Intel
Technology Agreement Arbitration currently under review by the California
Supreme Court.
