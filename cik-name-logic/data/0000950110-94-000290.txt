WASHINGTON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of Washington Bancorp, Inc. and
Subsidiary follow generally accepted accounting principles and general
practices applicable to the banking industry. The policies which materially
affect the determination of financial position, results of operations and cash
flows are summarized below.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Washington
Bancorp, Inc, (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Washington
Savings Bank (the "Bank"). All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

The statements of cash flows are presented using the direct method. For
purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are cash on hand,
amounts due from banks and Federal funds sold (generally due within a one-week
period).

SECURITIES

During 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
and the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115:
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS
115"). SFAS 115 requires entities to classify their securities into either a
held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading category. Each of these
classifications require a different basis of accounting.

Securities in which there is both the positive intent and ability to hold
until call date, if any, or maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and
carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts. Premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted using the level
yield method over the period to call, if any, or maturity for investments, and
over the estimated remaining lives based on anticipated prepayments for
mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses, if any, are recognized when
securities are sold by the specific identification method.

Securities which may be sold prior to maturity for either asset/liability
purposes or for other reasons are classified as available-for-sale and are
accounted for at fair value with fair value changes, net of tax, reported as a
net amount in a separate component of stockholders' equity.

The Company does not engage in trading securities; however, such
securities would be accounted for at fair value with fair value changes
reported in the income statement.

The effect of adopting SFAS 115 as of December 31, 1993 was to increase
securities by $286,000, reduce the net deferred tax asset by $100,000 and
increase stockholders' equity by $186,000. There was no effect on the results
of operations.

The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB"),
is required to hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to
one percent of the outstanding balance of mortgage loans or five percent of
its outstanding advances from the FHLB, whichever is greater.

LOANS

Loans in which there is both the intent and ability to hold until
maturity are carried at their principal amounts outstanding. Generally, when a
loan is past due as to payment of principal or interest for ninety days or
when, in the opinion of management, the accrual of interest should be ceased
before ninety days, it is the Company's policy to cease accruing interest and
to place such a loan on a "nonaccrual status". Any accrued but unpaid interest
previously recorded, if not adequately collateralized, is charged against
current period interest income. Cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded
as either income or as a reduction of principal, according to management's
judgement as to the collectibility of principal.

<PAGE>
WASHINGTON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
offset, and the resulting net amount is deferred and amortized as an
adjustment of the loans' yields. Net loan fees are generally amortized over
the contractual lives of the related loans.

Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.
No valuation allowance was required at December 31, 1993 or 1992. Gains and
losses, including deferred loan origination fees, are recognized when loans
are sold by the specific identification method.

In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS 114").
SFAS 114 establishes criteria for accounting for loans that have been
impaired. It requires that impaired loans be measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective
interest rate or at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of
the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The Company has not fully
evaluated the effect of SFAS 114 on its financial statements. SFAS 114 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The Company
plans to adopt SFAS 114 in 1995 with no prior period restatement.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON LOANS

The allowance for losses on loans is established through charges to
operations in the form of a provision for losses on loans. Loans which are
determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance account and
subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the account. The provision for
losses on loans is based upon percentage allocations with regard to the
performing loan portfolio, as well as specific allocations for classified
loans. Loans are classified in accordance with their estimated risk based on
various factors, including: (a) the financial status and credit history of the
borrower; (b) collateral value; (c) loan documentation; (d) prevailing and
anticipated economic conditions; and (e) such other factors that, in
management's judgement, warrant current recognition in providing an adequate
allowance.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED ("REO"), NET

REO consists of real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or
deed in lieu of foreclosure and "in-substance" foreclosures ("ISF"). A loan is
classified as an in-substance foreclosure even though actual foreclosure has
not occurred based upon the following criteria: the borrower has little or no
equity in the collateral based upon its current estimated fair value; proceeds
for repayment are expected to come only from the operations or sale of the
collateral; and either the borrower has abandoned control of the collateral or
it is doubtful that the borrower will rebuild equity in the collateral or
repay the loan by other means in the foreseeable future.

REO is carried at the lower of cost (principal balance of the former loan
plus cost of obtaining title and possession) or fair value less estimated cost
to sell. When a property is transferred to ISF, the excess of the loan balance
over market or the the fair value less estimated cost to sell is charged to the
allowance for losses on loans.

The allowance for losses on REO is established through charges to
operations in the form of a provision for losses on REO that is reflected in
the expense caption--"REO expense, net." Factors considered in establishing
the allowance for losses on REO include appraisals of the fair market value of
a property and management's assessment of the overall real estate market for
that type of property and its location. In addition, carrying costs (e.g. real
estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, and insurance), net of rental income,
are charged to operations in the current period and are reflected in the
expense caption--"REO expense, net".

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Land is carried at cost. Buildings, building improvements, and furniture
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation computed on the
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each type of asset.
Leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated amortization
computed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or useful life,
whichever is less. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense; major replacements and betterments are capitalized. Gains and losses
on dispositions are reflected in current operations.

INCOME TAXES

The Company and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return.
State income tax returns are filed on a separate basis.

Prior to 1993, the Company recorded income tax provisions in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.11: "Income Taxes" ("APB 11"),
which recorded deferred income taxes on transactions which are reported for
financial statement purposes in different years than for income tax
purposes--principally loan fees, interest on nonaccrual loans and carrying
costs of REO.

On January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109: "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109") with no prior
period adjustment. SFAS 109 requires an asset and liability approach, the
objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for
temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis
of assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when
such amounts are realized or settled. The effect of adopting SFAS 109, as of
January 1, 1993, was to increase assets and net earnings by $300,000, or $.13
per share.

PENSION PLAN AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

A noncontributory defined benefit pension plan is provided through
Retirement System Group Inc. that covers substantially all employees. Benefits
are based upon years of service and generally upon the employee's average
compensation during the three consecutive years prior to normal retirement.
The funding policy is generally to make the minimum annual contributions
required by applicable regulations. Pension cost is determined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 87: "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."
The Entry Age Normal Cost Method was used to determine the actuarial present
value of accumulated and projected benefit obligations.

During 1992, the Company undertook a policy to eliminate its balance sheet
liability under the new Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106:
"Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106").
This goal was achieved in a two step process. First, current retirees were
offered, and accepted, a lump sum payment equal to a percentage of the
estimated cost to the Company of each retiree's future health insurance
premiums in exchange for the Company's liability for future coverage. The
aggregate lump sum amount for all such retirees approximated $77,000 and was
paid in two equal installments in January 1992 and 1993. Second, the
obligation for future retirees was moved to the tax-qualified pension plan.
Future retirees who meet certain age and service requirements will be awarded
a supplemental pension benefit equal to a percentage of estimated future
health insurance premiums.

During 1992 and prior periods, postretirement health care benefits were
recognized in the year that the benefits were paid to certain retired
employees--the "pay-as-you-go" or cash basis. The costs of providing
postretirement health care benefits approximated $42,000 and $38,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

In December 1992, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112: "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS
112"). SFAS 112 requires accrual accounting for benefits provided to former or
inactive employees after employment but before retirement--including salary
continuation, disability benefits, severance pay and continuation of health
care benefits. Under SFAS 112, each benefit will be accrued either over the
employee's working career for benefits that vest or vary based on an
employee's years of service, or as an expense at the date of the event giving
rise to the benefits (e.g., at the date of disability). SFAS 112 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. Earlier application is not
required by the FASB. The Company plans to adopt SFAS 112 in 1994 with no
prior period restatement. Management believes that the effect of adopting SFAS
112 will not be significant on the financial position or results of operations
of the Company.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Disclosures are made of the fair value of financial instruments, both
assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the consolidated
balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value as of the
balance sheet

11
<PAGE>
WASHINGTON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

date. Changes in market conditions subsequent to that date are not reflected
and the fair value of financial instruments are not representative of the
Company's total value. For example, when quoted market prices are not
available, the Company calculates the present value of anticipated future cash
flows. In that regard, the estimated fair value will be affected by prepayment
and discount rate assumptions. Such method may not provide the actual amount
which would be realized in the ultimate sale of the financial instrument.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practical to
estimate that value:

Cash and short-term investments

The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Securities

Fair values are based on quoted market prices as published by various
quotation services or, if quoted market prices are not available, on dealer
quotes. Fair value of the investment in FHLB is its carrying amount.

Loan receivables and commitments to extend credit

Loans are grouped into homogeneous categories, such as one-to-four family
mortgages, consumer loans, and loans held for sale. Fair value is based on
either a quoted market price from a dealer for similar maturities, interest
rate and type of collateral or the present value of anticipated future cash
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to
borrowers with similar credit risks and for the same remaining maturities.

Deposit liabilities

Carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value for savings,
demand deposit, and money market accounts. Fair value of certificates of
deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

PER SHARE DATA

Income/(loss) per share was computed by dividing net income/(loss) for
each year by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (which excludes
unvested shares of the MRP).

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1992 and 1991 financial
statements to conform to the 1993 presentation.

2. CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

Reserves maintained to meet Federal Reserve Board regulations amounted to
$331,000 and $280,000 during the bi-weekly maintenance periods that included
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Interest on nonperforming loans which would have been recorded had such
loans been performing (based upon original contract terms) throughout the
period approximated $826,000, $609,000 and $975,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Interest income on those
loans, which is recorded only when received, amounted to $223,000, $416,000
and $548,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

During the first quarter of 1993, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition was
filed by the obligor of an approximately $9.0 million loan, a loan on which
the Bank currently has a first mortgage and an assignment-of-rents (the

14
<PAGE>
WASHINGTON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

"Bankruptcy Loan"). On November 10, 1993, the Court dismissed the bankruptcy
petition. Nevertheless, the Bank did not receive any of the rental payments
from April 1993 through November 1993, as the payments were made to a
debtor-in-possession account and pursuant to a Court Order were released to
the City of Philadelphia (and not to the Bank) to pay a substantial portion of
property tax arrearages. Rental payments were resumed to the Bank in December
1993. On January 29, 1994, the Bank paid approximately $450,000 to the City
of Philadelphia to resolve all remaining property tax arrearages and to pay
1994 property taxes. The amount of such payment was capitalized into the 
Bankruptcy Loan balance. The Bank anticipates that the Bankruptcy Loan will
be renegotiated during 1994. The Bank has classified the Bankruptcy Loan as
a nonaccrual loan included in the multi-family/commercial category. Management
believes that the Bank has adequate collateral with respect to the Bankruptcy
Loan and anticipates collection of the outstanding principal balance.

As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, $543,000 and $842,000, respectively, of
such loans represented collateralized real estate loans and $3,000 and
$24,000, respectively, represented uncollateralized loans. All such loans
were, in the opinion of management, made on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with outside third parties.

7. BORROWINGS

On February 1, 1993, the FHLB advanced the Company $400,000, maturing on
February 1, 1996. There were no advances during 1992. The average amount
outstanding during 1993 and 1991 was $367,000 and $23,308,000, respectively,
with a weighted average rate of 4.9% and 8.4%, respectively. The FHLB advance
is collateralized by

16
<PAGE>
WASHINGTON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

mortgage-backed securities and the mortgage loan portfolio. During the fourth
quarter of 1991, the proceeds primarily from the sale of one-to-four family
performing mortgage loans and investment securities were used to prepay
$15,900,000 of FHLB advances, incurring approximately $1,034,000 of early
extinguishment costs. The costs have been included in the consolidated
statements of operations as an extraordinary item. Due to the net operating
loss carryforward position, there was no income tax effect for these
transactions.

In 1987, the Bank established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"),
which borrowed $l,449,000 from an unrelated third party lender to acquire
138,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at $10.50 per share (secured by
the shares purchased). The loan was scheduled to mature in 1997; however, the
ESOP, at its option, repaid the remaining balance of the loan during 1992 with
no penalty. The ESOP repaid the loan as contributions were received from the
Bank. Interest was paid and accrued monthly at a variable rate which
approximated the prime rate. The related interest expense incurred for the
years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991 approximated $1,000 and $23,000, at an
effective rate of 3.9% and 9.3%, respectively.

The Bank also has a line of credit, which expires on September 1, 1994,
of approximately $14.3 million with the FHLB, none of which was in use at
December 31, 1993.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining
the net periodic pension cost was 8.00% in 1993, 1992 and 1991. The projected
benefit obligation is based on an assumed discount rate of 7.00% in 1993 and
8.00% in 1992, and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 5.5% and 6.00%
in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The original net transition asset of $650,660
is being amortized over approximately eleven years and is due to expire in
1998.

9. BENEFIT PLANS

The expense charged to operations for the following benefit plans during
the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 approximated $151,000,
$193,000 and $376,000, respectively.

Incentive Stock Option Plan ("Option Plan")

The Option Plan authorizes the granting of 172,500 nonqualified and
incentive stock options through 1997 to certain officers and other key
employees. Each option entitles the holder to purchase one share of Common
Stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value as of the date of
grant. Options may be exercisable at such times (not after ten years from
grant) as the Stock Option Plan Committee determines. The exercise price may
be paid in cash or Common Stock. The following table summarizes stock option
transactions during the three years ended December 31, 1993:

Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP")

The ESOP, established for employees age 21 or older who have at least one
year of credited service, was funded by discretionary cash contributions that
are invested in the Common Stock. Benefits may be paid either in shares of
Common Stock or in cash. Shares purchased with such proceeds are held in a
suspense account by the ESOP Trustee for allocation among members. Benefits
become 20% vested each year of credited service, with 100% vesting after 5
years of credited service. Forfeitures will be reallocated among remaining
participating employees. Benefits may be payable upon retirement, early
retirement, disability or separation from service.

The ESOP Trustee must vote all allocated shares held in the ESOP in
accordance with the instructions of the participating employees. Shares for
which employees do not give instructions, shares held by the ESOP trustee and
unallocated shares will be voted in the same proportion as the shares with
respect to which instructions have been given.

The ESOP is subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (which applies to all employee stock
ownership plans), and the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service and the
Department of Labor thereunder. The Company has begun to terminate the ESOP.
The effect of terminating the ESOP will not be significant to the financial
position or results of operations of the Company.

Management Recognition Plan ("MRP")

The MRP was established as a method of providing employees in key
positions with a proprietary interest in a manner designed to encourage such
key employees to remain with the Company. The Company contributed $630,000 to
the MRP to enable it to acquire 60,000 shares of Common Stock. Such amount
represents deferred compensation and has been accounted for as a reduction of
stockholders' equity. Awards generally vest over either a three or five year
period and will be 100% vested upon termination of employment by death,
disability, retirement, or following a change in control of the Company.

Option Plan for Outside Directors ("Directors' Option Plan")

Each member of the Board of Directors who is not an officer or employee
of the Company was granted a single non-qualified option to purchase 7,187.5
shares (aggregate 57,500 shares) of the Common Stock at an exercise price
equal to the fair market value as of the date of grant. Each option granted
under the Directors' Option Plan expires upon the earlier of ten years
following the date of the option or thirty days following the date the
optionee ceases to be a director. The following table summarizes the
Directors' Option Plan transactions during the three years ended December 31,
1993:

Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors ("DCP")

During 1993, the DCP, a plan which covers any outside director who has
served in that capacity for at least five consecutive calendar years, was
approved in principle subject to certain conditions. Eligibility, benefits and
vesting will continue should an outside director subsequently become an
officer or employee. An outside director becomes fully vested upon either
fifteen years of service as director, sixty-five years of age, death, or
change in control of the Company, as described below. Subsequent to
retirement, the DCP provides an annual benefit equal to (a) 50% of the outside
director's annual retainer in effect at the time of retirement (the "then
current retainer"), plus (b) 5% of the then current retainer for each
additional year of service in excess of 5 years (up to a maximum of 10
additional years).

19
<PAGE>
WASHINGTON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

Benefits are based on actuarial assumptions then in effect under the
Retirement Plan of the Bank. Benefits payable under the DCP shall be paid
directly from the general assets of the Company. The Company is not obligated
to set aside, earmark or escrow funds or other assets to satisfy its
obligations under the DCP. At December 31, 1993, the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation reflected on the consolidated balance sheet
in other liabilities was $25,000.

In the event of a change in control of the Company, each outside director
(regardless of whether he has served as a director for five years) who is
neither an officer nor an employee shall receive a single cash payment equal
to four times the then current retainer. The cumulative liability under a
change in control of the Company is approximately $252,000. Such cumulative
liability in excess of the aforementioned $25,000 was not reflected in the
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 1993.

Bonus programs

Employees of the Bank are awarded cash bonuses based upon length of
service, responsibility level and performance.

======= ===== =====

Upon adoption of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets of $2.4 million, deferred
tax liabilities of $1.0 million and a valuation allowance of $809,000 were
established, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $550,000 as of January
1, 1993. As of December 31, 1993, the $809,000 valuation allowance was reduced
to zero as a result of taxes paid in prior and current years and anticipated
future taxable income sufficient to realize these tax benefits. Based upon the
Company's historical and current pretax earnings, management believes it is
more likely than not that the Company will generate future net taxable income
in sufficient amounts to realize its net deferred tax asset at December 31,
1993, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will generate any
earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings. In addition during
1993, an income tax refund of $747,000 was received as a result of an
overassessment of previously paid federal income taxes.

During 1992, the Company utilized its remaining net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $754,000 for federal income tax purposes and
approximately $1,700,000 for financial reporting purposes to record an
extraordinary credit in the amount of $539,000, which partially offset income
tax expense of $628,000. During 1991, the $552,000 of expense was primarily a
result of the write-off of the net deferred tax asset as a result of the
Company's tax loss carryforward position.

differences between the book and tax basis reserve for losses on loans and REO
are treated as temporary differences requiring deferred taxes, except that no
deferred tax liability is required for the base year tax reserve of
approximately $270,000 as of December 31, 1993.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Total rent expense for all bank branches under operating leases was
approximately $73,000, $130,000 and $105,000 for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Future minimum lease payments required
under noncancellable operating leases for bank branches as of December 31,

Certain of the above leases contain renewal options which provide for
increased rental payments as a result of increases in real estate taxes. It is
generally expected that in the normal course of business, leases that expire
will be renewed or replaced by other leases with similar terms.

The Company has entered into a severance agreement with a certain key
executive. In the event of a change in control of the Company (such as the
Merger referred to in Note 15), this executive will receive a payment equal to
three times his average annual compensation over the five previous years of
his employment with the Bank, if terminated for other than cause or upon
certain other events of termination of employment. In the event that severance
payments combined with other payments to be made to this executive by the
Company in connection with the Merger would constitute an excess parachute
payment under Section 280 G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
then the executive will receive a combination of benefits and payments which
will equal the maximum aggregate amount which can be paid to the executive
without constituting such an excess parachute payment.

In October 1991, a complaint was filed by a former officer in New Jersey
Superior Court against the Company, the Bank and certain directors and
officers seeking unspecified damages relating to the termination of such
officer's employment. The Company and individual defendants have filed an
answer and have asserted certain counterclaims. Although this complaint was
recently dismissed, it was dismissed without prejudice to the plaintiff's
right to refile the complaint by March 31, 1994. In April 1992, a complaint
was filed in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and the Bank
seeking unspecified damages and alleging violations of state securities laws,
certain banking laws and state common law. This lawsuit is in the discovery
stage. The plaintiffs recently amended their complaint to add claims against
nine individual defendants, including current and former officers and
directors of the Company and the Bank. Management believes that the defendants
have meritorious defenses in both of these matters and

intends to vigorously defend these matters. Given the uncertainties involved in
judicial proceedings and the preliminary stage of discovery in these matters,
management cannot determine the precise amount of any potential loss that may
arise in these matters. Accordingly, no provision for loss, if any, that may
result upon resolution of these matters has been recorded in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

The Bank is also subject to other legal proceedings involving collection
matters, contract claims and miscellaneous items arising in the normal course
of business. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of such legal
proceedings will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the
Company or the Bank.

12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Off-Balance-Sheet Risk

In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial
instruments with off-balance-sheet risk which are properly not recorded in the
consolidated financial statements. These financial instruments principally
represent commitments to extend credit to potential borrowers and involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk. At December 31,
1993 and 1992, the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
potential customers was represented by the contractual amount of the financial
instruments as follows:

Expiration
Contractual Interest Dates
Amount Rates Through
---------- ------- ----------
At December 31, 1993:
Loan commitments--variable . . . . . $1,575,000 6.3%- 9.5% March 1994
Loan commitments--fixed. . . . . . . 4,939,000 6.3 -10.5 March 1994
Lines of credit--variable. . . . . . 1,081,000 7.5 -11.0 September 1994
Undisbursed construction loans--
fixed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 853,000 8.0 -10.0 August 1995
At December 31, 1992:
Loan commitments--variable . . . . . $2,628,000 5.8%- 8.0% March 1993
Loan commitments--fixed. . . . . . . 2,519,000 7.8 -10.5 March 1993
Lines of credit--variable. . . . . . 808,000 8.0 -11.0 November 1993
Undisbursed construction loans--
fixed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 197,000 7.0 -10.0 October 1993

Since loan commitments and lines of credit may expire without being
exercised, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future
cash requirements. In addition, expiration dates may be extended. The amount of
collateral obtained upon originating the loan is based upon management's credit
evaluation of the potential borrower and the real estate financed.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company's exposure to credit risk is dependent upon the economic
condition of its primary market areas for lending--Bergen and Hudson counties,
New Jersey. In addition, as of December 31, 1993, the Bankruptcy Loan is the
only loan to any one borrower whose aggregate loan concentration was greater
than 10% of stockholders' equity. Refer to Note 4 for a discussion of the
Bankruptcy Loan. Furthermore, another borrower whose aggregate loan balance was
greater than 10% of stockholders' equity as of December 31, 1992, prepaid such
loan during 1993.

The Company originates adjustable-rate loans to manage its interest
exposure on its deposits. The adjustable-rate loans have interest rate
adjustment limitations with annual and lifetime caps and are generally indexed
to the 1 and 3 year Treasury indices. Future market factors may affect the
correlation of the interest rate adjustment with the rates paid on deposits that
have been primarily utilized to fund such loans. No loans had reached their
interest rate adjustment limitation ceiling as of December 31, 1993.

13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

In 1987, when the Bank converted from a savings bank in mutual form to a
savings bank in stock form, the Company established a liquidation account in
an amount equal to the Bank's surplus and reserves at December 31, 1986
($14,351,000). The liquidation account will be maintained for the benefit of
eligible depositors who held deposit accounts of $50 or more in the Bank as of
December 31, 1985 and who continue to maintain their accounts in the Bank. The
liquidation account is reduced annually to the extent that eligible depositors
have reduced their eligible deposits (subsequent increases will not restore an
interest in the liquidation account). In the unlikely event of a complete
liquidation, each eligible depositor will be entitled to receive a
distribution from the liquidation account in a proportionate amount to the
then current adjusted eligible balances for accounts then held. No dividends
may be paid to stockholders if such dividends reduce stockholders' equity
below the liquidation account, which was approximately $1.4 million at
December 31, 1993.

Certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer
funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. FDIC
regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the
Company without prior approval of the FDIC to net profits (as defined) for the
current year and the retained net profits (as defined) for the preceding two
years. In addition, State banking regulations allow for the payment of
dividends in any amount provided that capital stock will be unimpaired and
there remains an additional amount of paid-in capital of not less than 50% of
the capital stock amount. As of December 31, 1993, the undistributed earnings
of the Bank approximated $11.6 million, of which $3.6 million was available
for the payment of dividends to the Company.

14. REGULATORY MATTERS

During the third quarter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC") completed its examination of the Bank as of August 2, 1993. As a
result of that examination, the FDIC rescinded its Memorandum of
Understanding which the Bank had signed on December 22, 1992 with the FDIC and
the State of New Jersey Department of Banking in connection with their
examination as of July 13, 1992.

24
<PAGE>
WASHINGTON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "FRB") completed
an off-site analysis of the Company. As a result of that analysis, the FRB
rescinded its Memorandum of Understanding, which the Company had originally
signed on August 13, 1991 in connection with the FRB's examination as of
December 31, 1990.

Under banking policies issued by the FDIC and the FRB, the Company and
the Bank must maintain an adequate level of capital sufficient to meet a
leverage capital ratio, a core risk-based capital ratio and a total risk-based
capital ratio. The leverage capital ratio is calculated by dividing core
capital by average total assets of the most recent quarter-end. The risk-based
capital ratios require the Company and the Bank to classify their assets and
certain off-balance-sheet activities into categories, and maintain specified
levels of capital for each category. The least capital is required for the
category deemed to have the least risk, and the most capital is required for
the category deemed to have the greatest risk. For purposes of leverage and
risk-based capital guidelines, core capital (also known as Tier 1 capital)
consists of common equity in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") excluding net unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities and deferred tax assets that are dependent on
the future taxable income greater than one year, and total capital consists of
core capital plus a portion of the allowance for losses on loans. The
qualifying portion of the allowance for losses on loans for the Company and
the Bank was approximately $1.8 million and $2.3 million as of December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, capital ratios
were as follows:

December 31,
------------------------------------
1993 1992
---------------- ----------------
Capital ratios: Required* Company Bank Company Bank
- - --------------- -------- ------- ---- ------- ----
Leverage. . . . . . . . . . 5.00% 11.70% 11.38% 10.62% 10.33%

Total risk-based. . . . . . 10.00 24.81 24.16 17.58 17.12
- - ------------
*For qualification as a well-capitalized institution.

15. MERGER AGREEMENT

On November 8, 1993, the Company signed a definitive agreement (the
"Agreement") providing for the merger of the Company with and into Hubco, Inc.
of Union City, New Jersey. Under the terms of the Agreement, shareholders of
the Company will receive either $16.10 in cash or .6708 of a share of new
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of Hubco, Inc. for each share of the
Company's common stock. In addition, the Company issued an option to Hubco,
Inc., exercisable in certain circumstances, to acquire 765,000 shares of its
authorized but unissued stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The Agreement is
subject to several conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Since significant conditions to effect the merger have not occurred, most
merger costs are not included in the 1993 results of operations in the
accompanying financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Washington Bancorp, Inc.
Hoboken, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Washington Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Washington Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As disussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993
the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and its method of 
accounting for investments in debt and equity securities.

As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company is presently a defendant in two lawsuits. One lawsuit seeks unspecified
damages and alleges violations of state securities laws, certain banking laws,
and state common law. The other was filed by a former Bank officer and alleges
wrongful termination and seeks unspecified damages. Legal counsel has advised
the Company that the effect, if any, of the ultimate outcome of these actions 
cannot presently be determined, and accordingly, no provision for loss, if any, 
that may result upon resolution of these matters has been made in the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
