STERLING SOFTWARE ANNOUNCES
ACQUISITION OF AMERICAN BUSINESS COMPUTER

Acquisition of ABC strengthens Sterling's position as the
leading provider of EDI software in the world

DALLAS, August 2, 1994 -- Sterling Software Inc. (SSW-NYSE) today announced
the acquisition of American Business Computer (ABC) in a stock transaction
structured as a pooling of interests. ABC, based in Ann Arbor, MI, is the
leading provider of UNIX-based EDI software in North America. For the year
ended June 30, 1994, ABC had annual revenue of approximately $5.1 million.

"UNIX is the fastest growing segment of the EDI software market, expected
to grow at an average rate of 40% per year over the next five years," and Torrey
Byles of BIS Strategic Decisions, a leading technology research firm.

Sterling L. Williams, president and chief executive officer of Sterling
Software, commented on the acquisition, saying, "This merger makes Sterling
Software the market leader in the fastest growing segment of the EDI translation
software market, strengthening our position in the EDI software market and the
broader electronic commerce market as well." Warner C. Blow, president of
Sterling Software's Electronic Commerce Group, added, "With the acquisition of
ABC, Sterling Software now offers the strongest suite of multi-platform EDI
software products in the world. Both Sterling and ABC customers will greatly
benefit from the strength of the combined operations."

The operations of ABC will be merged into Sterling's Interchange Software
Division (ISD), one of Sterling's four Electronic Commerce Group divisions.
Following the merger, ABC's principals -- Kimba Vasquez, president and chief
executive officer, and Patrick Davis, chief operating officer -- will join
Sterling's ISD executive staff as vice president of business development and
vice president of operations, respectively.

Sterling Software Inc., headquartered in Dallas, is a worldwide leader in
electronic commerce, systems software and government-related professional
services. The company employs approximately 2,900 people in more than 50
offices worldwide organized into four groups and sixteen divisions to focus on
its three key markets and the international marketplace. Revenue in 1993 was
$411.8 million.
