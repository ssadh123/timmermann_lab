ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On August 2, 1994, Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, a subsidiary of the
Corporation ("the Subsidiary"), sold 1,900,000 (and an additional 285,000 if
oversubscribed) shares of common stock at an offering price of $9.00 per share.

The net proceeds from the offering, which amounted to approximately $15,903,000
not including the over-allotment, were used in part by the Subsidiary to retire
indebtedness to the Corporation of approximately $9,644,000, and to repay bank
debt of approximately $4,500,000 incurred to fund the payment of a special
dividend to the Corporation. The remainder of the proceeds will be used by the
Subsidiary for general corporate purposes, including working capital.

Following the completion of this sale, the Corporation will own approximately
75.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Subsidiary
(73.3% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full).

With proceeds from the retirement of debt from the Subsidiary and its revolving
credit facility, the Corporation prepaid $12,500,000 of its Senior Notes due
September 30, 2000, at a premium of approximately $1,344,000 on August 2, 1994.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

the transaction does not currently meet materiality requirements.
