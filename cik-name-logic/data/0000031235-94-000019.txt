Notes to Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On May 3, 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses: the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division. Beginning with the second quarter of 1994, these businesses are 
being reported as discontinued operations with results for prior periods 
restated. On June 23, 1994, the Company announced Sanofi has agreed to 
acquire the pharmaceutical business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. for $1.675 
billion in cash and its interest in the "Over-the-Counter" alliance with 
Sterling Winthrop Inc. On October 1, 1994, the Company completed this sale. 
On August 29, 1994, the Company announced SmithKline Beecham plc has agreed to 
acquire the consumer health business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. for $2.925 
billion in cash. On September 6, 1994, the Company announced Johnson & Johnson
has agreed to acquire the Clinical Diagnostics Division for $1.008 billion in 
cash. On September 26, 1994, the Company announced Reckitt & Colman plc has 
agreed to acquire the worldwide household businesses of L&F Products for 
$1.55 billion in cash. On October 14, 1994, the Company announced Forstmann 
Little & Co. has agreed to acquire the do-it-yourself products businesses of 
L&F Products for $700 million in cash. The Company expects to complete these 
transactions upon receipt of regulatory approvals. In addition, as part of the 
divestiture, the Company is actively negotiating with potential buyers for its 
pharmaceutical research and development facility and its NanoSystems unit, and 
anticipates closing dates for these transactions over the next few months.

As of June 30, 1994, the Company concluded that measurement dates had occurred 
for the sales of the non-imaging health businesses. Accordingly, the 
financial statement information related to these businesses has been presented 
on one line in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, "net assets 
of discontinued operations", and in the "discontinued operations" section of 
the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The amounts presented for prior 
periods have been restated for appropriate comparability. The "net assets of 
discontinued operations" represents the assets intended to be sold offset by 
the liabilities anticipated to be assumed by potential buyers of these 
businesses. The amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 
for prior periods have been restated to reflect the allocation of interest 
expense from continuing operations to discontinued operations. The allocation 
of interest expense was performed by reference to the interest expense on 
indebtedness that is anticipated to be repaid from the net proceeds received 
from the divestment transactions.

The Company currently does not anticipate an overall loss on the divestment 
transactions including income from operations during the phase-out period 
which is estimated to end on or about December 31, 1994. Consequently, all 
gains estimated at this time will be recognized by the Company at the closing 
date of such transactions.

Summarized results of the Health businesses, including an allocation of 
interest expense, are as follows:

1991.

KODAK TO SELL STERLING WINTHROP TO SMITHKLINE BEECHAM FOR $2.9 BILLION

Continuing Progress in Divestiture Program
Strengthens Focus on Core Imaging Businesses

Rochester, N.Y. August 29, 1994--Eastman Kodak Company today announced an 
agreement to sell its Sterling Winthrop Inc. subsidiary, a leading supplier of 
consumer health products, to SmithKline Beecham for $2.925 billion in cash.

Under terms of the agreement, SmithKline Beecham will acquire from Kodak 100 
percent of the stock of Sterling Winthrop Inc. This will provide SmithKline 
Beecham with all of Sterling Winthrop's assets including its global consumer 
health products business, all personnel, brands, facilities, intellectual 
properties, and other assets.

The agreement follows Kodak's previously announced sale of Sterling Winthrop's 
pharmaceutical business to Sanofi SA of France in exchange for $1.675 billion 
in cash and Sanofi's interest in a consumer health products joint venture 
between Sanofi and Sterling Winthrop.

Both transactions are expected to be completed upon receipt of regulatory 
approvals.

"This agreement is a major step in our continuing divestiture program. When 
complete, Kodak's resource base and management attention will be sharply 
focused on its core imaging businesses," said George M.C. Fisher, Kodak's 
chairman, president, and CEO. "We believe this transaction represents a solid 
strategic fit between SmithKline Beecham, a world leader in healthcare, and 
our Sterling Winthrop subsidiary."

SmithKline Beecham Chief Executive Jan Leschly said: "This is an important 
step toward our goal of becoming the world's leading healthcare company. The 
combination of Sterling Winthrop's extensive geographic reach and SmithKline 
Beecham Consumer Healthcare's excellent brand portfolio creates a powerhouse 
in the increasingly important field of self-medication, and is a landmark 
opportunity to make SB the world leader in OTC medicines."

Sterling Winthrop's global consumer health products business generated more 
than $1 billion in revenues during 1993. The company sells a wide array of 
well known over-the-counter analgesics and other medicines.

Among the leading consumer health brands which SmithKline Beecham will acquire 
with Sterling Winthrop are: Bayer aspirin in the U.S., Panadol analgesics (one 
of the worlds' leading pain relievers); Phillips' milk of magnesia and 
Andrew's gastrointestinal products; Valda cough-cold products; Neo-Synephrine 
decongestants; and Stri-Dex and Hinds skin care products.

Sterling Winthrop manufactures consumer health products in more than 19 
locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Latin America and the 
Pacific Rim. The company markets products under the Sterling Health name and 
its product development efforts are supported by a dedicated, world-class 
research and development organization.

Proceeds from the transaction will be used to substantially reduce Kodak's 
debt and for other company purposes.

As part of its divestiture program, Kodak intends to sell in separate 
transactions its Clinical Diagnostics Division, and the household and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of its L&F Products unit.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO ACQUIRE KODAK'S CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS UNIT

Rochester, N.Y., and New Bruswick, N.J., Sept. 6, 1994--Eastman Kodak Company 
and Johnson & Johnson today announced an agreement calling for Kodak to sell
its Clinical Diagnostics business, a leading worldwide supplier of diagnostic 
products, to Johnson & Johnson for $1.008 billion in cash.

The agreement calls for Kodak to transfer to Johnson & Johnson essentially all 
its assets relating to the Clinical Diagnostics business. This includes all 
personnel, patents and technology, production equipment and products of the 
clinical business.

Kodak also has agreed to continue to provide customer equipment service 
support to Johnson & Johnson customers in order to maintain the current level
of service excellence.

During 1993, Kodak's Clinical Diagnostics division generated worldwide 
revenues of $535 million.

Kodak Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer George M.C. Fisher said: 
"Thousands of medical professionals around the world depend on diagnostic 
products from our Clinical Diagnostics Division. This agreement with a 
worldclass health care company will enable Clinical Diagnostics to continue to 
meet the needs of these valued customers."

"This announcement comes one week after our agreement with SmithKline Beecham 
for the sale of Sterling Winthrop. It demonstrates our resolve to rapidly 
achieve our strategic goal of total dedication and resource commitment to our 
core imaging businesses," Fisher added.

Ralph S. Larsen, Chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson said: "This acquisition 
fits perfectly our strategic objective of enhancing our business in diagnostic 
products. The acquisition will add important positions in clinical chemistry 
and immunodiagnostics to our existing diagnostics businesses and significantly 
broaden our customer base in the hospital central diagnostic laboratories. 
When combined with our existing blood virus screening and diagnostic products 
used in blood donor centers, hospitals, and other laboratories, and our home 
test products in blood glucose monitoring, pregnancy and other applications, 
we believe this will raise our worldwide market position to number three in 
diagnostics." 

At the time the transaction is completed, Clinical Diagnostics will become an 
operating company of Johnson & Johnson, based in Rochester, N.Y.

Current major Clinical Diagnostics manufacturing, research and administrative 
facilities are located in Rochester, N.Y.; Cardiff, Wales; Pollards Wood, 
England; and Strasbourg, France. Johnson & Johnson expects to continue to 
operate from these sites.

Both parties expect to complete the transaction upon obtaining any necessary 
regulatory approvals.

Proceeds from the transaction will be used to substantially reduce Kodak's 
debt and for other company purposes.

HOUSEHOLD BUSINESSES OF L&F PRODUCTS TO BE ACQUIRED BY RECKITT & COLMAN

Agreement Marks The Start Of Final Phase In Kodak's Continuing Divestiture 
Program

Rochester, N.Y. Sept. 26 -- Eastman Kodak Company today announced an agreement 
to sell the worldwide household businesses of its L&F Products unit, a leading 
supplier of cleaners, disinfectants, personal care, and professional products, 
to London, England-based Reckitt & Colman, plc for $1.55 billion in cash.

The agreement calls for Kodak to transfer to Reckitt & Colman all assets 
relating to the household businesses of L&F Products. This includes 
personnel, brand names, products, patents, technology, and production and 
distribution facilities supporting the household products businesses.

During 1993, L&F Products generated worldwide revenues of approximately 
$800 million from sales of these businesses.

"This transaction takes us much closer to our strategic goal of total 
dedication and resource commitment to our core imaging businesses," said 
George M.C. Fisher, Kodak's Chief Executive Officer. "I am pleased to achieve 
an agreement that benefits all parties, including Kodak, Reckitt & Colman, the 
people of L&F Products, and the many consumers who trust our well-known brand 
name products."

Commenting on today's announcement, Veron Sankey, Chief Executive of Reckitt & 
Colman, said: "The acquisition of L&F's household businesses represents a 
unique opportunity for us to achieve two important objectives. First, we are 
transforming the position and prospects of our U.S. household products 
business and, second, we are taking a major step forward towards becoming one 
of the leading worldwide household products groups."

Upon completion of the transaction, L&F Products' Household businesses will be 
merged with Reckitt & Colman's businesses.

L&F's household businesses are headquartered in Montvale, N.J., as is its 
technical center for product development. Manufacturing and distribution 
facilitied are located in Belle Mead, N.J.; Lincoln, Ill.; Alliance, Ohio; 
Sidney, Ohio; Toledo, Ohio; and Glasshutte, Germany (under the Shulke & Mayr
name).

L&F Products markets a family of well known products under a variety of leading 
brand names, including Lysol cleaners and disinfectants, Mop & Glo cleaner and 
polish, Resolve carpet cleaners, Ogilvie home permanents, Chubs Baby Wipes, 
and Wet Ones moist towelettes. Products from L&F household businesses are 
sold in 37 countries around the world. 

Both parties expect to complete the transaction upon obtaining any necessary 
regulatory approvals. In addition, Reckitt & Colman must obtain shareholder 
approval for the transaction.

The "do-it-yourself" operation of L&F Products is the last large business 
remaining to be sold as part of Kodak's divestiture program. In addition, 
the company is selling its pharmaceutical research and development facility and
its NanoSystems subsidiary, a small technology development operation, both 
located near Philadelphia, Pa.

Kodak has said that the proceeds from its divestiture program will be used to 
substantially reduce debt and for other company purposes.

KODAK COMPLETES SALE OF STERLING WINTHROP PHARMACEUTICALS
BUSINESS TO SANOFI

Rochester, N.Y., October 3, 1994 -- Eastman Kodak Company and Sanofi SA 
announced today the completion of the sale of Sterling Winthrop's worldwide 
pharmaceuticals business to Sanofi, a leading French healthcare and beauty 
products company.

The closing date for the transaction was October 1. Sanofi purchased Sterling 
Winthrop's interest in its pharmaceutical alliance with Sanofi in exchange for 
$1.675 billion in cash and Sanofi's interest in a separate European 
over-the-counter medicines alliance.

Sanofi did not acquire Sterling Winthrop's research and development center 
located near Philadelphia, Pa., or its NanoSystems unit, a technology 
development unit established to commercialize pharmaceuticals based on 
patented small particle technology. Both will be sold in separate 
transactions.

Subsequent to the closing, Sanofi sold the diagnostic imaging portion of 
Sterling Winthrop's business to Nycomed of Norway.

Kodak also will sell Sterling Winthrop's worldwide over-the-counter medicines 
businesses to SmithKline Beecham in a separate transaction. That transaction 
will close upon both parties obtaining regulatory approval.

L&F PRODUCTS 'DIY' BUSINESSES
ACQUIRED BY FORSTMANN LITTLE

Kodak's Divestiture Program Essentially Complete
Company Now Focused on Core Imaging Businesses

Rochester, N.Y., October 14, 1994 -- Eastman Kodak Company today announced an 
agreement to sell the do-it-yourself (DIY) products businesses of its L&F 
Products unit to Forstmann Little & Co., a New York City-based investment 
partnership, for $700 million in cash.

The agreement calls for Kodak to transfer to Forstmann Little all assets 
relating to the DIY businesses of L&F Products. This includes personnel, brand 
names, product formulations and technology, plus production and distribution 
facilities supporting the DIY businesses.

"This transaction completes the major portion of our divestiture program. In 
less than six months, we have reshaped Kodak. We are a smaller company with a 
stronger balance sheet, focused exclusively on our core imaging businesses," 
said George M.C. Fisher, Kodak's Chief Executive Officer.

L&F Products' DIY businesses market a wide range of wood finishing products 
including interior stains and clear finishes, exterior waterproofing products, 
interior wood refinishing products and specialty enamels. Key brands include 
Thompson's, Minwax, Formby's, Red Devil and Ronseal (in the United Kingdom and 
Ireland).

The parties intend to close the transaction by mid-November. Kodak will use 
the proceeds to reduce debt and for other company purposes.

As part of this divestiture program, Kodak also will sell its pharmaceutical 
research and development facility and its NanoSystems unit, a small technology 
development operation. Both are located near Philadelphia, Pa.

Non-U.S. Venture Companies, all as determined in accordance with

Schedule 2.5(b)(iii) hereto.

(c) In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser shall pay to

Seller within 30 days after the Closing Date:

(i) the sum of $1.6 million with respect to the

outstanding phantom stock appreciation rights under the Sterling

Winthrop Inc. Affiliates Phantom Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the

"SAR Plan") of the Transferred Employees (as defined in

Section 5.5(b)) on the Closing Date; provided that Seller shall cause

such phantom stock appreciation rights to be fully vested on the

Closing Date and to remain outstanding for the balance of their

respective exercise periods as set forth in the applicable notice of

grant, except to the extent agreed otherwise by a Transferred

Employee; and

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 54

(ii) the sum of $4.0 million with respect to the account

balances of the Transferred Employees under the Sterling Winthrop

Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan on the Closing Date. 

Section 2.6 Business Post-Closing Adjustments.

(a) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), and shall

deliver to Purchaser, (i) no later than the Closing Date, a Working Capital

Statement and a Net Worth Statement, in each case as of December 31, 1993

(respectively, the "Opening Working Capital Statement" and the "Opening Net

Worth Statement", and together, the "Opening Statements"), and (ii) within

60 days following the Closing, a Working Capital Statement and a Net Worth

Statement, in each case as of the Closing Date (respectively, the "Closing

Working Capital Statement" and the "Closing Net Worth Statement", and

together, the "Closing Statements"). The parties shall have the right to

correct manifest errors in the Opening Statements within 60 days after the

Closing Date (any corrected Opening Statement delivered to Purchaser shall

replace such Opening Statement delivered on the Closing Date for all

purposes under this Agreement and be deemed to have been delivered on the

Closing Date).

(b) Purchaser and Purchaser's accountants shall, within 60

days after the delivery by Seller of the Closing Statements, complete their

review of such Statements. In 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 55

the event that Purchaser determines that one or more of such Statements

have not been prepared in accordance with Schedule 1.1(1) and 3.7(a)(ii),

or that one or both Closing Statements have not been prepared on the same

basis as the related Opening Statement, Purchaser shall inform Seller in

writing (the "Purchaser's Objection"), setting forth a specific description

of the basis of Purchaser's Objection and the adjustments to the Net

Working Capital and/or the Aggregate Newco Net Worth which Purchaser

believes should be made, on or before the last day of such 60-day period. 

Seller shall then have 30 days to review and respond to Purchaser's

Objection. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve all of their

disagreements with respect to the determination of the foregoing items

within 10 days following the completion of Seller's review of Purchaser's

Objection, they shall refer their remaining differences to Coopers and

Lybrand or another internationally recognized firm of independent public

accountants as to which Seller and Purchaser mutually agree (the "CPA

Firm"), who shall, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, determine on

the basis of the principles set forth in Schedule 1.1(l) and 3.7(a)(ii),

and only with respect to the remaining differences so submitted, whether

and to what extent, if any, the Net Working Capital and/or the Aggregate

Newco Net Worth, as reflected on the Closing Statements, require

adjustment. The CPA Firm shall deliver its written 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 56

determination to Purchaser and Seller no later than the twentieth day 
after

the remaining differences underlying the Purchaser's Objection are referred

to the CPA Firm, or such longer period of time as the CPA Firm determines

is necessary. The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive and binding

upon Purchaser and Seller. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm

shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser and Seller

shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records

and any work papers (including those of the parties' respective

accountants) relating to the Opening Statements and the Closing Statements

and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm.

The "Adjusted Closing Statement" (or the "Adjusted Closing Net

Worth Statement") shall be (i) the Closing Working Capital Statement (or

the Closing Net Worth Statement, as the case may be) in the event that (x)

no Purchaser's Objection is delivered to Seller during the 30-day period

specified above with respect to such Statement, or (y) Seller and Purchaser

so agree, (ii) the Closing Working Capital Statement (or the Closing Net

Worth Statement, as the case may be), adjusted in accordance with the

Purchaser's Objection in the event that Seller does not respond to

Purchaser's Objection (to the extent related to such Statement) within the

30-day period following receipt by Seller of Purchaser's Objection, or

(iii) the Closing 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 57

Working Capital Statement (or the Closing Net Worth Statement, as the case

may be), as adjusted by either (x) the agreement of Seller and Purchaser or

(y) the CPA Firm.

In the event that the adjustment of a Closing Statement

pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) discloses that it is appropriate to include

an item in the calculation of Net Working Capital (or the Aggregate Newco

Net Worth, as the case may be) that had been omitted from the related

Opening Statement or to omit an item in the calculation of Net Working

Capital (or the Aggregate Newco Net Worth, as the case may be) that had

been included in the related Opening Statement, Seller shall prepare a

revised Opening Statement so that the differences between the amount of Net

Working Capital (or the Aggregate Newco Net Worth, as the case may be)

reflected on the Opening Statement and on the Closing Statement reflect

only the impact of the passage of time on the balances of the accounts

included in the determination of Net Working Capital (or the Aggregate

Newco Net Worth, as the case may be).

(c) Purchaser shall provide Seller and its accountants full

access to the Books and Records, any other information, including working

papers of its accountants, and to any employees to the extent necessary for

Seller to prepare the Closing Statements, the Adjusted Closing Working

Capital Statement and the Adjusted Closing Net Worth Statement.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 58

(d) Within 10 Business Days following issuance of both the

Adjusted Closing Working Capital Statement and the Adjusted Closing Net

Worth Statement, the net adjustment payment payable pursuant to this

Section 2.6(d) hereof (the "Net Adjustment Payment") shall be paid by wire

transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by

Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be. The Net Adjustment Payment shall

be the arithmetic sum of the adjustment payment in respect of the Adjusted

Closing Working Capital Statement and the adjustment payment in respect of

the Adjusted Closing Net Worth Statement, each determined as follows:

(i) the adjustment payment in respect of the Adjusted Closing Working

Capital Statement shall be the difference, if any, between (x) Net

Working Capital, as reflected on the Adjusted Closing Working Capital

Statement, and (y) Net Working Capital, as reflected on the Opening

Working Capital Statement.

(ii) the adjustment payment in respect of the Adjusted Closing Net Worth

Statement shall be the difference, if any, between (x) the Aggregate

Newco Net Worth, as reflected on the Adjusted Closing Net Worth

Statement, and (y) the Aggregate Newco Net Worth, as reflected on the

Opening Net Worth Statement.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 59

The Net Adjustment Payment shall be payable by Purchaser to

Seller, if positive, and by Seller to Purchaser, if negative.

(e) On the date of any transfer of assets from a Seller

Retirement Plan to a Transferee Pension Plan, Seller shall pay to Purchaser

the Pension Shortfall Amount, if applicable, or the Purchaser shall pay to

the Seller the Pension Excess, if applicable.

Section 2.7 Disposition of Cash and Short-term Investments. 

Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause all cash balances, investment

securities and other short- and medium-term investments held by Gamma to be

distributed or otherwise paid, in a manner chosen by Seller, to Seller or

one of Seller's Affiliates that does not constitute a part of the

Transferred Business. All costs and expenses of the distributions or

payments contemplated by this Section 2.7 (including liabilities for any

Taxes arising as a result of such distributions or payments) shall be borne

by Seller.

Section 2.8 Transfer of the OTC Portion.

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at

the Closing, Purchaser agrees to sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver

to Seller, and Seller agrees to purchase from Purchaser, all of Purchaser's

right, title and interest in and to the OTC Venture, the OTC Shares and the

OTC Assets.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 60

Section 2.9 Closing.

(a) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Sullivan &

Cromwell, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004 at 12:01 A.M. New York

City time, on October 1, 1994, provided that all of the conditions set

forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2(e) and 6.3(e) hereof have been satisfied or

waived with respect to at least (x) all Transferred Assets located in the

United States and Puerto Rico and (y) the OTC Portion of the Purchase

Price, or at such other time and place as the parties hereto may mutually

agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is called the "Closing Date".

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in

this Agreement, to the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer,

conveyance or delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance

or delivery to (x) Purchaser of any Transferred Asset or (y) Seller of any

part of the OTC Portion is prohibited by any applicable law or would

require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents

or waivers and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall

not have been obtained prior to the Closing or, in the case of the

Transferred Assets, at the date of the Closing the conditions set forth in

Section 6.1 have not been satisfied with respect to Transferred Assets

located outside of the United States, this Agreement shall not constitute a

sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or any 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 61

attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof. 

Following the Closing, the parties shall use reasonable efforts, and

cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such authorizations,

approvals, consents or waivers; provided, however, that neither Seller nor

Purchaser shall be required to pay any consideration therefor, other than

filing, recordation or similar fees payable to any governmental authority,

which fees shall be shared 2.9(b))equally by Purchaser and Seller. 

Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, (i) the parties

shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements

designed to provide to (x) Purchaser the benefits and liabilities of use of

such Transferred Asset and (y) Seller the benefits and liabilities of use

of such part of the OTC Portion, in each case from the Closing Date through

the date of the relevant closing, and (ii) to the extent legally

permissible, Seller shall transfer to Purchaser the effective management of

the Transferred Business and, to the extent such transfer is legally

impermissible, operate the Transferred Business in accordance with

Purchaser's instructions and at Purchaser's cost. Once such authorization,

approval, consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance

or delivery of a Transferred Asset or part of the OTC Portion, as the case

may be, not sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the

Closing is obtained, Seller or Purchaser, 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 62

as the case may be, shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver

such Transferred Asset or part of the OTC Portion, as the case may be, to

Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, at no additional cost. To the

extent that any such Transferred Asset or part of the OTC Portion, as the

case may be, cannot be transferred or the full benefits and liabilities of

use of any such Transferred Asset or part of the OTC Portion, as the case

may be, cannot be provided to Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,

following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.9(b), then Purchaser and

Seller shall enter into such arrangements (including subleasing or

subcontracting if permitted) to provide to the parties the economic (taking

into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent of

obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the perfor-

mance by Purchaser and Seller of their respective obligations thereunder.

(c) Seller shall endeavor to transfer as many of the

Transferred Assets to Purchaser as is practical on the Closing Date. It is

understood, however, that Seller will be undertaking restructuring

transactions with respect to certain of the Transferred Assets that may not

be complete prior to the Closing Date. Subject to Section 2.9(b) above,

Seller will complete such transfers of Transferred Assets to Purchaser by

December 31, 1994 (it being understood that any ruling from Tax or other

governmental authorities regarding 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 63

the Tax effect of the transactions referred to in the previous sentence

shall not be deemed to constitute required governmental or third party

authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers referred to in Section

2.9(b)).

Section 2.10 Deliveries by Purchaser. At the Closing,

Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, and with respect to Sections 2.10(f) and

2.10(g) as applicable, to Kodak, the following:

(a) the Cash Portion, in immediately available funds by wire

transfer to an account designated by Seller not less than two business days

prior to the Closing;

(b) assignments, in form and substance acceptable to Seller,

assigning to Seller all of Seller's right, title and interest in the OTC

Venture, OTC Assets and all OTC Shares; 

(c) such instruments of assumption and other instruments or

documents, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller, as may be

necessary to effect Purchaser's assumption of the Assumed Liabilities;

(d) such other instruments and documents, in form and

substance reasonably acceptable to Seller, as may be necessary to effect

the Closing;

(e) a duly executed copy of each of the Ancillary Agreements; 

(f) the certificates and other documents to be delivered

pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof; and

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 64

(g) any payment required pursuant to Section 2.5(b) hereof.

Section 2.11 Deliveries by Seller and Kodak. At the Closing,

Seller, and with respect to Sections 2.11(b) and 2.11(f) and as applicable,

Kodak, shall deliver to Purchaser the following:

(a) bills of sale and any other appropriate instruments of

sale and conveyance, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to

Purchaser, transferring all tangible personal property included in the

Transferred Assets to Purchaser;

(b) assignments, in form and substance acceptable to

Purchaser, assigning to Purchaser all Ethical Intellectual Property and,

subject to Section 2.12 hereof, Seller's interests in all corporations,

partnerships and other entities which interests are included in the

Transferred Assets;

(c) deeds, in limited warranty or other similar form, and any

other customary instruments of sale or conveyance, in each case in form and

substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, transferring all Owned Real

Property to Purchaser subject to any and all Permitted Encumbrances;

(d) assignments or, where necessary, subleases, in form and

substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 65

assigning or subleasing to Purchaser all Leased Real Property;

(e) such other instruments or documents, in form and substance

reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, as may be necessary to effect the

Closing;

(f) a duly executed copy of each of the Ancillary Agreements; 

(g) copies of surveys and title insurance policies in the

possession of Seller or Seller's representatives, if any, with respect to

Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property and, if applicable, copies of

certificates in the possession of Seller or Seller's representatives with

respect to Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property;

(h) the certificates and other documents to be delivered

pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof; and 

(i) any payments required pursuant to Section 2.5(b) hereof.

Section 2.12 Agreement of Means of Transfer. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 2.1, 2.3, 2.8, 2.10 or

2.11 hereof, (i) Seller and Purchaser hereby agree to restructure and to

transfer the Transferred Assets (and related Assumed Liabilities and

Transferred Employees) and the assets (and related liabilities)

constituting part of the OTC Portion, in each case as described in Schedule

2.12(a)(i), in the manner therein described, and (ii) Seller

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 66

and Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to agree, on a country-by-

country basis as to the restructuring and means of transfer of the

Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Transferred Employees (e.g.,

the sale of the equity interests in corporate or unincorporated entities or

the sale of the assets held by and assumption of liabilities of such

entities) to the extent not described in Schedule 2.12(a)(i). If not

otherwise described in Schedule 2.12(a)(i) and subject to Section 2.12(c),

with respect to the OTC Portion, the OTC Shares will be transferred in

stock transactions and the OTC Assets will be transferred in an asset

transaction.

(b) If an agreement has not been reached pursuant to Section

2.12(a) on or before August 31, 1994 regarding the means of transfer of the

Transferred Assets (and related Assumed Liabilities and Transferred

Employees) in any country, the means of transfer in each such country shall

be determined in accordance with the following procedure which shall be

completed on or before September 1, 1994:

(1) A list shall be compiled of all such countries (the

"Listed Countries");

(2) Purchaser and Seller shall flip a coin to determine which

of them (the "First Chooser") shall choose the first country pursuant to

clause (3);

(3) The parties shall alternate, beginning with the First

Chooser, in selecting from the Listed Countries, 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 67

countries that have not already been chosen. The party that selects any

country shall choose, as the means of transfer, either (i) a transfer of

equity interests or (ii) a transfer of assets in that country.

The means of transfer chosen pursuant to this Section 2.12(b)

shall be binding unless the parties agree otherwise.

(c) The parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding whether a

transfer of assets occurs by transferring an interest in an entity or the

assets held by such entity, or any other means chosen pursuant to Section

2.12(a) hereof, the transfer will be structured in a manner that gives

effect to the definitions of Transferred Assets, Excluded Assets, Assumed

Liabilities, Excluded Liabilities, OTC Assets and OTC Shares. The

foregoing shall include, without limitation, the right of Seller to remove

any Excluded Asset from an entity constituting a Transferred Asset prior to

transferring such entity.

(d) In the event that the parties determine, pursuant to this

Section 2.12, that any assets constituting part of the OTC Portion shall be

transferred otherwise than through the transfer of the OTC Venture, the OTC

Shares or the OTC Assets, Purchaser shall, as of the Closing Date, make

representations and warranties to Seller and Kodak, solely with respect to

such assets to be transferred by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser,

comparable in scope 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 68

to the representations made by Seller in Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and, if

applicable, Sections 3.16 and 4.7 relating to the transfer of the

Transferred Assets and the OTC Assets, as the case may be.

materially adversely affect 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 72

Purchaser's ability to conduct the Transferred Business substantially 
as

heretofore conducted or materially impair or delay the ability of Seller to

effect the Closing (together with the consents, approvals, waivers,

adversely affect or delay Seller's or Kodak's ability to perform its

obligations hereunder.

Section 3.6 Binding Effect. This Agreement constitutes, and

each of the Ancillary Agreements when executed and delivered by the parties

thereto will constitute, a valid and legally binding obligation of each of

Seller and Kodak enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of

general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to

general equity principles.

Asset and Liability Statement of the Transferred Business and the unaudited

fairly present the financial condition of the Transferred Business as of

the date thereof and will be prepared on the same basis as the Asset and

Liability Statement, except as will be described in the notes thereto.

Liability Statement are Related to the Business and arose out of or were

incurred in the conduct of the Transferred Business.

Section 3.8 Litigation and Claims. (a) Except as set forth

in Schedule 3.8(a), there is no civil, criminal or administrative action,

(other than those related to Minority Subsidiaries) or any of the

Transferred Assets (except where owned by Minority Subsidiaries) other than

those which, individually or in the

unincorporated entities the interests in which, or assets held directly or

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 77

employees (and timely paid to the appropriate governmental entity or set

aside in an account for such purposes) proper and accurate amounts for all

periods through the date of this Agreement in compliance with all Tax

withholding provisions of applicable Federal, state, local and foreign laws

(including, without limitation, income, social security and employment Tax

withholding for all types of compensation) except such amounts, which when

added to all other such amounts not so withheld, paid or set aside, would

not be material; (i) there is no contract, agreement or intercompany

account system in existence under which Seller or any of the Subsidiaries

have, or may at any time in the future have, an obligation to contribute to

the payment of any portion of a Tax (or pay any amount calculated with

reference to any portion of a Tax) determined on a consolidated, combined

or unitary basis with respect to an affiliated group (as defined in Section

1504 of the Code) or other group of corporations of which the Subsidiaries

are or were a part which when taken together with all other such contracts,

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 78

agreements, or account systems result in an obligation that is 
material;

and (j) adequate provisions in accordance with GAAP appropriately and

consistently applied (except as set forth on Schedule 3.7(a)(ii)) have been

made in the Asset and Liability Statement for the payment of all non-U.S.

Tax liabilities of the entities described in clause (a) with respect to the

Business for the periods covered thereby that were not yet due and payable

as of the dates thereof, regardless of whether the liability for such Taxes

Service, and Seller is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in

revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Except as set forth

in Schedule 3.10(b), there is no material pending or threatened litigation

relating to the Plans and, to the knowledge of Seller, no such litigation

expired as of the date hereof, could subject Seller or any Majority Owned

Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code

or Section 406 or 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

plan of any entity which is considered one employer with Seller under

Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate").

Seller and the Majority Owned Subsidiaries have not incurred any

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 80

withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle

has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or

by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date

hereof.

an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not

waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of

ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither

Seller nor any of the Majority Owned Subsidiaries has provided, or is

required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer

plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

(e) Neither Seller nor any of the Majority Owned Subsidiaries

has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit

Plan, except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(e).

(f) Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.10(f), neither

Seller, its Majority Owned Subsidiaries nor Kodak has any announced plan or

legally binding commitment to establish any additional Benefit Plan or to

amend, modify or terminate any existing Benefit Plan.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 81

(g) Neither Seller nor the Majority Owned Subsidiaries have

any obligation to contribute to any multiemployer plan.

covering non-U.S. Employees comply in all material respects with applicable

law. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(h), Seller and its Majority

Owned Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to

non-U.S. Employees.

result in the payment or series of payments to a Transferred Employee or to

any other person of a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G

of the Code.

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement will not (i) entitle any Transferred Employee to severance pay

(other than any deemed termination indemnities due to non-U.S. Transferred

Employees), or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase

the amount of compensation due to any such Transferred Employee or Former

Employee, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as listed on

Schedule 3.10(a) and designated as a Section 3.10(j) plan.

the Development Agreement and the BMS Agreements in accordance with past

practice and that with respect to the Business, other than in the ordinary

and usual course, it shall and shall cause the subsidiaries (other than

Minority Subsidiaries) to:

(i) not approve any new individual capital expenditure that

is in excess of $1,000,000;

(ii) not dispose of or incur, create or assume any Encumbrance

on any individual capital asset of the Business if the greater of the book

value or the fair market value of such capital asset exceeds $1,000,000

other than Permitted Encumbrances;

(iii) not incur any indebtedness for money borrowed or enter

into any contract or other commitment (including any hedging arrangement or

other derivative transaction), in each case that constitutes an Assumed

Liability in excess of $1,000,000;

(iv) not enter into any transaction that would materially

adversely affect Purchaser's ability to conduct the Transferred Business

substantially as heretofore conducted;

(v) not increase materially the salary, wage, rate of

compensation, commission, bonus or other direct or indirect remuneration

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 103

any Transferred Employees, or enter into any contract or other binding

commitment in respect of any such increase, nor amend, adopt or terminate

any Benefit Plan covering Transferred Employees or Former Employees in any

way that materially increases the amount of the Assumed Liability in

respect of such plan or enter into any negotiation in respect of or enter

into any collective bargaining agreement covering Transferred Employees

that would constitute an Assumed Liability;

(vi) not amend in any respect that would materially adversely

affect the use and enjoyment thereof by Purchaser, or terminate, any of the

leases relating to 90 Park Avenue, New York, New York or any other leases

relating to a material Leased Real Property or default in the performance

of any material covenant or obligation thereunder which default is not

cured within any applicable grace period; and

(vii) continue its pricing and sales practices substantially in

accordance with Seller's past practices.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Business shall be

permitted at all times prior to the Closing Date to make distributions of

cash to Seller as provided in Section 2.7.

(c) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing,

except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as Seller shall

otherwise agree in writing in advance,

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 104

Purchaser covenants and agrees that Purchaser shall conduct the business of

the OTC Portion in the ordinary and usual course, and use its reasonable

efforts to preserve intact its business and relationships with third

parties. During the period from the date hereof to the Closing, except as

otherwise provided for in this Agreement or as Seller shall otherwise

consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) Purchaser

covenants and agrees that it shall continue to perform its obligations

under the OTC Agreement in accordance with past practice.

Section 5.3 Reasonable Efforts; Good Faith. Seller and

Purchaser will cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts to

fulfill the conditions precedent to the other party's obligations

hereunder, including but not limited to, securing as promptly as

practicable all consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations required in

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In each instance in

which a consent, approval, waiver or authorization cannot be obtained prior

to the Closing Date, Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to enter into

such alternative arrangements and agreements with Purchaser as may be

appropriate in order to permit Purchaser to receive and enjoy substantially

similar rights and benefits and to enable Purchaser to conduct the

Transferred Business until such consent or waiver is obtained. If, after

the exercise of reasonable efforts, any such consent or waiver is not

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 105

obtained, Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser in establishing any

reasonable arrangements designed to provide, to the extent reasonably

practicable, Purchaser with any and all rights of Seller under the relevant

Contracts. Purchaser and Seller will promptly file documentary materials

required by the U.S. Antitrust laws, E.C. Competition law, Environmental

Law and each of the other items listed in Section 3.4 and Section 4.4 and

promptly file any additional information requested as soon as practicable

after receipt of request thereof.

Section 5.4 Tax Matters. (a) Proration of Taxes. Except as

otherwise agreed to by the parties, whenever it is necessary to determine

the liability for Taxes for a portion of a taxable year or period that

begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of the

Taxes for the portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of

the year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by

assuming that the taxable year or period ended at the close of business on

the Closing Date, except that annual property taxes and exemptions,

allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be

prorated on a time basis.

(b) Computation of Tax Liabilities. (i) Whenever it is

necessary to determine the liability of Seller for Taxes, such

determination shall be made as if Seller had computed and paid such Taxes

separate from Kodak.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 106

(ii) Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability of

Purchaser for Taxes, the determination shall be made as if Purchaser had

computed and paid such Taxes separate from any entity owning an interest in

Purchaser (a "Parent Entity").

(iii) Whenever it is necessary to allocate the amount of Taxes

imposed on or with respect to any entity or any asset between the

Transferred Business and any business retained by Seller or the OTC Portion

and any business retained by Purchaser, such allocation shall be made by

allocating all items of expense, loss, deduction, and credit between such

businesses based upon the relative gross income of each such entity

attributable to each such business for the taxable year or period to which

each such item relates.

(c) Tax Returns. (i) Unless otherwise agreed to by the

parties, and except as otherwise appropriate by reason of any portion of

the Transferred Assets not being transferred on the Closing Date, for the

taxable year or period beginning before and ending on or after the Closing

Date, (A) Kodak or Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due all U.S.

Federal and U.S. state and local Tax Returns with respect to Taxes which

constitute Excluded Liabilities and (B) Purchaser shall file or cause to be

filed when due all Tax Returns (whether imposed by any national, state,

departmental, provincial, local or other jurisdiction) with respect to

Taxes which constitute Assumed

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 107

Liabilities. To the extent permitted by law or administrative 
practice,

the taxable year of each corporate or unincorporated entity which

constitutes a Transferred Asset shall be treated as closing at the close of

the Closing Date.

(ii) If either party shall be liable hereunder for any portion

of the Tax shown due on any Tax Returns required to be filed by the other

party, the party preparing such Tax Return (the "Preparer") shall deliver a

copy of the relevant portions of such Tax Return to the party so liable

(the "Payor") for its review and approval, which may not be unreasonably

withheld, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which such

Tax Returns are due to be filed (taking into account any applicable

extensions) (the "Due Date"). If the Payor objects to any items reflected

on such returns, the parties shall attempt to resolve the disagreement. If

the parties are unable to resolve the disagreement, the dispute shall be

referred to the CPA Firm whose determination shall be binding upon the

parties. The fees and expenses of such CPA Firm shall be borne equally by

Seller and Purchaser. If the dispute has not been resolved or the CPA Firm

has not made its determination prior to the Due Date, the Payor shall pay

to the Preparer the amount requested by the Preparer (the "Requested

Amount"). When the amount due to the Preparer from the Payor in respect of

such Tax Return is finally determined, a settlement payment

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 108

(the "Settlement Payment") shall be made in an amount equal to the

Requested Amount minus the amount finally determined to be due, from the

Preparer to the Payor if the Settlement Payment is a positive number, and

from the Payor to the Preparer if the Settlement Payment is a negative

number.

(iii) Purchaser shall cause the entities constituting

Transferred Assets organized under the laws of Brazil, Argentina, U.K.,

Japan and Mexico, Sanofi Winthrop PHARMA and any other corporate entity the

shares of which are transferred to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser

pursuant to Section 2.12 hereto not to take any action described in the

following sentence during the period beginning on the Closing Date and

ending on December 31, 1994. The actions referred to in the prior sentence

shall include only the following: selling (including a deemed sale

pursuant to Section 338 of the Code or a similar law of any other country),

exchanging, distributing, reorganizing or otherwise disposing of the stock

of any subsidiary corporation, disposing of any other property the sale of

which produces personal holding company income within the meaning of

Section 954(a)(1) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and making

any distribution to shareholders in excess of current earnings and profits

as computed for U.S. Federal income tax purposes derived during the period

beginning on the day following the Closing Date and ending on the first

December 31 thereafter.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 109

(iv) All Tax Returns referred to in Section 5.4(c)(i) shall be

prepared and income, gain, expenses, losses, deductions and credits in

respect of such returns shall be calculated in a manner consistent with

prior years unless Kodak or Seller obtains the consent of Purchaser or

Purchaser obtains the consent of Kodak to do otherwise, which consent shall

not be unreasonably withheld in either case.

(d) Information to be Provided by Purchaser. With respect to

Tax Returns to be filed by Kodak or Seller pursuant to Section 5.4(c)(i)(A)

hereof, Purchaser shall promptly, following the end of the taxable year

beginning before and ending on or after the Closing Date, prepare and

provide to Seller a package of tax information materials (the "Tax

Package"), which shall be completed in accordance with past practice,

including past practice as to providing the information, schedules and work

papers and as to the method of computation of separate taxable income or

other relevant measures of income of the Seller.

(e) Contest Provisions. Each of Purchaser, Kodak and Seller

(the "Recipient") shall promptly notify each other party or parties whose

liability for Taxes (including any such liability assumed pursuant to this

Agreement and any obligation to indemnify any person in respect of such

Taxes pursuant to Article VII of this Agreement may be materially affected

thereby (each, an "Affected Party") in

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 110

writing upon receipt by the Recipient, of notice of any pending or

threatened audits or assessments with respect to Taxes (the "Audited

Taxes"). For purposes of this Section 5.4(e), the term "Affected Party"

shall include a party whose Tax liability in respect of any period

subsequent to the period or periods in which such Audited Taxes arose may

be materially affected in any manner (including the reduction of asset

basis or cost adjustments, the reduction of credit carryovers, the

imposition of tax deficiencies and the increase of taxable income) by such

audit or assessment. The party liable for the Audited Taxes pursuant to

Article II of this Agreement shall control the complete defense of the

interests of itself and each Affected Party in any tax audit or

administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes. Each Affected Party

shall be entitled to participate at its expense in such defense and to

employ counsel of its choice at its expense. No Affected Party may agree

to settle any claim for such Audited Taxes without the prior written con-

sent of each other Affected Party, which may not be unreasonably withheld.

(f) Allocation of Consideration. The parties to this

Agreement agree to determine the amount of and allocate the total

consideration transferred by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to this Agreement

(the "Consideration") in accordance with the fair market value of the

assets and liabilities transferred. Kodak, Seller and Purchaser shall

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 111

each prepare one or more schedules determining and allocating the

Consideration and shall negotiate in good faith to reconcile such

schedules. If the Purchaser and Kodak cannot agree on a mutually

acceptable determination, allocation or determination and allocation of the

Consideration, Purchaser and Seller shall each determine, allocate or

determine and allocate, as the case may be, such Consideration in the

manner it considers appropriate. Seller and Purchaser each agree to

prepare and file an IRS Form 8594 in a timely fashion in accordance with

the rules under Section 1060 of the Code. To the extent that the

Consideration is adjusted after the Closing Date, the parties agree to

revise and amend the schedule and IRS Form 8594 in the same manner and

according to the same procedure. Any determination, allocation or

determination and allocation of the Consideration agreed upon by the

Parties pursuant to the second sentence of this subsection shall be binding

on Kodak, Seller and Purchaser for all tax reporting purposes.

(g) Employee Withholding and Reporting Matters. With respect

to the Transferred Employees, Purchaser shall, in accordance with and to

the extent permitted pursuant to Revenue Procedure 84-77, 1984-2 C.B. 753,

assume all responsibility for preparing and filing Form W-2, Wage and Tax

Statement, Form W-3, Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements, Form 941,

Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 112

Return, Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, and Form W-

5, Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate. Seller and Purchaser

agree to comply with the procedures described in Section 5 of Revenue

Procedure 84-77.

(h) Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, transfer,

(including real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing,

recordation and other similar taxes which may be imposed or assessed as the

result of (i) the transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Purchaser or an

Affiliate of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) the transfer of

the OTC Portion to Seller pursuant to this Agreement (the "Transfer

Taxes"), together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect

thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties shall be

borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. Any Tax Returns that must be filed

in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared by the party primarily

or customarily responsible under the applicable local law for filing such

Tax Returns which will use its reasonable best efforts to provide such Tax

Returns to the other parties at least 10 days prior to the date such Tax

Returns are due to be filed. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent

with the allocation of the Consideration pursuant to Section 5.4(f) hereof.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 113

(i) Foreign Tax Receipts. Purchaser shall deliver to the tax

director of Kodak certified copies of all receipts for any foreign Tax with

respect to which Kodak or Seller could claim a foreign tax credit, and any

other documentation required in connection with Seller or Kodak claiming or

supporting a claim for such foreign tax credits promptly following either a

request by Kodak for such receipts or documentation or payment of any such

foreign Taxes by Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser or any other party

to whom Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser transfers any portion of the

Transferred Assets. To the extent Purchaser transfers any equity interests

constituting a 50% or greater interest in any entity constituting a

Transferred Asset to a party or parties unrelated to Purchaser (each, an

"Rx Buyer"), Purchaser shall be relieved of the obligation described in the

preceding sentence to the extent that Purchaser obtains the written

agreement of the Rx Buyer to fulfill Purchaser's obligations pursuant to

the preceding sentence with respect to any taxes paid by Purchaser prior to

such transfer or by an Rx Buyer after such transfer.

(j) Assistance and Cooperation. The parties agree that,

after the Closing Date:

(A) The parties shall assist (and cause their respective

Affiliates to assist) the other parties in preparing any Tax Returns

with respect to the Business

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 114

which such other parties are responsible for preparing and filing;

(B) The parties shall cooperate fully in preparing for any

audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax

Returns and payments in respect thereof;

(C) The parties shall make available to each other and to any

taxing authority as reasonably requested all relevant Books and

Records relating to Taxes;

(D) The parties shall provide timely notice to the other in

writing of any pending or proposed audits or assessments with respect

to Taxes for which the other may have a liability under this

Agreement;

(E) Each party shall furnish the other with copies of all

relevant correspondence received from any taxing authority in

connection with any audit or information request with respect to any

Taxes referred to in subsection (D) above; and

(F) The party requesting assistance or cooperation shall bear

the other party's out-of-pocket expenses in complying with such

request to the extent that those expenses are attributable to fees

and other costs of unaffiliated third-party service providers.

(k) The Purchaser will not make an election pursuant to

Section 338 of the Code or a similar law of any

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 115

other country with respect to any corporation transferred pursuant to

Section 2.12 hereof which is not a U.S. corporation, unless such election

is needed by Purchaser in order to avoid taking a carryover basis, for U.S.

Federal income tax purposes, in assets directly acquired from Seller or an

Affiliate of Seller.

Section 5.5 Post-Closing Obligations of the Business to

Certain Employees. (a) Purchaser shall offer employment in comparable

positions to all Transferred Employees on the Closing Date or upon the

return of any such Transferred Employee to active employment, and will

maintain for a period of two years after the Closing Date, without

interruption, employee compensation and benefit plans, programs and

policies and fringe benefits (including post-employment welfare benefits)

that, in the aggregate, will provide benefits to Transferred Employees

that, in the good faith judgment of Purchaser, are no less favorable than

those provided pursuant to such employee benefit plans, programs and

policies, and fringe benefits, of the Business as in effect on the Closing

Date and listed on Schedule 3.10(a) and designated therein as a Section

5.5(a) plan; provided, however, that the requirements of this sentence

shall not apply to: (i) Transferred Employees who are covered by a

collective bargaining agreement, (ii) benefits the value of which is based

on the value of the securities of Kodak or Seller or which gave Transferred

Employees the

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 116

right to purchase securities of Kodak or Seller, (iii) benefits which vest,

or the payment of which is accelerated or increased in amount, upon a

change in control of Kodak, Seller or Purchaser, or (iv) benefits or

changes therein mandated by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

for a period of two years after the Closing Date, Purchaser will provide to

each Transferred Employee (other than a Transferred Employee covered by a

collective bargaining agreement) severance pay and benefits which are no

less favorable than under Seller's severance plans, programs and policies

as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on Schedule 3.10(a)

and designated as a Section 5.5(a) severance plan, other than with respect

to Seller's "Employee Protection Plan" or any other benefit plan, program

or arrangement that provides benefits upon a change in control of Kodak.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, Transferred Employees shall be

given credit for all service with Seller or any subsidiary (or service

credited by Seller or any subsidiary) under all employee benefit plans,

programs and policies, and fringe benefits of the Business or Purchaser in

which they become participants for purposes of eligibility, vesting and

benefit accrual to the same extent as if rendered to Purchaser; provided,

however, that nothing herein shall require Purchaser to provide duplicate

benefits for the same period of service. In addition, and notwithstanding

the foregoing, Purchaser will

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 117

assume the responsibility to pay, and shall provide to, Transferred

Employees the benefits due and owing under the SWPRD relocation program and

other Sterling Winthrop Inc. relocation programs and listed on Schedule

3.10(a).

(b) "Transferred Employees" means all of the following

Employees:

(i) Except as specifically agreed to between Seller and

Purchaser, all active Employees of (A) Sanofi Winthrop Territory B, (B)

Sterling Winthrop's research division, (C) Sterling Organics and (D)

Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals Group headquarters, and in each case,

their subsidiaries;

(ii) Sterling Winthrop K.K.'s active pharmaceutical Employees

in Japan; and

(iii) those members of Seller's corporate staff as agreed by

Purchaser and Seller prior to Closing.

For purposes of (A)-(D) in subsection (i) above and of

subsection (ii) above, Employees shall be considered active even though on

the Closing Date, they are (x) on temporary leave for purposes of jury or

annual two-week national service/military duty; (y) on Nonmedical Leave of

absence; provided, however, that no such Employee shall be guaranteed

reinstatement to active service if his return to employment is contrary to

the terms of his leave, unless otherwise required by applicable law; or (z)

on disability or medical leave and for whom it has been 180 calendar days

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 118

or less since their last day of active employment; provided, however, that

no such Employee shall be guaranteed reinstatement to active service if he

is incapable of working in accordance with the policies, practices and

procedures of Purchaser.

(c) (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall

establish one or more defined contribution plans (the "Transferee Savings

Plans") for the benefit of Transferred Employees and Former Employees who

were participants in the Eastman Kodak Employees' Savings and Investment

Plan, the Sterling Winthrop Inc. Salaried Employees' Savings Plan and the

Sterling Winthrop Inc. Hourly Employees' Savings Plan (the "Seller Savings

Plans"). Such Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the

"Savings Plan Employees".

Kodak and Seller shall cause to be transferred from the Seller

Savings Plans to the Transferee Savings Plans the liability for the account

balances of the Savings Plan Employees, together with assets (the form of

which shall be agreed to by the parties) the fair market value of which is

equal to such liability, and Purchaser shall cause the Transferee Savings

Plans to accept such transfers. The transfer of assets shall take place

within 90 days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event

shall such transfer take place until the later of (i) the furnishing to

Seller by Purchaser of a favorable determination letter from

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 119

the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the qualification of the

Transferee Savings Plans under Section 401(a) of the Code, and (ii) the

receipt by Seller of favorable determination letters from the Internal

Revenue Service with respect to the continued qualification of the Seller

Savings Plans under Section 401(a) of the Code, as amended to comply with

changes to the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code

made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and other recent legislation and

regulations.

(ii) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall amend,

effective as of the Closing Date, the Sterling Winthrop Inc. Pension Plan

for Hourly Employees and the Sterling Winthrop Inc. International Chemical

Workers Union Pension Plan for Hourly Employees (the "Assumed Pension

Plans") to make Purchaser (or a subsidiary thereof) the "plan sponsor" (as

such term is defined in Section 3(16) of ERISA) thereof. Seller will make

appropriate amendments to the Assumed Pension Plans and the trust

agreements thereunder to implement such change of plan sponsor. Seller

shall take all other actions necessary to enable Purchaser (or a subsidiary

thereof) to assume, and Purchaser hereby agrees to assume (or cause a

subsidiary to assume), all benefit liabilities and obligations with respect

to the Assumed Pension Plans. Seller shall, not later than 90 days after

the Closing Date, cause the trustee of the trust under

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 120

each Assumed Pension Plan to transfer to a trustee designated by Purchaser

all of the assets of such Plan. To the extent the assets are held in a

master trust, the transfer shall be made in the form of cash or cash

equivalents, or such marketable securities as the parties may agree. From

the date hereof to the date of such transfer (or if the assets are not held

in a master trust, the Closing Date), Seller shall not, and shall not

permit the trustee of any Assumed Pension Plan to, make any significant

changes in the investment policy in connection with the management of the

assets of such Plans.

(iii) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall

establish one or more defined benefit plans (the "Transferee Pension

Plans") for the benefit of Retirement Plan Employees (as defined below) who

participated in the Kodak Retirement Income Plan and the Sterling Products

International Inc. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees who are Employed at

Facilities Located in Puerto Rico (the "Seller Retirement Plans"). For

purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement Plan Employees" means the

Transferred Employees, the Former Employees (other than Former Employees of

the Seller's L&F Division and Former Employees who are continuing to accrue

a benefit under the Seller Retirement Plans) and the applicable

beneficiaries thereof. The Transferee Pension Plans shall (A) recognize

for all purposes thereunder the service of the Retirement Plan

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 121

Employees which was recognized under the Seller Retirement Plans and (B)

provide, upon the transfer of assets referred to below, that the benefit

liabilities of the Retirement Plans Employees under the Transferee Pension

Plans shall in no event be less than their benefit liabilities under the

Seller Retirement Plans as of the Closing Date.

With respect to each Seller Retirement Plan, Seller shall cause

to be transferred from the trust under such Seller Retirement Plan to the

trust under the Transferee Pension Plan assets, the value of which shall be

equal to the lesser of (x) the sum of (1) the "accumulated benefit

obligation" (as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

No. 87) of the Retirement Plan Employees under such Seller Retirement Plan

as of the Closing Date, calculated using the actuarial assumptions that

were used in preparing the audited financial statements of Kodak and the

Seller for the year ended December 31, 1993, except that the interest rate

assumption shall be equal to the sum of (A) the yield to maturity of 30-

year U.S. Treasury bonds on the Closing Date and (B) 75 basis points (such

sum is herein referred to as the "Interest Rate") and (2) interest on the

amount determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i) calculated at the

Interest Rate, compounded daily, for the period from and including the

Closing Date to, but excluding, the actual date of transfer or (y) the

maximum amount permitted to be transferred in

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 122

accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code. With respect to each 
Seller

Retirement Plan, the excess, if any, of the amount described in clause (x)

of the preceding sentence over the amount described in clause (y) therein,

is referred to herein as the "Pension Shortfall Amount".

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding

paragraph, if the minimum amount required to be transferred in accordance

with Section 414(l) of the Code exceeds the amount described in clause (x)

of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph (such excess being

referred to as the "Pension Excess"), then Seller shall cause such minimum

amount to be transferred from the trust under the applicable Seller

Retirement Plan to the trust under the Transferee Pension Plan. Purchaser

shall cause the Transferee Pension Plans to accept such transfers.

The amount to be transferred shall be equitably adjusted to

take into account benefit payments made from the Seller Retirement Plans to

the Retirement Plan Employees after the Closing Date but prior to the date

of transfer. The amounts under the preceding two paragraphs shall be

determined jointly by the respective actuaries for the Seller Retirement

Plan and the Transferee Pension Plan.

The transfer of assets referred to above shall take place

within 180 days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event

shall such transfer take place until the last to occur of the following:

(i) Purchaser has

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 123

furnished to Seller a favorable determination letter from the Internal

Revenue Service with respect to the qualification of the applicable

Transferee Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, (ii) the receipt

by Seller of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue

Service with respect to the continued qualification of the applicable

Seller Retirement Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, as amended to

(A) comply with changes to the qualification requirements of Section 401(a)

of the Code made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and other recent legislation

and regulations and (B) provide for the transfer of assets and benefit

liabilities referred to in this Section, and (iii) the receipt of any other

necessary governmental approval. Such transfer shall be made in the form

of such readily marketable securities as the parties shall agree.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the

contrary, (A) in the event that the Internal Revenue Service or any other

governmental agency takes the position in a determination letter, ruling,

advisory opinion or other written or oral communication that the transfer

of assets referred to in this Section cannot be made unless (i) additional

contributions are made to a Seller Retirement Plan or a Transferee Pension

Plan or (ii) a Seller Retirement Plan retains primary or secondary

liability with respect to the benefit liabilities under such Seller

Retirement Plan attributable to Transferred Retirement Plan

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 124

Employees or (B) in the event that a lawsuit is instituted by any of the

foregoing or by one or more participants in, or fiduciaries (other than

Seller, Kodak or Purchaser) of, a Seller Retirement Plan or a Transferee

Pension Plan which seeks to enjoin such transfer, to require additional

contributions to a Seller Retirement Plan or Transferee Pension Plan, or to

have a Seller Retirement Plan remain liable in whole or in part with

respect to any of the benefit liabilities under such Seller Retirement Plan

attributable to Transferred Retirement Plan Employees, then the transfer of

assets referred to in this Section from such Seller Retirement Plan will

not be made until the earliest of (I) the date the issues raised by the

Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency or such lawsuit

are resolved favorably, and Seller, Kodak and the Seller Retirement Plan

shall make every effort in good faith to carry out the asset transfer,

including, but not limited to, the vigorous defense of any lawsuit

described in clause (B), and the exhaustion of all rights of available

judicial review and appeal, or (II) the date Seller and Purchaser or Kodak

and Purchaser, as applicable, enter into a written agreement to resolve on

a basis mutually satisfactory to them the issues raised by the Internal

Revenue Service or any other governmental agency or such lawsuit. In the

event of any delay beyond two years from the Closing Date of the transfer

of assets and liabilities from a Seller Retirement

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 125

Plan by reason of the preceding sentence, Kodak shall hold Purchaser

harmless from any economic loss resulting from such delay. Furthermore, if

such transfer has not occurred by the fourth anniversary of the Closing

Date by reason of the second preceding sentence, then there shall be no

transfer of such assets and liabilities and Purchaser shall have no

obligations under this Section 5.5(c)(iii), including the obligation to

recognize service of the Retirement Plan Employees under the Transferee

Pension Plan.

(iv) Pending the completion of the transfers described in this

paragraph (c), Seller and Purchaser shall make arrangements for any

required payments (A) to the Savings Plan Employees and the Retirement Plan

Employees from the Seller Savings Plans and the Seller Retirement Plans and

(B) to participants and beneficiaries in the Assumed Pension Plans. Seller

and Purchaser shall provide each other with access to information

reasonably necessary in order to carry out the provisions of this paragraph

and shall otherwise cooperate in the administration of said Plans for the

benefit of the Transferred Employees and Former Employees.

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, all Transferred

Employees shall cease to be covered by Seller's employee welfare benefit

plans, including plans, programs, policies and arrangements which provide

medical and dental coverage, life and accident insurance, disability

coverage,

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 126

and vacation and severance pay (collectively, "Welfare Plans"), except to

the extent provided otherwise by the applicable Welfare Plan. Seller shall

retain responsibility for, and sole liability in respect of, providing

group health coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601

of ERISA ("Continuation Coverage") under the terms of the health plan

maintained by Seller to (i) Employees of Seller who were employed in

connection with the Business, who terminated employment prior to the

Closing Date and who elected such Continuation Coverage or (ii) Employees

of Seller who are employed in connection with the Business and who are

entitled to such Continuation Coverage as a result of the transactions

U.S. Transferred Employees of the Business on the Closing Date, and the

denominator of which is equal to the number of U.S. active employees of

Seller and all of its subsidiaries on the Closing Date. (The determination

of whether an employee is an active employee shall be determined using the

a Dual Product as an Over-the-Counter Human Pharmaceutical Product in any

country, (x) Purchaser shall be prohibited from manufacturing, marketing,

selling or distributing such Dual Product in such country as an Over-the-

Counter Human Pharmaceutical Product (it being understood that Purchaser

may continue to manufacture, market, sell and distribute such product as an

Ethical Human Pharmaceutical Product in such jurisdiction), provided,

Purchaser shall have the right to cause a Dual Product to become an Over-

the-Counter Human Pharmaceutical Product in any territory if Purchaser has

indemnity with respect to Rensselaer Site I to a third party without the

prior written consent of Kodak, such consent not to be unreasonably

withheld, (iii) Purchaser shall comply with the

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 175

requirements of the Agreement and Determination effective December 1, 
1983,

Index Number T110783, between Sterling Drug, Inc. and the New York State

Department of Environmental Conservation ("NYSDEC") concerning Rensselaer

maintain a cooperative working relationship with the NYSDEC with respect to

activities at Rensselaer Site I. Kodak's and Seller's payments under this

Section shall be reduced and/or refunded by an amount equal to any

recoveries benefiting Purchaser or its assigns under pre-Closing insurance

Section 7.4 Indemnification Procedures. With respect to third

party claims other than those relating to Taxes, all claims for

indemnification by any Indemnified Party hereunder shall be asserted and

resolved as set forth in this Section 7.4. In the event that any written

claim or demand for which an indemnifying party, Seller, Kodak or Purchaser

as the case may be (an "Indemnifying Party") would be liable to any

Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected

from any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall

promptly, but in no event more than 15 days following such Indemnified

Party's receipt of such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Party of

such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the

extent then feasible

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 176

(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim

and demand) (the "Claim Notice"). The Indemnifying Party shall have 90

days from the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the "Notice

Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (a) whether or not the

Indemnifying Party disputes the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the

Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand and

(b) whether or not it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such

claim or demand. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party

in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be

paid by, the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the amount of such

costs and expenses that shall be a liability of the Indemnifying Party

hereunder shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.2(b)

and 7.3(b) hereof. Except as hereinafter provided, in the event that the

Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period

that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or

demand, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the

Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power

to direct and control such defense. If any Indemnified Party desires to

participate in any such defense it may do so at its sole cost and expense.

The Indemnified Party shall not settle a claim or demand without the

consent of the Indemnifying Party. The

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 177

Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of 
the

Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any

such claim or demand on a basis which would result in the imposition of a

consent order, injunction or decree which would restrict the future

activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any subsidiary or affiliate

thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified

Party against such claim or demand, whether by not giving the Indemnified

Party timely notice as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any

such claim or demand, or, if the same be contested by the Indemnified

Party, then that portion thereof as to which such defense is unsuccessful

(and the reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to such defense) shall be

the liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, subject to the

limitations set forth in Sections 7.2(b) and 7.3(b) hereof. To the extent

the Indemnifying Party shall direct, control or participate in the defense

or settlement of any third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party

will give the Indemnifying Party and its counsel access to, during normal

business hours, the relevant business records and other documents, and

shall permit them to consult with the employees and counsel of the

Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall use its best efforts in the

defense of all such claims.

Section 7.5 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All

amounts paid by Seller, Kodak or Purchaser, as the case may be, under

Article II and this Article VII (other than payments contemplated by

Section 2.5(b) or Section 2.9(b) hereof), to the extent relating to any

period ending on or before the Closing shall be treated as included in, or

as adjustments to, the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. To the extent

that any amount described in the preceding sentence is not treated as

included in, or as an adjustment to, the Purchase Price for Tax purposes in

any applicable Taxing jurisdiction, the amount of the Loss being

indemnified for shall be reduced by any net Tax savings actually realized

by the indemnified party by reason of such Loss and increased by any net

Tax costs actually incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the

receipt of such amount. Any contest affecting the determination of such

Tax costs and Tax Savings shall be subject to the provisions of Section

5.4(e).

Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or

waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Purchaser,

Seller and Kodak, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the

waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 183

and Kodak may assign all or any portion of their respective rights and

obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the OTC Owner, provided that such

assignment is not inconsistent with the means of transfer agreed by the

assigning party shall remain jointly and severally liable for the

performance of the obligations hereunder that are so assigned. In

connection with any assignment pursuant to this Section 9.3 and any offer

by Kodak to sell the stock of Seller, copies of this Agreement may be

provided to the assignee or offeree, as the case may be, subject to

appropriate confidentiality provisions and to the deletion of information

relating to such matters as Purchaser, Seller and Kodak may agree.

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify Kodak, Seller and their

Affiliates against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, claim,

<PAGE>

or fulfilled by the such party.

matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement.
