BANKAMERICA SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS

SAN FRANCISCO, July 20, 1994 -- BankAmerica Corporation today
reported second-quarter earnings per share of $1.33, an increase of
11 percent from $1.20 for the same period a year ago. Net income for
the second quarter of 1994 was $525 million, up 8 percent from the second 
quarter of 1993. 

"We are very pleased with the second-quarter increase in earnings
per share, which is the result of good performance in many business
sectors," Richard M. Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
said. "Second-quarter earnings per share not only exceeded the results 
for the second quarter of 1993, but also represented an increase over 
first-quarter 1994 results of $1.27, as loan growth contributed to 
increased net interest income, and trading income improved. These 
results reflect the continuing efforts of our dedicated staff 
to realize the value in the diversity of the franchise, which we have 
been increasing in the past several years."

The corporation's earnings per share for the first six months of
1994 were $2.59, based on year-to-date net income of $1,038 million,
while earnings per share for the first six months of 1993 were $2.39,
based on year-to-date net income of $972 million.

Results of Operations
---------------------

Net interest income for the second quarter of 1994 was down 
$20 million, or 1 percent, from the amount reported for the second 
quarter of 1993, but up $38 million from the previous quarter. The
corporation's net interest margin for the second quarter of 1994 was
4.49 percent, down 23 basis points from the same period last year, but
up slightly from the first quarter of 1994.

The provision for credit losses was $125 million in the second
quarter of 1994, down $102 million from the amount reported in the
second quarter of 1993. This decrease primarily reflected continued
improvement in credit quality in various portfolio sectors. 

Noninterest income for the second quarter of 1994 decreased 
$40 million from the amount reported in the same period last year, 
primarily due to decreases in both trading income and total fees and 
commissions. These declines were partially offset by an increase in 
other income, the largest component of which was gains on sales of assets 
pending disposition. 

Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 1994 remained
essentially unchanged from the amount reported in the comparable period
of 1993. Included in second-quarter 1994 noninterest expense were
previously disclosed capital additions totaling $68 million to two of
the Pacific Horizon money market mutual funds, for which Bank of America
NT&SA serves as investment advisor. Excluding this amount, noninterest
expense for the second quarter of 1994 was down $73 million from the
corresponding period in 1993.

Balance Sheet Analysis
----------------------

Average total loans for the second quarter of 1994 were up 
$1.0 billion from the previous quarter. Adjusted for certain
reclassifications, average loan outstandings have increased for three
consecutive quarters.

<PAGE>

Credit quality continued to improve during the second quarter of
1994. Total nonaccrual assets decreased $276 million, or 11 percent,
from their March 31, 1994 level. This decline, which was primarily in 
nonaccrual commercial and industrial and construction and development 
loans, was largely the result of paydowns and loans restored to accrual 
status. In addition, net credit losses for the second quarter of 1994 
totaled $154 million, down $197 million, or 56 percent, from the amount 
reported in the same period last year.

During the second quarter of 1994, BankAmerica Corporation completed
its previously announced plan to repurchase common stock in connection
with the pending acquisition of Continental Bank Corporation. During
the six months ended June 30, 1994, the corporation repurchased 
11.8 million shares of its common stock on the open market at an average
per-share price of $42.43.

Financial Highlights

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
was adopted by the corporation effective January 1, 1994. At that
time, $5.6 billion of held-to-maturity securities were transferred
to available-for-sale securities. In addition, certain debt-
restructuring par bonds and other instruments issued by foreign
governments of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion were reclassified from
loans to available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity
securities, respectively. 

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39 (FIN 39),
"Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts," was also
adopted by the corporation effective January 1, 1994. To the extent
allowed by FIN 39, the corporation nets unrealized gains and losses
on certain off-balance-sheet instruments. 

Since SFAS No. 115 does not allow retroactive application and the
corporation has elected not to restate prior periods under FIN 39,
prior period amounts have not been restated.

/a/ Due to the first-quarter 1993 adoption of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes", core deposit intangibles (CDI)
and other identifiable intangibles that are normally deducted
from Tier 1 capital under the current guidelines of the
federal banking regulators were estimated to be $489 million
higher at June 30, 1994 and were $500 million higher at
March 31, 1994 and $535 million higher at June 30, 1993,with
corresponding increases in deferred taxes. The federal banking
regulators have not issued final capital regulations on the
adoption of SFAS No. 109 and are currently considering whether
such increased intangibles should be deducted from
capital. Management believes that the increased amounts of CDI
and other identifiable intangibles resulting from the adoption
of SFAS No. 109 do not pose a risk to the corporation's
capital and should not be deducted from capital in determining
capital ratios. Pending final resolution of this issue by the
banking regulators, such amounts have not been deducted from
capital in determining the capital ratios shown above.
