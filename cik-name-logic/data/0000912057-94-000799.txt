Item 5. Other Events.

On March 3, 1994, Acme Metals Incorporated (the "Company") agreed to
sell an issue of securities at a price of $21.00 per security on a private
placement basis exclusively in Canada. Within 160 days of the closing of this
transaction (expected on March 10, 1994), the securities will be exchangeable on
a one for one basis, subject to certain conditions, for 5,000,000 common shares
of the Company (5,600,000 common shares if an over-allotment option for the
securities is exercised). Conditions for the exchange of the special warrants
for common stock include confirmation of the availability of debt financing
sufficient for the construction of a continuous thin slab caster/hot strip mill
and approval of such construction by Acme's Board of Directors.

The securities and the underlying common shares have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and may not be offered
or sold in the United States or to a U.S. person, as defined in Regulation S
under the Securities Act, absent registration or an applicable exemption from
registration requirements.
