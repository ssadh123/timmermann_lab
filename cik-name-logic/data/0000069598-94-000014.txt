NALCO TAKES CHARGE FOR JOINT VENTURE AND RESTRUCTURING

Naperville, Ill., September 1, 1994...Nalco Chemical Company
announced today the completion of its agreement with Exxon
Chemical Company to form a worldwide energy chemicals joint
venture company, to be known as Nalco/Exxon Energy
Chemicals, L.P. The two companies previously announced
their intent to form this joint venture on February 3, 1994,
with the goal of providing specialty chemical products and
services to the petroleum industry worldwide.

The Company also announced a worldwide restructuring and
consolidation of manufacturing and support operations aimed
at achieving greater efficiencies and enhanced customer
satisfaction.

Nalco will take an after-tax charge of approximately $54
million, or 70 cents per share, against 1994 earnings, for
expenses related to the formation of the joint venture
company and Nalco's restructuring and consolidation efforts.

The formation of Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals, L.P.,
combines the strengths of both parent corporations in a
worldwide company serving the oil industry, according to E.
J. Mooney, Nalco Chief Executive Officer. Nalco and Exxon
Chemical will each commit resources of facilities and people
to the joint venture, which was formed in response to
changes in the worldwide petroleum industry, he added.

Nalco expects to reduce its total number of employees by
approximately 1300, about 20 percent of its overall
workforce. About 900 of these employees will be employed by
the joint venture, and about 400 will be provided with
severance packages as a result of consolidating Nalco's
operations around the world.

In the United States, Nalco will transfer production from a
plant on the south side of Chicago to a nearby plant in the
clearing industrial district. Several international
manufacturing and support operations will also be affected
by the consolidation effort.

Additionally, Nalco will regionalize on a pan-European basis
certain support functions in order to more efficiently serve
its customers with a strong local presence in all countries
in which it does business.

Nalco is the world's largest specialty chemical company for
industrial water, process and wastewater treatment.

NALCO AND EXXON CHEMICAL LAUNCH ENERGY CHEMICALS JOINT
VENTURE

Naperville, Ill., September 1, 1994...Nalco Chemical Company
and Exxon Chemical Company, a division of Exxon Corporation,
announced today that they have formed a joint venture to
provide specialty chemical products and services to the
petroleum and chemical industries. The new company, named
Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals, L.P., is headquartered in
Sugar Land, Texas and will operate on a worldwide basis once
the remaining governmental and regulatory approvals have
been obtained in a few countries. John R. Sutley, former
Nalco Group Vice President and President of Nalco Europe,
has been named President and CEO of the new company.

The joint venture includes Nalco's U.S. Petroleum Chemicals
Division business units, certain petroleum chemicals
segments of Nalco's international operations and Exxon
Chemical Company's Energy Chemicals business. The joint
venture provides products and services used in oil
exploration, production, distribution and refining; gas
exploration, production and transmission; and chemical
process industry applications. Projected annual revenues
exceed $400 million.

Commenting on the move, E. J. Mooney, Nalco President, CEO
and Chairman of the Board, stated, "Because the joint
venture will be able to focus exclusively on opportunities
in the petroleum market around the world, it helps us better
meet the needs of our customers. The joint venture greatly
strengthens our capability to address these needs through an
expanded network of experienced people, state-of-the-art
technology and consultative services. We're both confident
and enthusiastic about the future of the joint venture."

"The formation of this joint venture is a logical evolution
in our energy chemicals business to provide total service to
customers anywhere in the world," says Ray B. Nesbitt,
President, Exxon Chemical Company. "Based on the past seven
months of work to form this joint venture, we are confident
of the Nalco and Exxon Chemical synergies in technology,
product offerings and manufacturing operations which serve
as its foundation for growth," he added.

Nalco Chemical Company is a worldwide producer of specialty
chemicals and services for industrial water, process and
wastewater treatment with 1993 sales of $1.4 billion.

Exxon Chemical had sales of about $10 billion in 1993 from
petrochemical manufacturing and marketing operations around
