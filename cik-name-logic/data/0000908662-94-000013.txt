Fleet Financial Group Completes Acquisition
of Sterling Bancshares Corp.

Providence, R.I., August 15, 1994: Fleet Financial Group 
today completed its acquisition of Sterling Bancshares Corp. 
(NASDAQ-STLG), Waltham, Mass., it was announced by Terrence 
Murray, Fleet's chairman and chief executive officer.

Under terms of the acquisition, originally announced last 
October, Fleet acquired the $1-billion parent company of 
Sterling Bank for approximately $125 million in stock, or 
$39.50 for each share of Sterling common stock.

Sterling operates 13 banking offices in eastern 
Massachusetts, predominantly in Middlesex County. They will be 
merged into the $9.2-billion Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, N.A., 
which has 154 branches throughout the state.

Murray terms the Sterling acquisition "a highly attractive 
match" that will help Fleet expand its community lending 
activities involving middle-market companies, as well as its 
consumer banking and investment services businesses, in one of 
New England's most attractive and affluent markets.

The acquisition agreement provides Sterling stockholders 
with 1.096 shares of Fleet Financial Group stock for each 
Sterling share. The transaction will be treated as a pooling 
of interests and is anticipated to be tax-free to Sterling 
shareholders.

Fleet Financial Group is a $48-billion diversified 
financial services company listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE-FLT) with approximately 1,200 offices 
nationwide. Its lines of business include commercial and 
consumer banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, 
asset-based lending, equipment leasing, investment management, 
and student loan processing.
