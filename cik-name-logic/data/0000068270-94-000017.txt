Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On August 8, 1994, the Registrant sold certain education,
business and industry (B&I) contracts and assets of its contract
food-service business to Gardner Merchant Food Services, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Gardner Merchant Ltd., for a cash
payment of $100 million. The Registrant will close the remaining
B&I accounts. The sale of the B&I accounts and the
discontinuance of the remaining accounts is expected to result in
a net pre-tax gain of approximately $35 million. 

The sale of B&I is part of the Registrant's strategy to
invest in high growth businesses that have or can attain a
dominant market position in their respective categories. 
Proceeds from the sale will be used to fund accelerated growth
and for previously authorized share repurchases.
