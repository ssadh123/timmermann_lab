(A) To effect the purchase of Durable, the Company issued 1,015,000 shares of 
its common stock (at a market value of $2.625 per share) and paid 
$1,300,000 in cash. Additionally, Durable issued a note payable in the 
amount of $400,000 and entered into a one year consulting agreement for 
$218,000 with its prior shareholder. The Company also incurred an 
estimated $250,000 in costs in connection with the acquisition, including a 
fee payable to Capital Pacific Homes of $150,000. The total estimated fair
value of the net assets acquired exceeded the total purchase price, 
resulting in negative goodwill of approximately $887,000. See (C) below. 

(B) To adjust to fair value of residential inventories acquired. 

(C) To reduce negative goodwill by fixed assets acquired of $161,000.

(D) Estimated increased cost of sales attributable to adjustment to fair value
of residential inventories acquired.

(E) Amortization of estimated negative goodwill.

(F) Reduction of depreciation expense attributable to negative goodwill
allocated to fixed assets.

(G) Loss of interest income on $1,300,000 cash payment.

(H) The income tax expense reflects C corporation taxes reduced by the
applicable net operating loss available from the Company to partially 
offset such taxes.

The pro forma data has been prepared assuming that the acquisition had
occured on the pro forma balance sheet date or, for the pro forma statements of
operations, March 1, 1992. The pro forma adjustments are based upon
available information and certain assumptions that management believes are
reasonable. The pro forma financial information does not purport to represent
what the Company's financial position or results of operations would actually
have been had the acquisition in fact occurred on the assumed date or at the
beginning of the period indicated or to project the Company's financial
position or results of operations for any future date or period.
