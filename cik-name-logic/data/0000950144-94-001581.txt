BLOCKBUSTER BOARD REAFFIRMS APPROVAL
OF VIACOM MERGER; SETS SEPTEMBER 29
SHAREHOLDER MEETING DATE

NEW YORK, NY, August 23, 1994 - Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation
(NYSE: BV) announced today that its Board of Directors has unanimously
reaffirmed its approval of Blockbuster's proposed merger with Viacom Inc. (ASE:
VIA) and has set September 29, 1994 as the date for the special meeting at
which Blockbuster's shareholders will consider and vote on the merger. The
Board also fixed August 31 as the record date for the meeting.

The Blockbuster Board's action comes as a result of the significant
improvement in Viacom's stock prices in recent months, Viacom's completion of
its acquisition of Paramount Communications Inc., its strong second quarter
results and the divestitures it is considering, as well as the Blockbuster
Board's continuing belief in the strategic benefits of the proposed combination
and the long-term prospects of the combined entity.

Commenting on today's Board action, H. Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: "It's been a long and sometimes
bumpy road, but we still believe today that the combination of Blockbuster with
Viacom and Paramount represents an excellent strategic opportunity that will
create a fully-integrated, global entertainment and communications company with
extraordinary resources and opportunities for future growth for both our
shareholders and employees."

Mr. Huizenga continued: "At times since we first announced this deal, as
we watched the prices for Viacom stock decline, we were concerned that the
market did not

fully understand and appreciate the strategic benefits that will result from
the combination of these three outstanding companies."

He added: "We are pleased with the recent improvement in Viacom's stock
prices. We believe that the combination with Viacom will result in significant
value for our shareholders. In the eight years since we opened our first
Blockbuster store, our market value has increased from approximately $7 million
to approximately $8.5 billion. At the same time, a share of Blockbuster common
stock appreciated by more than 14,000 percent. In just the 12 months prior to
signing our agreement with Viacom, our market value increased by more than $4
billion, or over 110 percent. We are confident that this value will continue
to be enhanced as a result of our combination with Viacom."

As previously announced, in the merger, Blockbuster shareholders will be
entitled to receive for each of their shares: (i) 0.08 of a share of Viacom
Class A Common Stock; (ii) 0.60615 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock;
and (iii) a variable common right representing the right to receive up to an
additional 0.13829 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock depending on
market prices to the Class B stock during the year following the merger.

Blockbuster and Viacom expect that a joint proxy statement/prospectus
relating to the merger will be mailed to stockholders of both companies within
the next several days.
