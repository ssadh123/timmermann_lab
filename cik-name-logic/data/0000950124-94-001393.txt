NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

(1) Gives effect to the deconsolidation of the fiscal year ended January
26, 1994 and the twenty-six weeks ended July 27, 1994 historical
results of operations of the Borders-Walden Group, OfficeMax, Inc. 
and The Sports Authority, Inc.

(2) Gives effect to the sale of 51% of the Borders-Walden Group, OfficeMax,
Inc. and The Sports Authority, Inc. as if they occurred as of January
28, 1993. Because management and the Board of Directors have not yet
determined the actual interest to be sold (at least 51%) or proceeds to
be received, no adjustments to reflect the proceeds of the sales of
these three companies has been reflected in these pro forma 
consolidated statements of income other than to reflect Kmart
Corporation's proportionate income (loss) of the operations of each of 
these three companies. For the fiscal year ended January 26, 1994, and
for the twenty-six week period ended July 27, 1994, the net income
(loss) for these three companies was $(76) million and $1 million,
respectively. Assuming a sale of 51% interest, Kmart Corporation's
proportionate share of the three companies' net income (loss) for the
fiscal year ended January 26, 1994 and the twenty-six week period ended
July 27, 1994 would be $(37) million and $0.49 million, respectively.
Each incremental 10% change in interest over 51% would decrease equity
earnings for the fiscal year ended January 26, 1994 and the twenty-six
weeks ended July 27, 1994 by $8 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

(3) Gives effect to deconsolidation of the Borders-Walden Group, OfficeMax,
Inc. and The Sports Authority, Inc., as of July 27, 1994, excluding the
effect of any proceeds of at least a 51% sale of the Borders-Walden
Group, OfficeMax, Inc., or The Sports Authority, Inc. as the amounts of
proceeds or percentage to be sold has not yet been determined by the
Board of Directors of Kmart Corporation or management. The adjustment
of $1,421 million to Investment in Affiliated Retail Companies
represents the net book value of the Borders-Walden Group, OfficeMax,
Inc. and The Sports Authority, Inc. as of July 27, 1994.
