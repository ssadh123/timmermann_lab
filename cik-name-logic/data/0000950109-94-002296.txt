CoreStates Completes Acquisition of

Germantown Savings Bank

Philadelphia, Pa., December 2, 1994 -- CoreStates Financial Corp today 
completed its previously-announced acquisition of Germantown Savings Bank (GSB) 
of Philadelphia. GSB's 32 branch offices will become part of CoreStates Bank, 
N.A., further strengthening the bank's dominant market share in the five-county 
Philadelphia area. Branch office and systems consolidation are scheduled to take
place late in the first quarter of 1995.

Under terms of the agreement each of GSB's 4.19 million shares will be 
exchanged for cash, CoreStates shares or a combination of cash and shares valued
at $62.00 per share of GSB stock.

With the GSB acquisition, CoreStates is a $29.0 billion assets banking 
services company with branch banking operations in southeastern, northeastern 
and south central Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

CoreStates' banking subsidiaries conduct commercial and correspondent 
banking, trust and consumer banking services through 401 domestic and five 
foreign branches. Other subsidiaries engage in commercial finance and factoring,
discount brokerage, electronic transaction processing, investment banking and 
merchant banking.
