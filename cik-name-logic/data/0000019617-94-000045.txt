New York, April 19 -- Chemical Banking Corporation said
today that continued good performance in its core businesses and
a sharp decline in credit costs in the first quarter led to net
income of $319 million, or $1.13 per common share. These results
were 16 percent higher than earnings on a comparable basis of
$276 million in the first quarter of 1993, before accounting
changes and tax benefits.

Reported net income in last year's first quarter was $374
million, or $1.35 per share, when the corporation benefited from
$98 million in one-time gains, including a net favorable impact
of $35 million from the adoption of new accounting standards and
an income tax benefit of $63 million.

Results for the first quarter of 1994 included a
restructuring charge of $48 million ($28 million after-tax)
related to the previously reported closing of 50 New York
branches and a staff reduction of 650. On an annualized basis,
Chemical expects to save $44 million pre-tax through this
rationalization of its branch system, part of an ongoing,
corporate-wide program to improve productivity.

"The quarter was characterized by major progress in
achieving key financial objectives -- growth in fee-based income,
a lower risk profile, productivity initiatives and a Double A
credit rating," said Walter V. Shipley, chairman and chief
executive officer.

Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service raised its
rating on long-term deposits and other senior obligations of
Chemical Bank to Aa3 from A1. It also raised Chemical Banking
Corporation's ratings on commercial paper, senior debt,
subordinated debt and preferred stock. Chemical Bank's
subordinated debt rating was also upgraded.

Total stockholders' equity at March 31 was $11.0 billion,
up $490 million from $10.5 billion a year ago. The corporation's
estimated Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 8.2 percent at
March 31, compared with 7.5 percent a year ago. At March 31, the
estimated total risk-based capital ratio was 12.3 percent, up
from 11.8 percent a year ago.

<PAGE> 6
NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income for the first quarter was $1.143
billion, compared with $1.149 billion in the same year-ago
period. The net yield on interest-earning assets was 3.59
percent in the first quarter, compared with 3.82 percent in the
year-ago first quarter.

Average interest-earning assets for the first quarter were
$129.8 billion, compared with $122.6 billion in the year-ago
period. The composition of average earning assets continued to
shift in response to growth in liquid assets to support trading
businesses and securities, more than offsetting declines in
loans. While net interest income was only slightly below the
1993 level, the shift to lower-spread liquid assets has exerted
downward pressure on the net yield on interest-earning assets.

In the latest quarter, liquid assets and securities averaged
$55.3 billion, compared with $41.2 billion in 1993. Total loans
averaged $74.5 billion in the first quarter versus $81.4 billion
a year ago.

NONINTEREST REVENUE
Noninterest revenue for the first quarter was $931 million,
up from $925 million in the same period a year ago, despite a $67
million decline in trading revenue.

The results reflected increases in revenues from corporate
finance fees, revolving credit fees, and trust and investment
management fees.

Fees for revolving credit products were $75 million, up 42
percent from $53 million, reflecting the launch of the Shell
MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 1993. Trust and investment
management fees were $110 million, up 12 percent from $98 million
a year ago, as a result of investments made in the personal trust
business.

Combined revenues from all trading activities were $185
million in the first quarter, compared with $252 million in the
same year-ago period. Results from foreign exchange, risk
management products and securities trading were mixed in a
challenging environment, while emerging markets trading was weak.

Corporate finance fees were $82 million, up from $71 million
in the first quarter a year ago.

Other noninterest revenue in the first quarter was $149
million, compared with $116 million in the first quarter a year
ago. The 1994 first quarter included $45 million in net gains
from the sale of LDC-related past due interest and other bonds.
The 1993 first quarter included $56 million in revenue from the
sale of such bonds.

Venture capital revenue increased to $84 million in the
first quarter of 1994 compared with $28 million a year ago.
Securities gains in the first quarter were $46 million, compared
with $70 million in the first quarter of 1993. 
<PAGE>

<PAGE> 7
NONINTEREST EXPENSE
Noninterest expense in the first quarter, including the $48
million restructuring charge, was $1.324 billion, compared with
$1.276 billion in the first quarter of 1993. The 1993 first
quarter results included a one-time restructuring charge of $43
million related to the federally-assisted acquisition in February
1993 of major components of First City Bancorporation of Texas,
Inc. by Chemical's affiliate, Texas Commerce Bancshares.

Excluding the one-time charges, the 3.5 percent increase in
year-over-year non-interest expense is primarily attributable to
approximately $26 million in additional operating expenses
associated with 1993 acquisitions in Texas and approximately $32
million of operating expenses related to the Shell MasterCard. 

Foreclosed property expense in the first quarter decreased
51 percent to $35 million from the 1993 first quarter period
level of $71 million, reflecting significant progress in managing
the corporation's real estate portfolio. Real estate owned
totaled $791 million as of March 31, 1994 compared with $1.119
billion on March 31, 1993. 

For the first quarter, the ratio of noninterest expense
(excluding one-time charges) to total revenue was 61.5 percent,
compared with 59.5 percent in the first quarter a year ago.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES
The provision for losses was $205 million in the first
quarter, compared with $286 million in the fourth quarter of 1993
and $312 million in the first quarter of 1993.

Consumer net charge-offs were $90 million in the first
quarter, compared with $89 million in the fourth quarter and $97
million in the first quarter a year ago. Commercial net charge-
offs were $140 million in the first quarter, compared with $197
million in the fourth quarter and $215 million in the first
quarter of 1993.

Total non-LDC net charge-offs were $230 million in the first
quarter, compared with $286 million in the fourth quarter of 1993
and $312 million in the first quarter a year ago. LDC net
charge-offs, including losses on sales and swaps, were $6 million
in the first quarter, compared with $51 million in the same
period a year ago.

The provision for losses in the first quarter of 1994 was
lower than non-LDC net charge-offs as a result of management's
evaluation of continuing improvement in the corporation's credit
environment. As a result of the ongoing decline in nonperforming
assets, reserve coverage reached 126 percent of nonperforming
loans as of March 31, 1994.

At March 31, the non-LDC allowance for losses was $2.400
billion, compared with $2.220 billion on the same date a year
ago.
<PAGE>

<PAGE> 8
The LDC allowance at March 31 was $591 million, compared
with $768 million on the same date a year ago. Total LDC medium-
and long-term outstandings at March 31 were $1.8 billion, versus
$3.2 billion on the same date a year ago.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS
At March 31, total nonperforming assets were $3.203 billion,
down $322 million, or 9 percent, from $3.525 billion at December
31 and down $2.503 billion, or 44 percent, from $5.706 billion on
March 31 a year ago. Nonperforming assets have declined by
$3.384 billion, or 51 percent, since the peak in the third
quarter of 1992. Based on the current view of the portfolio, the
corporation expects that nonperforming assets will continue to
decline in coming quarters.

Total non-LDC nonperforming assets at March 31 were $2.679
billion, down from $2.903 billion at December 31 and from $4.476
billion a year ago. Non-LDC nonperforming loans at March 31 were
$1.845 billion, down from $1.969 billion at December 31 and down
from $3.218 billion at March 31, 1993. Assets acquired as loan
satisfactions were $834 million at March 31, down from $934
million at December 31 and down $424 million from $1.258 billion
on March 31 a year ago.

LDC nonperforming loans were $524 million at March 31,
compared with $1.230 billion on the same date a year ago.

(a) On January 1, 1994, the corporation adopted FASI 39, which
increased total assets approximately $14.5 billion at March 31,
1994 and total average assets by approximately $13.1 billion for
the 1994 first quarter.

(c) Estimated

OTHER FINANCIAL DATA
The corporation's effective tax rate was 41.5 percent and
30.3 percent in the first quarter of 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Tax expense for the first quarter of 1993 included an income tax
benefit of approximately $63 million. Because the corporation
recognized its remaining available Federal tax benefits in the
third quarter of 1993, the corporation's earnings beginning in
the fourth quarter of 1993 were reported on a fully-taxed basis.

SFAS No. 115 resulted in a net unfavorable impact of
approximately $192 million after-tax on the corporation's
stockholders' equity at March 31, 1994 compared with a favorable
impact of $215 million at December 31, 1993. The net change from
the 1993 year-end was primarily the result of the higher interest
rate environment and the declining value of Brady bonds.
<PAGE>

<PAGE> 11
On January 1, 1994, the corporation adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contracts," which changes the reporting of unrealized gains and
losses on interest rate and foreign exchange contracts on the
balance sheet. The Interpretation requires that gross unrealized
gains be reported as assets and gross unrealized losses be
reported as liabilities. The Interpretation, however, permits
netting of such unrealized gains and losses with the same
counterparty when master netting agreements have been executed.
The adoption of this Interpretation has resulted in an increase
in assets and liabilities of $14.5 billion at March 31, 1994,
with unrealized gains reported as Trading Account-Risk Management
Instruments and the unrealized losses reported in Other
Liabilities.

Total assets at March 31 were $166.0 billion, versus $147.5
billion on the same date a year ago. Total loans at March 31
were $74.7 billion, compared with $81.2 billion a year ago. At
the end of the first quarter, total deposits were $95.1 billion,
compared with $93.2 billion at March 31, 1993.

The return on average total assets for the first quarter was
.79 percent, compared with 1.06 percent in the same year-ago
period. The return on average common stockholders' equity was
12.24 percent for the first quarter, compared with 16.47 percent
in the first quarter of 1993.

Book value per common share was $36.74 at March 31, versus
$33.50 per share on the same date a year ago.

TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES
Texas Commerce Bancshares (TCB) earned $51 million in the
first quarter, versus $29 million in the year-ago first quarter.
Excluding the one-time restructuring charge of $43 million ($30
million after-tax) and net benefits of $14 million resulting from
the previously-mentioned accounting changes, income for the first
quarter of 1993 would have been $45 million.

The net yield on interest-earning assets was 3.86 percent in
the first quarter, versus 4.18 percent in the 1993 first quarter.

At March 31, total assets of TCB were $21.2 billion, versus
$21.0 billion a year ago.
