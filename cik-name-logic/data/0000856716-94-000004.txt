ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On December 6, 1993, Green River Gathering Company ("Green
River") and Mountain Gas Resources, Inc. ("Mountain Gas")
filed a complaint (the "Complaint") against Washington
Energy Exploration, Inc. ("Washington") in District Court in
Arapahoe County, Colorado seeking the payment of certain
outstanding receivables from Washington and a declaratory
judgment that the gathering agreement between Washington and
Green River is in full force and effect.

On December 27, 1993, Washington filed an answer,
counterclaim, crossclaim and request for trial by jury (the
"Answer") in response to the Complaint. The Answer denies
the substance of the allegations set forth in the Complaint
and asserts certain affirmative defenses. Washington has
also made certain counterclaims seeking money damages
relating to Green River's performance under the gathering
agreement and under a processing agreement between the
parties, and seeks a declaratory judgment that both
agreements have been terminated. In addition, Washington
has made a crossclaim against two unaffiliated entities,
each of which owned part of Green River during part of the 
time period in question. 

Western Gas Resources, Inc. (the "Company") believes that
Green River is in compliance with the gathering agreement
and the processing agreement and that both are in full force
and effect. Washington is the operator of wells producing
approximately 33% of the natural gas transported through the
Green River gathering system to Mountain Gas' Granger
facility. 

The Company owns 100% of Green River, directly or
indirectly, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mountain
Gas.
