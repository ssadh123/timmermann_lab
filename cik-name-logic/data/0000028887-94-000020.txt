DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION

ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS

MAYNARD, MA -- APRIL 15, 1994

Digital Equipment Corporation (NYSE::DEC) today reported results for

its third quarter, which ended April 2, 1994.

For the quarter, the Corporation reported total operating revenues of

$3,258,789,000, down 6% from $3,453,676,000 for the comparable quarter a

year ago. This includes product revenues of $1,749,621,000, down 1% and

service and other revenues of $1,509,168,000, down 11% from the comparable

quarter a year ago.

For the quarter, the Corporation reported a net loss of $183,306,000,

or $1.34 per share, compared with a net loss of $30,121,000, or $.23 per

share for the comparable quarter a year ago. 

For the nine months ending April 2, 1994, the Corporation reported

total operating revenues of $9,527,816,000, down 9% from $10,457,418,000,

from the comparable period a year ago. This includes product revenues of

$4,966,549,000, down 10% and service and other revenues of $4,561,267,000,

down 8% from $4,954,991,000 of the comparable period a year ago.

For the nine months ended April 2, 1994, the Corporation reported a

net loss of $338,635,000, or $2.50 per share, compared with a net loss of

$364,526,000, or $2.81 per share for the comparable period a year ago. The

net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 1994 includes a one-time

benefit of $20,042,000, or $.14 per share, related to the adoption of a

change in accounting principle for income taxes. 

Robert B. Palmer, President and CEO said, "The financial results are

unacceptable to this management and obviously disappointing. This is

especially true because results of the quarter stand in contrast to the

progress Digital people have made on so many fronts and the five quarters

in a row of improved year over year results. Growth in our new products is

beginning to overtake the declines in our other products, but we have not

yet achieved a competitive cost structure. I remain absolutely committed

to restoring Digital to profitability. We need to achieve a competitive

cost structure as quickly as possible."

"As a consequence, I have instructed our senior managers to take actions

to achieve competitive lead times for high demand products, to accelerate

our on-going restructuring efforts, to further sharply reduce spending, to

conserve cash and to do all this without losing our emphasis on building

demand and supporting our customers. We will also consider further

restructuring to achieve our goals."

"The changing nature of our business continues to present both challenges

and opportunities. We are experiencing significant growth, in both

revenues and in units, at the highly-competitive low end of our product

line. In fact, one contributor to our disappointing results was our

inability to satisfy rapidly increasing customer demand for personal<PAGE>

computers, Alpha AXP workstations and some storage products," he said.

"Our total workstation business is now growing again both in units and in

revenues, driven by the success of our Alpha AXP systems. Alpha systems

now represent nearly 50 percent of total system revenues excluding PC's,

and are almost equivalent to VAX system revenues," Palmer added. "We are

providing leadership products at very competitive prices, revenues from low

end products and indirect channels are expanding, but product gross margins

continue to decline. Similar pressures on revenue mix and margins are also

having an impact on our services business. As a result, our cost structure

is not yet competitive for the level of revenues we are generating." 

William M. Steul, Vice President and CFO said, "Product revenues were

essentially flat with the third quarter of last year, much improved from

the double digit declines we experienced in the first half of the fiscal

year. In fact, while VAX revenues continued to decline, total product

revenues increased 5 percent from the December quarter led by strong growth

in personal computers, Alpha AXP workstations, storage products and

networking products. With continued mix shift to low-end products and

aggressive pricing actions taken on some products in the quarter, we

experienced a product gross margin decline of nearly 10 points year over

year." 

"Service revenues overall declined nearly 11 percent compared with last

year. While we are winning multivendor customer service business,

increasing product reliability and the erosion of our traditional systems

installed base is putting pressure on revenues and margins. We expect the

pressures on our service revenues and margins to continue," Steul added.

"On a geographic basis, we achieved slight revenue growth in the U.S., all

in the product revenue line. The Asia Pacific region continued to show

robust growth, and Europe declined compared with last year, but at a slower

rate of decline than we experienced in the first half. We did experience

some revenue declines due to the adverse effect of foreign currency

fluctuations, but less so than in the first half of the fiscal year," he

concluded.

"Earlier this week the Company announced the Digital 2100 Server, that

provides commercial users with large system features with small system

advantages and technical users with supercomputing performance at

workstation prices," Palmer added. "The new Alpha platforms and software

operating system enhancements give us an extremely competitive offering in

the fast growing commercial UNIX market and provide our VMS customers with

functional equivalence in OpenVMS on VAX and Alpha AXP systems. Along with

new software capabilities, we offer customers the most innovative and

productive technical computing environment available in the marketplace

today. We have more than 5,000 applications shipping on Alpha AXP in

OpenVMS, UNIX and Windows NT, and we believe we have reached the critical

mass of application availability for many users," he concluded.
