ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on January 17, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames" 
or the "Company") will distribute, to certain of its banks, principal 
trade vendors and factors, summaries of its unaudited financial 
results for the five and forty-eight weeks ended January 1, 1994. 
These monthly and year-to-date results (the "monthly results") are 
attached hereto as Exhibit 20 and are incorporated by reference 
herein.

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated April 
5, 1993 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the five weeks 
ended January 1, 1994 were $45.8 million below Plan and EBITDA was 
$1.3 million below Plan. EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) before 
interest, income taxes, LIFO expense or credit, restructuring 
charges, bankruptcy expenses, depreciation and amortization, and any 
non-cash extraordinary or unusual items. In December, the sales 
shortfall was divided approximately equally between softline and 
hardline categories. The unfavorable impact from the lower-than- 
planned sales on December's EBITDA was substantially offset by a 
higher-than-planned gross margin rate and lower-than-planned 
expenses. The gross margin rate was above Plan in December due 
primarily to the Company's emphasis on higher-margin products in its 
merchandise mix and in its advertising, and lower-than-planned 
clearance markdowns and inventory shrink results. In addition, in 
December, advertising and store operating expenses (other than store 
payroll) were below Plan. 

Sales for the forty-eight weeks ended January 1, 1994 were $139.5 
million below Plan; however, EBITDA was approximately equal to Plan. 
The year-to-date sales shortfall against Plan was due, in part, to 
the Company's de-emphasis of lower-margin hardline categories and to 
shortfalls in apparel and ladies accessories sales. The unfavorable 
impact from the sales shortfall on the year-to-date EBITDA was offset 
primarily by a higher-than- planned gross margin rate and 
lower-than-planned expenses.

As of January 1, 1994, inventories were $11.9 million below Plan, 
principally in apparel categories. As planned, there were no 
outstanding borrowings under the Company's revolving line of credit 
as of January 1, 1994. The Company's cash balance at January 1, 1994 
was $3.0 million above Plan.

As of December 21, 1993, Ames had repaid all borrowings required to 
be repaid under the "clean-up" provision of its credit agreement. 
The Company expects to meet its consecutive 30-day "clean-up" 
requirement. Ames is in compliance with all debt covenants through 
fiscal December. 

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks, principal 
trade vendors and factors to facilitate their credit analysis 
following the Company's emergence from bankruptcy. The summary 
results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should 
be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal 
year ended January 30, 1993, the Company's Form 10-Q for the first, 
second, and third fiscal quarters ended May 1, 1993, July 31, 1993, 

Page 2 of 7

<PAGE>
and October 30, 1993, respectively, and the Company's Form 8-K dated 
April 5, 1993. The monthly results are being reported publicly 
solely because they are being distributed to a large number of the 
Company's vendors for purposes of their credit analyses.

In accordance with the guidelines provided by the American Institute 
of Certified Public Accountants in Statement of Position 90-7 
"Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the 
Bankruptcy Code," the Company adopted fresh-start reporting at 
December 26, 1992, the effective date of the Chapter 11 plan of 
reorganization for accounting purposes. Under fresh-start reporting, 
the reorganization value of the Company upon its emergence from 
Chapter 11 was allocated to its net assets on the basis of the 
purchase method of accounting at December 26, 1992. Accordingly, 
monthly results during the fiscal year ending January 29, 1994, 
except for the December balance sheet, will not be comparable in 
material respects to such results for the eleven months ended 
December 26, 1992. The presentation of EBITDA results in a more 
meaningful comparison with last year due to the impact of fresh-start 
reporting on depreciation, amortization and LIFO inventory.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed 
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee. Although Ames expects to make monthly 
results public for a period of time following its emergence from 
bankruptcy, Ames does not believe it is obligated to provide such 
information indefinitely, other than as required by applicable 
regulations, and Ames may cease making such disclosures and updates 
at any time. The monthly results were not examined, reviewed or 
compiled by Ames' independent certified accountants. Moreover, Ames 
does not believe that it is obligated to update the monthly results 
to reflect subsequent events or developments. The reported monthly 
results are subject to future adjustments, if any, that could 
materially affect such results. However, in the opinion of the 
Company, the monthly results contain all adjustments (consisting of 
normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the 
results for the periods presented.
