[HECLA MINING COMPANY LETTERHEAD]

FOURTH QUARTER REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1993

FEBRUARY 3, 1994
HECLA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS

COEUR D'ALENE, IDAHO -- Hecla Mining Company (HL:NYSE) today reported a
net loss of $3.8 million on revenue of $19.5 million for the fourth quarter of
1993. After a $2 million dividend to preferred shareholders, the Company's
loss for the 1993 quarter amounted to $5.8 million, or 17 cents per common
share. This is in contrast to a net loss of $51.1 million, or $1.65 per common
share, for the same period of 1992.

For the year, Hecla reported a net loss of $11.7 million on revenue of
$84.8 million. After preferred dividends of $4.1 million, the Company's loss
for 1993 amounted to $15.8 million, or 48 cents per common share. This
compares with a loss of $49.3 million, or $1.60 a share, on revenue of $113.1
million for 1992. In 1992, noncash asset write-downs and reclamation accruals
of $41 million made up the bulk of the loss. In 1993, similar charges to
earnings accounted for $2.5 million of the loss. Total revenue for 1993
declined 25 percent compared with 1992 mainly as the result of curtailed metals
production at the silver operations and lower grade ore being mined at the
Republic mine. Lead and zinc, important byproducts of Hecla's silver
operations, were affected by severely depressed prices with lead at an
eight-year low. Reduced production and low lead and zinc prices offset the
fourth quarter improvement in precious metals prices. "We are encouraged by
the recent strength of the precious metals market, and that lead and zinc
prices have also begun to trend upward," said Arthur Brown, chairman, president
and chief executive officer.

On December 29, 1993, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire
Equinox Resources Ltd. (EQX:TSE) of Vancouver, British Columbia, for 0.3 of a
share of Hecla common stock for each share of Equinox's outstanding common
stock. Due diligence by both parties has been satisfactorily completed. The
agreement will be presented for approval at a meeting of Equinox shareholders
on February 25, 1994. The acquisition immediately brings Hecla 30,000 ounces
of annual gold production from the American Girl mine in southern California,
plus a suite of promising gold and silver exploration projects. Equinox's
Rosebud deposit in northern Nevada has the potential to add more than 70,000
ounces of annual gold production to Hecla's account.

Hecla's first operation outside the United States and Canada began
production early in 1994. The La Choya mine, located in Sonora, Mexico, is
expected to produce 63,000 ounces of gold in 1994. "This area of Mexico is
drawing intense interest from other gold companies, and we believe our presence
there positions Hecla well to participate in the future growth of mining in
that country," Brown said.

During the fourth quarter, Hecla exchanged 655,000 common shares for all
the outstanding common shares of Mountain West Products in Rexburg, Idaho. The
acquisition will strengthen the Company's position in the landscape products
market with volcanic scoria, pumice and soil additives.

Hecla Mining Company has its headquarters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. During
its 103-year history, Hecla has been a leading U.S. producer of silver and
lead, and more recently a significant supplier of gold and industrial minerals.
