Item 5. Other Events
------------

On March 22, 1994, the Registrant received a merger proposal from Adia S.A.
("ASA"), whereby ASA would acquire all the outstanding common shares of the 
Registrant which it does not currently own. ASA owns, through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Adia Holdings Incorporated ("AHI"), 4,632,348 shares of the 
Registrant's common stock and 5,600,000 shares (100%) of the Registrant's Class 
B common stock, which together represent 81.4% of the Registrant's outstanding 
shares. Based upon the higher voting power of the Class B common stock, ASA 
controls 96.3% of the votes.

In the proposed merger, eight shares of common stock of the Registrant 
would be exchanged for one share of ASA stock and $112.00 in cash. The 
Registrant's special committee of outside Directors is presently reviewing the 
merger proposal. ASA will submit the necessary increase in its authorized stock 
to its shareholders for approval at ASA's Annual Meeting on April 21, 1994 in 
Lausanne, Switzerland.
