Item 5. Other Events

DEFERRED ACCOUNTING APPLICATION APPROVED

On September 30, 1994, the Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC)
approved Portland General Electric's (PGE) July 1994 deferred
accounting application. This order authorizes PGE to defer 40% of
power costs incremental to those allowed in current rates incurred 
from January 1, 1995 through March 31, 1995, or until new general 
tariffs become effective, if earlier.

The amount of revenues PGE will be allowed to collect will be the
lesser of the recorded deferral, or PGE's requested increase, or the
same level of revenue as if new tariffs had become effective January 
1, 1995. Collection of any deferral amounts will be subject to a 
PUC review of PGE earnings, as adjusted, and a determination of an
appropriate rate of return on equity. PGE will file an earnings 
review by June 30, 1995.

PGE agreed to extend the suspension period of its current general 
rate proceeding to no later than March 31, 1995 contingent on the 
PUC's approval of this deferral. See Portland General's and PGE's 
reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 1994 for 
background information regarding the rate request. 

DEFERRED ACCOUNTING REQUEST FILED

On September 30, 1994 PGE filed a deferred accounting application
with the PUC. If approved, PGE would defer, for later collection, 
40% of power costs incremental to those allowed in current rates for 
the period October 1, 1994 until December 31, 1994. Collection of 
any deferral amounts would be subject to a PUC review of PGE 
earnings, as adjusted, and a determination of an appropriate rate of 
return on equity. PGE expects an order on this application by year 
end 1994.
