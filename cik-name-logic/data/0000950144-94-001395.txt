REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders of
IRT Property Company:

We have audited the accompanying combined statement of revenues and certain
continuing expenses of the two shopping centers identified in Note 1 of the
notes to the combined statement of revenues and certain continuing expenses for
the year ended December 31, 1993. This financial statement is the
responsibility of the management of the shopping centers. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statement. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

The accompanying statement of revenues and certain continuing expenses was
prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in the Form 8-K of IRT
Property Company, as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the two shopping centers' revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the combined statement of revenues and certain continuing
expenses referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the
revenues and certain continuing expenses of the two shopping centers for the
year ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND

CERTAIN CONTINUING EXPENSES

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND

THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1994 (UNAUDITED)

1. GENERAL

On May 31, 1994, IRT Property Company ("IRT" or the "Company"), a real
estate investment trust, entered into a contract to purchase two
shopping centers owned by Countryside Shops and Westgate Square,
Florida general partnerships with common partners. The two shopping
centers are managed by Southeast Shopping Center Corporation, a
related party. Therefore, the accompanying combined statements of
revenues and certain continuing expenses include the results of
operations of the following two shopping centers (the "properties"):

- Countryside Shops--Cooper City, Florida
- Westgate Square--Sunrise, Florida

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying combined financial statements are not representative
of the actual operations of the shopping centers for the periods
presented. Certain expenses may not be comparable to the expenses
expected to be incurred by the Company in the proposed future
operations of the shopping centers. The Company is not aware of any
material factors relating to the shopping centers that would cause the
reported financial information not to be indicative of future
operating results. Excluded expenses consist of interest,
depreciation and amortization, and other costs not directly related to
the future operations of the shopping centers.

Revenue Recognition

Expense recoveries are based on common area maintenance, property tax,
and insurance expenses, as defined in the leases, and are accrued on a
monthly basis. Administrative fees are assessed against applicable
tenants to offset the shopping centers' overhead costs and are
included in expense recoveries. The accrual of income is suspended
if rental payments are delinquent 60 days or more. Percentage rents,
based on tenants' sales volumes, are recognized as revenue when
earned.
<PAGE> 6
Management Fees

Management fees are included in the combined statements of revenues
and certain continuing expenses to the extent the charges conform to
IRT's current policy of charging 4% of base and percentage rents.
Similar fees, based on a different rate, were paid to a related party
in 1993.

3. TENANT LEASE TERMS

The properties were leased to various tenants under operating leases
that expire at various dates. The occupancy levels during 1993 and
other leasing information were as follows:

IRT PROPERTY COMPANY
PRO FORMA COMBINED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS
(Unaudited)

The following unaudited pro forma combined statements of earnings for
the year ended December 31, 1993 and the three-month period ended March 31,
1994 have been prepared by combining the consolidated statements of earnings of
IRT Property Company (the "Company") with the combined statements of
operations, as adjusted, of the Centers for the periods indicated.

The pro forma combined statements presented below assume that the
purchase of the Centers had been consummated as of January 1, 1993.

The pro forma combined statements of earnings do not necessarily
reflect operations as they would have been if IRT had owned the Centers during
such periods and should not be deemed to be necessarily indicative of the
future results of the Company after the purchase.

The pro forma combined statements of earnings should be read in
conjunction with their notes, together with the combined statement of revenues
and certain continuing operating expenses of the Centers for the year ended
December 31, 1993, included as an exhibit herein, and the financial statements
of the Company included in its 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders and its

IRT PROPERTY COMPANY
NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS
(Unaudited)

Adjustments assuming that the acquisition of the Centers occurred at the
beginning of the period, with the acquisition funded through borrowings under
the Company's revolving term loan and repayment of such borrowings upon
completion of the Company's 1993 stock and debenture offerings:

(a) Decrease in interest income from short-term investments due to
utilization of otherwise idle cash at interest rates of approximately
3.00% for the period of September 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993
and 3.20% for the first quarter of 1994.

(b) Increase in interest expense on bank indebtedness based on estimated
borrowings for the period January 1, 1993 through August 31, 1993 of
$25,000,000 at 4.438% partially offset by lower commitment fees.

(c) Increase in depreciation expense for two additional operating centers
in 1993 and for the three-month period ended March 31, 1994.

(d) The operating expenses of rental properties for the Centers includes
management fees of $99,511 for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
$25,148 for the three-month period ended March 31, 1994. It is
assumed that these fees would offset any increase in general and
administrative expenses required by an increase in personnel and
associated costs.

The following presents the estimated pro forma earnings from
operations and funds from operations of the Centers for the year ended December
31, 1993 based on the audited combined statement of revenues and certain

is defined as net cash flows from operating activities before changes in
accrued assets and liabilities. These estimated pro forma results do not

future and were prepared on the basis described in the notes to the pro forma
financial statements which should be read in conjunction herewith.
