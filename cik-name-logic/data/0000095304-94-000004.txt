(a) Recent Developments
-------------------

Sun Company, Inc. today announced that it has signed a letter of
intent with Chevron U.S.A. Products Co. to purchase Chevron's 177,000-
barrel-a-day Philadelphia Refinery plus Chevron's one-third interest in a
petroleum pipeline connecting the refinery to the New York Harbor, for
approximately $170 million, including inventory. Closing is expected by
the third quarter of 1994, subject to approval by various government
agencies.

Sun Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert H. Campbell said he
was pleased that Sun and Chevron had reached agreement. "The Chevron
Refinery is right next to our Philadelphia Refinery, and we are already
purchasing finished products and refinery feedstocks from them, so there
are a number of synergies that can be developed," he noted.

"We intend to run the refinery to take advantage of these synergies,
and we expect to see an immediate positive contribution to both cash and
income as a result of this purchase."

For the past several years, Chevron has operated the facility as a
"merchant" refinery, selling largely to the wholesale market, including
Sun. Campbell said it is Sun's intention to continue supplying this
market.

Commenting on why Sun would purchase a refinery at a time when there
is an oversupply of refining capacity in the United States, Campbell said,
"This acquisition is in line with our strategy of growth in our core
businesses. We will operate the refinery in an environmentally responsible
manner to supply our own needs and will continue sales to Chevron's
existing wholesale customers."

He added that the acquisition would result in improved operating
efficiencies. "By operating the refinery jointly with our Philadelphia and
Marcus Hook, Pa., refineries as part of our Delaware Valley Refining
Complex, all three refineries will be strengthened," he stated.

The refinery produces gasoline, distillate fuel, low-sulfur residual
fuel, and petrochemicals, and it employs approximately 550 people. "We
fully expect to preserve most of these jobs," Campbell said.

Refining operations first began at the site in the 1920's, and a major
expansion occurred in the 1950's. The 711-acre refinery was owned by Gulf
Corporation until 1984, when Gulf was acquired by Chevron.
