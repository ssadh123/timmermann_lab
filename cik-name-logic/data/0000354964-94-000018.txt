Item 5. Other Events

On June 28, 1994, Household Bank, f.s.b. ("Household
Bank"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Household
International, Inc. ("Household International") entered
into a Branch Purchase Agreement with First Madison
Bank, FSB ("First Madison"), whereby Household Bank
agreed to acquire from First Madison 26 branch offices
located in the metropolitan Chicago area and to assume
related deposit liabilities, which as of June 28, 1994
were in the approximate amount of $1.3 billion, and
certain loans associated with such branches. Household
Bank's acquisition is contingent upon, among other
things, First Madison's acquisition of substantially
all the assets and liabilities of First Nationwide
Bank, a Federal Savings Bank. Household Bank's
acquisition is scheduled to close in October 1994.

As a result of the acquisition, Household Bank may be
required to maintain a higher level of capital. The
additional capital, if any, may be obtained from
Household International in the form of a cash capital
contribution.
