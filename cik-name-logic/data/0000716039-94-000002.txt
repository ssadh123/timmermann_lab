MESA AND UNOCAL SETTLE LITIGATION
---------------------------------

MESA Inc. and Unocal Corporation today jointly announced that 
they have agreed to settle a lawsuit against MESA brought by 
Unocal and a Unocal stockholder. 
Both Unocal and MESA said that they believe the settlement is 
in the best interests of their respective stockholders in light of 
the uncertainties of litigation and other relevant circumstances.
Under the terms of the settlement, Unocal will receive $47.5 
million in cash from MESA and other parties named in the lawsuit. 
MESA's share of the payment will be $42.8 million. For the 
purpose of settling the claim, MESA intends to issue and sell an 
additional amount of its 12-3/4% Secured Discount Notes due in 
1998 as permitted by the indenture governing the presently 
outstanding notes.
After accounting for all fees and expenses related to the 
litigation, Unocal expects to realize approximately $33 million 
before tax from the settlement. MESA will reflect the loss from 
the settlement in the fourth quarter of 1993.
The lawsuit alleged that the defendants had purchased and sold 
Unocal common shares within a six-month period in 1985 in 
transactions subject to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, resulting in alleged short-swing profits of 
approximately $99 million that were recoverable by Unocal under 
Section 16(b). The plaintiffs also asked the court, in its 
discretion, to grant pre-judgment interest, which amount could 
currently exceed $50 million. MESA contended that none of the 
share transactions were subject to Section 16(b) and, further, 
that no profit was realized. The lawsuit was filed in 1986.
The settlement must be approved by the United States District 
Court for the Central District of California following notification
by Unocal to its security holders. It is expected that the 
settlement will be effective in the first quarter of 1994.
