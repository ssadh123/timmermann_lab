ARVIN INDUSTRIES, INC.

(an Indiana corporation)

Debt Securities

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT - BASIC PROVISIONS
-----------------------------------------

February __, 1994

To: The Underwriters named in
the within-mentioned Terms
Agreement

Dear Sirs:

Arvin Industries, Inc., an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), proposes to
issue and sell up to $75,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Debt
Securities (the "Securities") in one or more offerings on terms determined at
the time of sale. The Securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of
July 3, 1990 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Harris Trust and Savings
Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"). Each issue of Securities may vary as to
aggregate principal amount, maturity date or dates, interest rate or rates and
timing of payments thereof, redemption provisions and sinking fund requirements,
if any, and any other variable terms which the Indenture contemplates may be set
forth in the Securities as issued from time to time.

Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Securities, it will
enter into an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
"Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Securities to, and the
purchase and offering thereof by, Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, and Lehman Brothers Inc. (together, the
"Representatives"), and each of the other underwriters named therein (the
"Underwriters" or "you", which terms shall include the Representatives whether
acting alone in the sale of Securities or as members of an underwriting
syndicate). The Terms Agreement relating to each offering of Securities shall
specify the principal amount of Securities to be issued and their terms not
otherwise specified in the Indenture, the name or names of the Underwriters
participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section
10 hereof) and the principal amount of Securities which each severally agrees to
purchase, the price at which the Securities are to be purchased by the
Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price and the time
and place of delivery and payment. Each offering of Securities will be governed
by this Agreement, as supplemented by
<PAGE>

the applicable Terms Agreement, and this Agreement and such Terms Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each Underwriter participating
in the offering of such Securities.

The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 33-41242) relating to
the Securities and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with
Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and has filed such
amendments thereto as may have been required to the date hereof. Such
registration statement, as amended, has been declared effective by the
Commission, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939 (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement, as amended, and the
prospectus relating to the sale of Securities by the Company constituting a part
thereof, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time
to time amended, updated or supplemented pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as
the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively; provided,
however, that a supplement of the Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a) hereof
(a "Prospectus Supplement", which term shall include any preliminary Prospectus
Supplement) shall be deemed to have supplemented the Prospectus only with
respect to the offering of Securities to which it relates.

All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and
other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus (and all other references of like
import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and
schedules and other information which is or is deemed to be incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be;
and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the
filing of any document under the 1934 Act which is or is deemed to be
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as
the case may be.

SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and
warrants to you as of the date hereof, as of the date of the applicable Terms
Agreement and as of the Closing Time, as hereinafter defined, under such Terms
Agreement (in each case, the "Representation Date") as follows:

(a) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, at the time the
Registration Statement became effective and as of the applicable
Representation Date, complied and will comply in all material respects with
the 1933 Act, the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act
(the

-2-
<PAGE>

"1933 Act Regulations") and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
"1939 Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1939
Act (the "1939 Act Regulations"). The Registration Statement, at the time
the Registration Statement became effective (or, if an amendment to the
Registration Statement or an annual report on Form 10-K has been filed by the
Company with the Commission subsequent to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, then at the time of the most recent such filing) did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, at the time the
Registration Statement became effective (unless the term "Prospectus" refers
to a prospectus which has been or will be provided to the Underwriters by the
Company for us in connection with the offering of Securities which differs
from the Prospectus on file with the Commission at the time the Registration
Statement became effective, in which case, at the time it is provided to the
Underwriters for such use), and as of the applicable Representation Date, did
not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided, however, that the representations and warranties in this subsection
shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement
or Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter, or on behalf of any
Underwriter by the Representatives, expressly for use in the Registration
Statement or Prospectus.

(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus pursuant to
Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act, at the time they were or hereafter
are filed or last amended, as the case may be, with the Commission, complied
and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934
Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "1934 Act
Regulations") and, when read together and with the other information in the
Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto
became or become effective and at each Representation Date, did not and will
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
or are made, not misleading.

schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus are independent public accountants as required by the 1933
Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.

(d) The financial statements (other than quarterly or other unaudited
interim financial statements) included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly the financial
position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the dates
indicated and the results of their operations for the periods specified; said
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent (except as otherwise stated
therein) basis; the supporting schedules included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement present fairly the information
required to be stated therein; and the Company's ratios of earnings to fixed
charges (actual and, if any, pro forma) included in the Prospectus and in
Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement have been calculated in compliance
with Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K of the Commission. Any quarterly or other
unaudited interim financial statements, and the related notes thereto,
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, have been prepared in compliance with the applicable requirements
of the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act
Regulations and have been prepared on a basis substantially consistent
(except as otherwise stated therein) with that of the applicable audited
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and such unaudited interim
financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present a fair
statement of the results of operations for the periods reported. The
financial information and statistical data set forth in the Prospectus under
the captions "Selected Financial Data" and "Capitalization" are fairly stated
in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements
of the Company from which they have been derived.

(e) Since the respective dates as to which information is given in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except as otherwise stated therein
(including information contained in documents subsequently incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus), (1) there has
been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or
in the earnings, affairs or business prospects of the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not

-4-
<PAGE>

arising in the ordinary course of business; (2) there have been no
transactions entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other
than those in the ordinary course of business, which are material with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; and

of any kind declared, paid or made by the Company on any class of its capital
stock.

(f) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a
corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Indiana with
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus; and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to
transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify
would not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business or
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

(g) Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company (as that term is used in
Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations) has been duly incorporated and is
validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and is duly qualified as a
foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of
the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where
the failure to so qualify would not in the aggregate have a material adverse
effect on the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as one enterprise; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of each Significant Subsidiary shown as owned by the Company on Schedule A to
this Agreement has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid
and nonassessable and is owned by the Company, free and clear of any security
interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim.

(h) The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company
is as set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Capitalization" (except

thereto contained in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of its
charter or in default in the performance or observance of any material
obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any material
contract, indenture, joint venture agreement, mortgage, loan agreement, note,
lease or other instrument to which it or its property may be bound; and the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement, the
Indenture and the Securities and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein and therein have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action and will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or a
default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to, any contract, indenture, joint venture agreement,
mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them may be
bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the
provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any applicable law, administrative regulation or
administrative or court decree.

(j) No labor dispute with the employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent; and the
Company is not aware of any existing or imminent labor disturbance by the
employees of any of its or its subsidiaries' principal suppliers,
manufacturers or contractors which might be expected to result in any

earnings, affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as one enterprise.

(k) There is no action, suit or proceeding before or by any court or
governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, which is required to be disclosed in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus (other than as disclosed therein), or which might
materially and adversely affect the consummation of this Agreement or the
applicable Terms Agreement or, except in cases in which such

-6-
<PAGE>

consequences are remote, which might result in any material adverse change in
the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, affairs or
business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one
enterprise, or, except in cases in which such consequences are remote, which
might materially and adversely affect the properties or assets thereof; all
pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any
subsidiary is a party or of which any of their property is the subject which
are not described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, including
ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company's business, are,
considered in the aggregate, not material to the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as one enterprise; and there are no contracts or documents of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries which are required to be filed as exhibits
to the Registration Statement by the 1933 Act or by the 1933 Act Regulations
which have not been so filed.

(l) The Company and its subsidiaries own or possess, or can acquire on
reasonable terms, the patents, patent rights, licenses, inventions,
copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or
unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures),
trademarks, service marks and trade names (collectively, the "Intellectual
Property") presently employed by them in connection with the business now
operated by them, except where the failure to own or possess, or inability to
so acquire, such Intellectual Property would not result in any material
adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the assets,
earnings, affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as one enterprise; and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has received any notice or is otherwise aware of any
infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to

change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the assets, earnings,
affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered
as one enterprise.

(m) No authorization, approval or consent of any court or governmental
authority or agency is required for the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such as may be required
under the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations or state securities laws for
the Securities and the qualification of the Indenture under the 1939 Act.

-7-
<PAGE>

(n) The Company and its subsidiaries possess such certificates, authorities
or permits issued by the appropriate state, federal or foreign governmental
or regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business now
operated by them, except where the failure to possess such certificates,
authorities or permits would not materially and adversely affect the conduct
of the business, operations, financial condition or income of the Company and
its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; and neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to
the revocation or modification of any such certificate, authority or permit
which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of any unfavorable
decision, ruling or finding, would materially and adversely affect the
conduct of the business, operations, financial condition or income of the
Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

(o) This Agreement has been, and after its execution and delivery, the
applicable Terms Agreement will be, duly authorized, executed and delivered

(p) The Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company and has been
duly qualified under the 1939 Act and duly executed and delivered by the
Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the
enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally or by general equitable principles.

(q) The Securities have been duly authorized for issuance and sale
pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement (or will have
been so authorized prior to each issuance of Securities) and, at the
applicable Closing Time, will have been duly executed by the Company and,
when authenticated in the manner provided for in the Indenture and delivered
against payment of the purchase price therefor specified in the applicable
Terms Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms,
except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles, and will be
in the form contemplated by, and entitled to the benefits of, the Indenture.

(r) The Securities and the Indenture will conform in all material respects
to the respective statements relating

-8-
<PAGE>

respective forms filed or incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as

(s) The Securities rank and will rank on a parity with all unsecured
indebtedness (other than subordinated indebtedness) of the Company that is
outstanding on the date hereof or that may be incurred hereafter, and senior

date hereof or that may be incurred hereafter.

(t) The Company meets, and on the effective date of the Registration
Statement met and on each Representation Date will meet, the requirements for
use of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.

Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the

in accordance with the provisions of Section 10) following the date of the
applicable Terms Agreement or such other time not later than ten business days
following the date of the applicable Terms Agreement as shall be agreed upon in
writing by the Representatives and the Company (each such time and date being
referred to as a "Closing Time"). Payment shall be made to the Company by

<PAGE>

SECTION 3. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants with each
Underwriter as follows:

(a) Immediately following the execution of each Terms Agreement, the
Company will prepare a Prospectus Supplement setting forth the principal
amount of Securities covered thereby and their terms not otherwise specified
in the Indenture, the names of the Underwriters and the principal amount of
Securities which each severally has agreed to purchase, the names of the
Representatives, the price at which the Securities are to be purchased by the
Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, the selling
concession and reallowance, if any, and such other information as the
Representatives and the Company deem appropriate in connection with the
offering of the Securities. The Company will promptly transmit copies of the
Prospectus Supplement to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424 of
the 1933 Act Regulations and will furnish to the Underwriters named therein
as many copies of the Prospectus, such Prospectus Supplement and any
preliminary Prospectus Supplement as such Underwriters shall reasonably
request.

(b) From the date of a Terms Agreement, and for so long as a Prospectus is
required to be delivered in connection with the sale of Securities covered by
such Terms Agreement, the Company will notify the Representatives
immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, (i) of the effectiveness of
any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) of the mailing or the
delivery to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or
any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated
by reference into the Registration Statement or Prospectus, (iii) of the
receipt of any comments or other communications from the Commission with
respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Prospectus
Supplement, (iv) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the
Registration Statement of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or
for additional information, and (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. The Company will make every
reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop
order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible
moment.

(c) From the date of a Terms Agreement, and for so long as a Prospectus is
required to be delivered in connection with the sale of Securities covered by
such Terms Agreement, the Company will give the Representatives notice

-10-
<PAGE>

of its intention to file any amendment to the Registration Statement or any
amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (including through the filing of
documents under the 1934 Act or a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)
which differs from the prospectus on file at the Commission), whether
pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, will furnish the
Representatives with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other
documents proposed to be filed a reasonable time in advance of filing, and
will not file any such amendment or supplement to which the Representatives
or counsel for the Underwriters shall reasonably object.

(d) The Company will deliver to the Representatives as many signed and
conformed copies of the registration statement (as originally filed) and of
each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by
reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act) as the Representatives
may reasonably request, and will also deliver to the Representatives a
conformed copy of the Registration Statement and each amendment thereto for
each of the Underwriters.

(e) If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be
delivered in connection with sales of the Securities any event shall occur or
condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of
counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, to further amend or
supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of
circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser or
prospective purchaser or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either
such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the
1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and
file with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing
documents pursuant to the 1934 Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to
correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration
Statement comply with such requirements.

Prospectus, together with the applicable Prospectus Supplement, at the time
it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Securities, contained
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances existing at such time, not misleading.

(b) At the applicable Closing Time, the Representatives shall have
received:

(1) The favorable opinion, dated as of the applicable Closing Time, of
Schiff Hardin & Waite, counsel for the Company, in form and substance
satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect that:

(vii) At the time the Registration Statement became effective and
at the Representation Date, the Registration Statement (other than the

therein, as to which no opinion need be rendered) complied as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the
1933 Act Regulations, the 1939 Act and the 1939 Act Regulations, and
nothing has come to their attention that leads them to believe that
the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements,
supporting schedules and other financial or statistical information or
data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no
opinion need be rendered), at the time it became effective or at the
applicable Representation Date, contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to

-15-

make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as
amended or supplemented at the date of the applicable Terms Agreement
or at the applicable Closing Time, including the documents
incorporated by reference therein (other than the financial

those disclosed in the Prospectus or in any document incorporated by

filed as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references
thereto in the Registration Statement at the Representation Date are
correct.

(xi) No authorization, approval, consent or order of any court or
governmental authority or agency is required in connection with the

-16-

consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this

Act Regulations, the 1934 Act, the 1934 Act Regulations or state
securities laws and the qualification of the Indenture under the 1939
Act; the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
applicable Terms Agreement (including this Agreement as incorporated
by reference therein), the Indenture and the Securities and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will
not result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-

information, the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement (including this Agreement as
incorporated by reference therein), the Indenture and the Securities
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and

under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to, any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan
agreement, note, lease or other instrument identified to such counsel
by the Company as being material and to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them may be
bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in any
violation of any applicable law, administrative regulation or any
administrative or court order or decree known to them.

(xii) The Indenture has been duly and validly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Company, is substantially in the form
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement
at the time the Registration Statement became effective, and (assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee)
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as

authorized by the Company and, when executed and authenticated by the
Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Trustee)
and delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor specified
in the applicable Terms Agreement, will constitute valid and binding
obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except
as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally or by general equitable

Securities" and in the applicable Prospectus Supplement under
"Description of Notes" (or any similar heading for the section of the
applicable Prospectus Supplement describing the Securities), to the
extent that it constitutes descriptions of the Indenture and
Securities, has been reviewed by them and is correct, subject to the
limitations stated therein, in all material respects.

(2) The favorable opinion, dated as of the applicable Closing Time, of
Ronald R. Snyder, Esq., Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of
the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the

-18-
<PAGE>

(i) To the best of his knowledge and information, the Company is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is
required, except where the failure to so qualify would not in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business or assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

(ii) To the best of his knowledge and information, each Significant
Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority
to own, lease or operate its properties and to conduct its business as
described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in

required, except where the failure to so qualify would not in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business or assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of each such Significant
Subsidiary shown as owned by the Company on Schedule A to this
Agreement has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid
and nonassessable, and such interest is owned by the Company, directly
or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest,
mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance or claim.

(iii) Nothing has come to such counsel's attention that leads him
to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became
effective or at the applicable Representation Date, contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented at the date of the applicable Terms Agreement or at the
applicable Closing Time, included an untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

-19-

(iv) To the best of his knowledge and information, no authorization,

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such as may
be required under the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act
and the 1934 Act Regulations or state securities laws and the
qualification of the Indenture under the 1939 Act.

(v) To the best of his knowledge and information, except as
described in the Registration Statement, at the time it became
effective or at the applicable Representation Date, there is no
action, suit or proceeding before or by any court or governmental
agency or body now pending or threatened against or affecting the
Company or any of its subsidiaries in which it is probable that such
action, suit or proceeding, except in cases in which such consequences
are considered remote, will have any material adverse effect on the
condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, affairs,
assets, properties or business prospects of the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

(vi) To the best of his knowledge and information, no default
exists in the due performance or observance of any material

reference in the Registration Statement, at the time it became
effective or at the applicable Representation Date, or the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 1993, which
defaults in the aggregate are material to the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

-20-
<PAGE>

Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the
Underwriters may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received
such papers and information as they reasonably request to enable them to
pass upon such matters. In giving their opinion, Mayer, Brown & Platt
may rely as to matters of Indiana corporate law upon the opinion of
Schiff Hardin & Waite.

(c) At the applicable Closing Time there shall not have been, since the
date of the applicable Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus,
any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in
the earnings, affairs or business prospects of the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the
ordinary course of business, and the Representatives shall have received a
certificate of the President or a Vice President of the Company and of the
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer or Treasurer of the
Company, dated as of such Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has been
no such material adverse change; (ii) the representations and warranties in
Section 1 are true and correct with the same force and effect as though

issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened
by the Commission.

(d) The Representatives shall have received from Price Waterhouse and any
other independent certified public accountants who have reviewed financial
statements included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the
applicable Prospectus Supplement letters, dated as of the applicable Terms
Agreement and as of the applicable Closing Time, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Representatives to the effect that:

(i) They are independent public accountants with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the 1933 Act and
the 1933 Act Regulations.

(ii) It is their opinion that the financial statements and
supporting schedules included or incorporated by reference in the

accounting requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the
1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.

(iii) Based upon limited procedures set forth in detail in such
letter, nothing has come to their attention which causes them to
believe that:

(A) The unaudited financial statements and supporting schedules
of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations,
the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations or are not presented in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus;

(B) The amounts set forth under the caption "Selected Financial
Data" (or other similar caption) in the Prospectus were not
determined on a basis substantially consistent with that used in
determining the corresponding amounts in the Company's audited
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus; or

(C) At a specified date not more than five days prior to the
date of the letters, there has been any change in the capital
stock of the Company or any increase in the consolidated long-term
debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any decrease in
consolidated net current assets or net assets as compared with the
amounts shown in the Company's most recent consolidated balance
sheet

-22-
<PAGE>

included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus or, during the period from the date
of such balance sheet to a specified date not more than five days
prior to the date of the letters, there were any decreases, as
compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in
consolidated net sales, net earnings or primary net earnings per
share of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances
for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur.

(iv) In addition to the examination referred to in their opinions
and the limited procedures referred to in clause (iii) above, they
have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an
audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial
information which are included in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus and which have been specified by the Representatives, and
have found such amounts, percentages and financial information to be
in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records
of the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.

(e) At the applicable Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriters shall
have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may require for
the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the
Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to
evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the
fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings
taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the
Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance
to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters.

(f) At the applicable Closing Time, the Securities shall have been duly
approved for listing and trading on the exchange specified in the related
Terms Agreement, subject only to notice of issuance.

If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when
and as required to be fulfilled, the

-23-

applicable Terms Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to
the Company at any time at or prior to the applicable Closing Time, and such
termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as
provided in Section 4.

SECTION 6. Indemnification.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and
each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
Section 15 of the 1933 Act as follows:

(1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto), including all documents
incorporated by reference therein, or the omission or alleged omission
therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
in any preliminary prospectus, Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading;

(2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in
settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with
the written consent of the Company; and

(3) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including,
subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel
chosen by you) reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by
any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent

-24-
<PAGE>

that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above;

provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any loss, claim,
damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission
or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through you
expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or
any preliminary prospectus, Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto).

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration
Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any and all loss, liability,
claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection
(a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements
or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary
prospectus, Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the
Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus, Prospectus Supplement or
the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably
practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in
respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify
an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any
liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity
agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the
defense of such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable
for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local
counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in
connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in
the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances.

SECTION 7. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in
Section 6 is for any reason held to be

-25-
<PAGE>

unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with
its terms, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate
losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by
said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and one or more of the
Underwriters, as incurred, in such proportions that the Underwriters are
responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting
discount appearing on the cover page of the relevant Prospectus Supplement bears
to the initial public offering price of the Securities appearing thereon and the
Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person,
if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933
Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each
director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration
Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning
of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Company.

SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement and
the applicable Terms Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the
Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and
effect, regardless of any termination of the applicable Terms Agreement
(including this Agreement as incorporated by reference therein), or any
investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person,
or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of any Securities
to the Underwriters.

SECTION 9. Termination. The Representative may terminate the applicable
Terms Agreement (including this Agreement, as incorporated by reference
therein), by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the applicable
Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the date of such Terms Agreement or
since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration
Statement, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise,
or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and
its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the
ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse
change in the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak or
escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis, the effect of which is
such as to make it, in the Representatives' sole judgment, impracticable to
market the Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities,

-26-
<PAGE>

or (iii) if trading in the Common Shares has been suspended by the Commission,
or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York
Stock Exchange has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have
been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by
either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental
authority, or if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal, New
York, Indiana or Illinois authorities. In the event of any such termination,
such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party
except as provided in Section 4. Notwithstanding any such termination, the
provisions of Sections 6 and 7 shall remain in effect.

SECTION 10. Default. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the
applicable Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are
obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted
Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours
thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting
Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all,
of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the
terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have
completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:

(a) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not
exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be
purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters
shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions
that their respective underwriting obligations under the applicable Terms

<PAGE>

Arvin Industries, Inc., an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to

, or registered assigns, the principal sum of ____________________ on the
Maturity Date specified above and to pay interest thereon at the Interest Rate
per annum specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made
available for payment, semiannually on February 15 and August 15 (each an
"Interest Payment Date") in each year commencing on the first Interest Payment
Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, to the registered
holder of such Note on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest
Payment Date, and on the Maturity Date shown above. Interest on this Note will
accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been
paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from the Original
Issue Date specified above, until the principal hereof has been paid or duly
made available for payment. If the Maturity Date or an Interest Payment Date
falls on a day which is not a Business Day as defined below, principal or
interest payable with respect to such Maturity Date or Interest Payment Date
will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect
as if made on such Maturity Date or Interest Payment Date, as the case may be,
and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such
Maturity Date or Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain
exceptions, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more
predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record
Date for such interest, which shall be the February 1 or August 1 (whether or
not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment
Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will
forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may
either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor
Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof
shall be given to the Holder of this Note not less than ten days prior to such
Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as
more fully provided in the Indenture. As used herein, "Business Day" means any
day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks in The City of New York are
not required or authorized by law to close.

Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the
office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States
of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the
option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled
thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register; subject in each
case to the terms of any agreement with a Person designated as a Depositary of
this Note pursuant to the Indenture.

This __% Note due February 15, 2001, is one of a duly authorized series of
Securities (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company issued and to be
issued under an Indenture dated as of July 3, 1990 (herein called the
"Indenture") between the Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee
(herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under
the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto
reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of
the Company and the Trustee

-2-
<PAGE>

and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to
be, authenticated and delivered.

This Note is not redeemable at the option of the Company and is not repayable
at the option of the Holder prior to maturity.

Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding
the Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Interest
payments for this Note will be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year
of twelve 30-day months.

The Indenture provides that so long as the Notes are outstanding, the Company
will not, and will not cause or permit a Restricted Subsidiary to, create,
incur, assume or guarantee any indebtedness existing on the date of the
Indenture which would constitute Secured Debt if it were secured by a Security
Interest in a Principal Facility unless the Debt Securities will be secured
equally and ratably (subject to applicable priorities of payment) by the
Security Interest securing such Secured Debt or indebtedness, except that the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur certain Secured Debt without
so securing the Notes. Among such permitted Secured Debt is indebtedness
secured by (i) certain Security Interests to secure payment of the cost of
acquisition, construction, development or improvement of property; (ii) Security
Interests on property at the time of acquisition assumed by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary, or on the property or on the outstanding shares or
indebtedness of a corporation or firm at the time it becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or is merged into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary acquires the properties of
such corporation or firm as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; (iii)
Security Interests arising from conditional sales agreements or title retention
agreements with respect to property acquired by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; (iv) Security Interests securing indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to the Company or to another Restricted Subsidiary; (v)
mechanics' and other statutory liens arising in the ordinary course of business
(including construction of facilities) in respect of obligations which are not
due or which are being contested in good faith; (vi) liens for taxes,
assessments or governmental charges not yet due or for taxes, assessments or
governmental charges which are being contested in good faith; (vii) Security
Interests (including judgment liens) arising in connection with legal
proceedings so long as such proceedings are being contested in good faith and,
in case of judgment liens, execution thereon is stayed; (viii) certain
landlords' liens on fixtures; (ix) Security Interests to secure partial,
progress, advance or other payments or indebtedness incurred for the purpose of
financing construction on or improvement of property subject to such Security
Interests; and (x) certain Security Interests in favor, or made at the request,
of governmental bodies. Additionally, such permitted Secured Debt includes
(with certain limitations) any extension, renewal or refunding, in whole or in
part, of any Secured Debt permitted at the time of the original incurrence
thereof. In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may incur Secured Debt, without equally and ratably securing the
Debt Securities, if the sum of (a) the amount of Secured Debt entered into after
the date of the Indenture and otherwise prohibited by the Indenture plus (b) the
aggregate value of Sale and Leaseback Transactions entered into after the date
of the Indenture and otherwise prohibited by the Indenture does not exceed ten
percent of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

The Indenture provides that so long as the Notes are outstanding the Company
will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale
and Leaseback Transaction unless (a) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
would be entitled to incur Secured Debt

-3-
<PAGE>

permitted by the Indenture only by reason of the provision described in the last
sentence of the preceding paragraph equal in amount to the net proceeds of the
property sold or transferred or to be sold or transferred pursuant to such Sale
and Leaseback Transaction and secured by a Security Interest on the property to
be leased without equally and ratably securing the Notes, or (b) the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary shall apply within 180 days after the effective date of
such Sale and Leaseback Transaction, an amount equal to such net proceeds (x) to
the acquisition, construction, development or improvement of properties,
facilities, or equipment which are, or upon such acquisition, construction,
development or improvement will be, a Principal Facility or Facilities or a part
thereof or (y) to the redemption of Debt Securities or (z) to the repayment of
Senior Funded Debt of the Company or of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
the Senior Funded Debt owed to any Restricted Subsidiary), or in part to such
acquisition, construction, development or improvement and in part to such
redemption and/or repayment. In lieu of applying an amount equal to such net
proceeds to such redemption the Company may within 180 days after such sale or
transfer, deliver to the Trustee Debt Securities (other than Debt Securities
made on the basis of a reduction in a mandatory sinking fund payment) for
cancellation and thereby reduce the amount to be applied to the redemption of
the Notes by an amount equivalent to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
delivered.

The Indenture provides that so long as the Notes are outstanding, the Company
will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, transfer
any Principal Facility to any Subsidiary which was not a Restricted Subsidiary
at the time of such transfer unless it shall apply within 180 days of the
effective date of such transaction an amount equal to the fair value of such
Principal Facility at the time of such transfer (i) to the acquisition,
construction, development or improvement of properties, facilities or equipment
which are, or upon such acquisition, construction, development or improvement
will be, a Principal Facility or Facilities or a part thereof or (ii) to the
redemption of the Notes or (iii) to the repayment of Senior Funded Debt of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Senior Funded Debt owed to any
Restricted Subsidiary), or in part to such acquisition, construction,
development or improvement and in part to such redemption and/or repayment. In
lieu of applying all or any part of such amount to such redemption the Company
may, within 180 days of such transfer, deliver to the Trustee Debt Securities
(other than the Notes made the basis of a reduction in a mandatory sinking fund
payment) for cancellation and thereby reduce the amount to be applied to the
redemption of the Notes by an amount equivalent to the aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Securities so delivered.

Except as may be provided in the Indenture, if an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders
of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare
the principal of all the Notes due and payable in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities at the time Outstanding of each series affected thereby. The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at
the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of each series,
to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the

-4-
<PAGE>

Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.
Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any
Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or
in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon
this Note.

The Indenture provides that the Company, at the Company's option, (a) will be
discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes (except for
certain obligations to register the transfer of or exchange Notes, replace
stolen, lost or mutilated Notes and maintain paying agencies) or (b) need not
comply with certain provisions of the Indenture, in each case if the Company
deposits, in trust, with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations which,
with respect to U.S. Government Obligations, through the payment of interest
thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money,
in an amount in cash sufficient to pay all of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Securities on the dates such payments are due in accordance
with the terms of such Notes and certain other conditions are satisfied.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the
Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute
and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the
time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register of
the Company upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
form satisfactory to the Company, and this Note duly executed by, the Holder
hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing and thereupon one or more
new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum
denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral
multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate
principal amount of Notes in authorized denominations, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
