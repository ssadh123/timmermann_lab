ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

Effective September 30, 1994, St. Jude Medical, Inc. acquired substantially
all of the assets (the "Acquisition") of the worldwide cardiac rhythm management
business of Siemens AG, pursuant to two asset purchase agreements: (i) the Asset
Purchase Agreement dated as of June 26, 1994 among St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the
"Company"), SJM Acquisition Corp., Siemens-Pacesetter, Inc. and Siemens Medical
Systems, Inc. ("SMS") and (ii) the [Non-U.S.] Asset Purchase Agreement dated as
of June 26, 1994 among the Company, St. Jude Medical International, Inc. and
Siemens-Elema AB (collectively, the "Purchase Agreements").

The Acquisition consisted of the tangible and intangible assets,
properties, rights and goodwill of Siemens-Pacesetter, Inc. and the Cardiac
Systems Division of Siemens-Elema AB used in their Cardiac Stimulation Device
business, excluding cash and certain other assets. The principal production
facilities acquired are located in Sylmar, California and Solna, Sweden, with
sales and support resources in over 70 countries. The Company presently intends
to continue to utilize the assets acquired for the research, development,
manufacturing, marketing and sale of cardiac rhythm management products
(including technology related to bradycardia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation
and electrophysiology) in a manner similar to that used by the sellers prior to
the Acquisition.

In consideration for the Acquisition, the Company paid $524.3 million, of
which $13 million was placed into an escrow account pending final adjustments
based on the net book value of the net assets transferred to the Company. The
Company funded the Acquisition through a combination of $274.3 million of its
general funds and $250 million bank debt provided by an eleven-member bank group
lead by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association. The terms of the
Acquisition were the result of arms-length negotiation between the parties, and
the Acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase.

Except for certain matters provided for in the Purchase Agreements and
other agreements designed to provide an orderly transition, it is expected that
the Company and Siemens will cease to have any material contractual or other
material relationship with each other following the final purchase price
adjustment. The Purchase Agreements provide that, subject to limitations, SMS
and Siemens-Elema AB will indemnify the Company for certain losses resulting
from the breach of any of their representations and warranties and losses
resulting from excluded liabilities, and the Company will indemnify SMS and
Siemens-Elema AB for certain losses resulting from assumed liabilities. The
Purchase agreements also provide for the cooperation and access to facilities
and personnel of the parties to assist in matters continuing past closing, such
as the payment of taxes and resolution of outstanding claims and litigation.
Other agreements provide for the use of the Siemens name on products, literature
and tooling for a transitional period, as well as for the provision of
transitional services by Siemens in several foreign countries for a limited
period of time.

ARTICLE 2

CONSIDERATION

2.1 Consideration. Subject to Section 2.2, the consideration
paid for the Assets shall be $414,300,000 (the "Cash Consideration").

2.2 Cash Consideration Adjustment.

2.2.1 The Cash Consideration shall be subject to adjustment,
if any, after the Closing Date (as defined in Article 3) as specified in this
Section 2.2.

2.2.2 As soon as practicable (but in no event later than 90
calendar days following the Closing Date), Shareholder shall prepare and deliver
to SJM an audited balance sheet for the Business (the "Closing Balance Sheet"),
including the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Shareholder Affiliate, as of the
Closing Date, together with a supplementary statement adjusting the balance
sheet to exclude certain assets and liabilities which are not to be sold and to
include certain other assets and liabilities which are to be sold, all as set
forth on Schedule 2.2.2. In the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet,
Shareholder shall in good faith consider all reasonable audit procedures
suggested by SJM, and to the extent such suggested procedures are acceptable to
Shareholder prepare the Closing Balance Sheet, in a manner consistent therewith.
The Deal Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet shall not include any
liability or reserve with respect to any future liabilities relating to or
arising out of the Settlement Agreement. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
accompanied by the report thereon of Price Waterhouse, independent accountants
of Shareholder ("Shareholder's Accountants"), stating that the Closing Balance
Sheet fairly presents the financial position of the Business at the Closing Date
in conformity with Schedule 2.2.2 and otherwise in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (hereinafter referred to as "U.S.
GAAP"), which Schedule 2.2.2 and U.S. GAAP shall be applied on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Deal Balance Sheet (as defined in Section
4.2). During the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet by Shareholder and the
period of any dispute provided for in Section 2.2.4, SJM shall provide
Shareholder and Shareholder's Accountants reasonable access to the books,
records, facilities and employees of the Business, and SJM, the SJM Affiliates
and their respective successors, if any, shall cooperate fully with
Shareholder's Accountants, in each case to the extent required by Shareholder
and Shareholder's Accountants in order to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and
to investigate the basis for any such dispute. SJM and its representatives shall
be given reasonable access to the books, records, facilities and employees of
Shareholder and the Shareholder Affiliate, including all supporting documents
and auditor's work papers used in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet,
as necessary for it to review the Closing Balance Sheet. SJM shall be permitted
to observe the physical count of inventory to be undertaken in preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet.

2.2.3 Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.2.4,
within 30 Business Days after the date of receipt by SJM of the Closing Balance
Sheet:

(i) If the amount of Net Book Value shown on the
Closing Balance Sheet is less than $117,453,000 by at least $800,000
(the "Designated Amount"), Shareholder shall immediately pay to SJM, as
an adjustment to the Cash Consideration, in immediately available
funds, an amount equal to such excess over the Designated Amount; and

(ii) If the amount of Net Book Value shown on the
Closing Balance Sheet is greater than $117,453,000 by at least the
Designated Amount, SJM shall immediately pay, as an adjustment to the
Cash Consideration, in immediately available funds, to Shareholder an
amount equal to such excess over the Designated Amount.

2.2.4 If not disputed by SJM in accordance with this Section
2.2.4, the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Shareholder to SJM shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. SJM may dispute any amounts
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet to the extent that the net effect of such
disputed amounts in the aggregate would be to change the Net Book Value
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet by more than the Designated Amount, but
only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet were
not arrived at in accordance with Schedule 2.2.2 and otherwise in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, or that the adjustments set forth in Schedule 2.2.2 or U.S. GAAP
were not applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Deal Balance
Sheet; provided, however, that SJM shall notify Shareholder and Shareholder's
Accountants in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in
dispute and setting forth, in detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30
Business Days of SJM's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event of
such a dispute, each of Shareholder and SJM shall negotiate in good faith to
reconcile their differences. If such dispute has not been resolved within 10
Business Days after the notice referred to in the preceding sentence has been
given, Ernst & Young ("SJM's Accountants") and Shareholder's Accountants shall
attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
If any such resolution by SJM's Accountants and Shareholder's Accountants leaves
in dispute amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate (together with any
amounts originally disputed by SJM but no longer in dispute ("Non-Disputed
Amounts")) would not be to change the Net Book Value reflected on the Closing
Balance Sheet by at least the Designated Amount, all the amounts remaining in
dispute shall then be deemed to have been resolved in favor of the Closing
Balance Sheet, and such resolution shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties hereto. If SJM's Accountants and Shareholder's Accountants are unable to
reach a resolution, leaving in dispute amounts the net effect of which in the
aggregate (together with Non-Disputed Amounts) would change the Net Book Value
reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet by at least the Designated Amount, SJM's
Accountants and Shareholder's Accountants shall submit the items remaining in
dispute that SJM shall be entitled to dispute by the terms of this Section 2.2.4
for resolution to Deloitte & Touche or such other independent accounting firm of
international reputation as may be mutually acceptable to Shareholder and SJM
(the "Independent Accounting Firm"), which shall, within 30 Business Days of
such submission, determine and report to Shareholder and SJM upon such remaining
disputed items, and such report shall have the legal effect of an arbitral award
and shall be final, binding and conclusive on Shareholder and SJM. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between SJM
and Shareholder in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such
remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm which
is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted. No adjustment to any amount payable by SJM or
Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.2.3 shall be made with respect to amounts
disputed by SJM pursuant to this Section 2.2.4, unless the net effect of the
amounts successfully disputed by SJM in the aggregate (together with the
Non-Disputed Amounts) is to change the Net Book Value reflected on the Closing
Balance Sheet by at least the Designated Amount, in which case such adjustment
shall only be made in an amount equal to any excess over the Designated Amount.
Any amount that is payable under Section 2.2.3, including, without limitation,
any portion thereof that is subject to dispute under this Section 2.2.4 shall be
paid by Shareholder or SJM, as the case may be, in immediately available funds,
within five Business Days following the resolution of such dispute and in an
amount in accordance with such resolution.

2.2.5 In acting under this Agreement, Shareholder's
Accountants, SJM's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

2.2.6 Any payment required to be made by SJM or Shareholder
pursuant to Section 2.2.3 shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the
date of payment on the basis of the average of the daily rate of interest
publicly announced by Citibank, N.A. in New York, New York from time to time as
its base rate from the Closing Date to the date of such payment.

2.2.7 Within 15 Business Days of the date hereof, SJM and
Shareholder shall agree on a form of Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement")

Liabilities for any and all Taxes of Shareholder, the Sellers, their respective
Affiliates, any group of Persons or member of a group of Persons with which
Shareholder, any Seller and/or their respective Affiliates filed or files Tax
Returns on a combined basis and/or any Affiliated Group or member of an

all Taxes of SJM, its Affiliates, any group of Persons or member of a group of
Persons with which SJM and/or its Affiliates files Tax Returns on a combined

which SJM or an SJM Affiliate becomes liable by virtue of its status as a

7.2.2 Sales and Other Tax. SJM will pay, and shall indemnify
and hold the Company, Shareholder and their Affiliates harmless against, up to
$4,000,000 of (a) transfer, documentary, recording, notarial, sales, use,
registration, stamp and other similar taxes, fees and expenses (including, but
not limited to, all applicable stock transfer taxes and real estate transfer
taxes, however computed, including a tax based on the excess of sale price over
original cost) and including any penalties, interest and additions to such tax)
and (b) all expenses incurred in the transfer of intellectual property,
including, without limitation, the cost of all patent and trademark
registrations contemplated hereby, in each case incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and each of Shareholder and
SJM will be responsible for the payment of, and shall indemnify and hold the
other party harmless against 50% of all such amounts in excess of $4,000,000
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that SJM will be solely responsible for the payment
of the Canadian Goods and Services Tax; and provided further that, if allowed by
Canadian law, SJM will be permitted to satisfy its obligation to pay the
Canadian Goods and Services Tax by assigning its claim for a refund of such
taxes to the Shareholder Affiliate. To the extent permitted under applicable
law, SJM shall satisfy its obligation under this Section 7.2.2 by paying
directly to the relevant tax authority (i) first, those taxes and expenses which
are imposed by applicable law solely on SJM or its Affiliates and which SJM
acknowledges at the time of the Closing are due and owing, and (ii) second,
those taxes and expenses which are imposed by applicable law jointly on
Shareholder or its Affiliates and SJM or its Affiliates and which SJM
acknowledges at the time of the Closing are due and owing.

7.2.3 Property Taxes. In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"):

(a) Real, personal and intangible property Taxes and other
similar taxes ("Property Taxes") that are imposed by virtue of the ownership of
assets (as opposed to taxes that are imposed as a result of the transfer of
assets) with respect to the Assets for a Straddle Period shall be divided
between the Tax years (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and a Post-Closing Tax period that begins
the day following the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period"), and the amount
of Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Post-Closing Tax Period,
as the case may be, shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes accrued
(i.e., based upon the date of assessment of such Property Taxes and not upon the
date of payment thereof unless the Tax is related to a definite period of time,
in which case it will be treated as accruing ratably over that period) for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
or a Post-Closing Tax Period, as the case may be, and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the Straddle Period.

(b) Shareholder shall satisfy its obligation in respect of
Taxes for the Straddle Period by paying to SJM the excess of (i) such Straddle
Period Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period over (ii) the sum of such Straddle
Period Taxes paid by Shareholder, the Seller or their respective Affiliates.
Shareholder shall pay, or cause its Affiliate to pay, such excess, if any, to
SJM within thirty (30) days after the date of the Tax Return relating to such
Straddle Period Taxes is required to be filed (or, if later, is actually filed
but no earlier than the later of the date SJM pays its share of Straddle Period
Taxes or, if SJM or an Affiliate is responsible for filing the Tax Return in
question, thirty (30) days after Shareholder has received a copy of the Tax
Return with respect to which the Straddle Period Taxes are owing). If the sum of
such Straddle Period Taxes paid by Shareholder, the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates exceeds the Straddle Period Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, SJM
shall pay, or cause its Affiliate to pay, to Shareholder the amount of such
excess, if any, within thirty (30) days after the date of the Tax Return
relating to such Straddle Period Taxes is required to be filed (or, if later, is
actually filed but no earlier than the later of the date Shareholder pays its
share of Straddle Period Taxes or, if Shareholder or an Affiliate is responsible
for filing the Tax Return in question, thirty (30) days after SJM has received a
copy of the Tax Return with respect to which the Straddle Period Taxes are
owing). Payments to be made pursuant to this paragraph by Shareholder, SJM or
their affiliates with respect to any Straddle Period shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect any final determination (which shall include the execution
of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to Straddle Period Taxes.

7.2.4 Retention of Records. Each of SJM and Shareholder shall
retain (or cause to be retained) all books, records and other data pertaining to
Tax matters for all open periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date other than books, records and data pertaining to Taxes based on or
measured by income, which neither party shall have an obligation to retain for
the benefit of the other. In particular, SJM and Shareholder shall retain (or
cause to be retained) all non-income-tax related Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating thereto with
respect to the operations of the Sellers prior to the Closing Date, until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by SJM or
Shareholder, any extension thereof) of the respective Tax periods and shall not
destroy any such documents thereafter without providing thirty (30) days'
written notice to Shareholder, or to SJM, as the case may be.

7.2.5 Notice; Cooperation. Nothing in this Section 7.2.5 shall
require any party to provide notices or cooperation with respect to matters
pertaining to Taxes that are based on or measured by income. Each of SJM and
Shareholder shall promptly provide written notice to the other upon receiving
(or upon an Affiliate receiving) notice from a taxing authority that additional
non-income Tax liabilities may exist or that any non-income-tax related books or
records have been requested by any taxing authority. SJM and Shareholder
covenant and agree that subsequent to the Closing, upon reasonable notice and
during normal business hours, they and their Affiliates will (i) give the other
party and its representatives information, books and records relevant to the
Sellers to the extent necessary to enable the other party to prepare its
non-income tax related Returns, and (ii) provide the other party or its
Affiliates with such information, books and records as may reasonably be
requested in connection with any non-income-tax related Tax Return, inquiry,
election, audit or other examination by any taxing authority, or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to liability for Taxes. SJM and Shareholder
also shall make available to each other, as reasonably requested, and at the
expense of the requesting party, knowledgeable employees or advisors of the
party or its Affiliates of which the request is made and personnel responsible
for preparing and maintaining information, books, records and documents in
connection with non-income-tax related Tax filings, audits, disputes or
litigation. If Shareholder, SJM or any of their Affiliates pay any Taxes that,
pursuant to this Agreement, are to be borne by another party, such other party
shall promptly reimburse such paying party for the Taxes paid.

7.2.6 Refunds. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
7.2.6, any refunds or credits of Taxes of Shareholder, Sellers or their
Affiliates relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
shall be for the account of Shareholder; provided, however, that any refunds or
credits of Taxes which are accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet or which result
from a payment of any Taxes by SJM or any Affiliate either directly or
indirectly, shall belong to SJM. Any refunds or credits of Taxes relating to any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Shareholder, Sellers and
their Affiliates and SJM and its Affiliates consistently with Section 7.2.3. Any
amounts payable to Shareholder pursuant to this Section 7.2.6 shall be net of
any Tax cost or benefit to SJM or its Affiliates attributable to the receipt of
such refund and/or the payment by SJM of such amounts to Shareholder. Any
amounts payable to SJM pursuant to this Section 7.2.6 shall be net of any Tax
cost or benefit to Shareholder, Sellers or their Affiliates attributable to the
receipt of such refund and/or the payment by Shareholder of such amounts to SJM.
If any party receives any refunds or credits that, pursuant to this Agreement,
are the property of another party, such party shall promptly pay the amount of
such refunds or credits to the other party.

7.2.7 Certain Contest Rights. (a) Promptly after the receipt by
SJM or Shareholder or their respective Affiliates (the "Prospective Indemnitee")
of a written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance which, after the lapse
of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened
commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation with respect to which
indemnity may be sought under this Section 7.2 (an "Asserted Tax Liability"),
the Prospective Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the "Tax Claim Notice") to
the other party (the "Prospective Indemnitor"). The Tax Claim Notice shall
contain factual information (to the extent known to the Prospective Indemnitee)
describing the Asserted Tax Liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Taxing authority with
respect to any such Asserted Tax Liability. If the Prospective Indemnitee fails
to give the Prospective Indemnitor notice of an Asserted Tax Liability as
required by this Section 7.2.3, and if such failure to give notice results in a
detriment to the Prospective Indemnitor, then any amount to which the
Prospective Indemnitor is otherwise required to pay pursuant to Section 7.2 with
respect to the Asserted Tax Liability shall be reduced by the amount of such
detriment.

(b) The Prospective Indemnitor may elect to direct, through
counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, the compromise or contest,
either administratively or in the courts, of any Asserted Tax Liability. If the
Prospective Indemnitor elects to direct the compromise or contest of such
Asserted Tax Liability, it shall within 30 calendar days (or sooner, if the
nature of the Asserted Tax Liability so requires) notify the Prospective
Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Prospective Indemnitee shall
cooperate and shall cause its Affiliates to cooperate, at the Prospective
Indemnitor's expense, in the compromise or contest of such Asserted Tax
Liability. The Prospective Indemnitor may not enter into on behalf of the
Prospective Indemnitee or its Affiliates a settlement agreement with respect to
any Asserted Tax Liability without the written consent of the Prospective
Indemnitee; provided, however, that, if the Prospective Indemnitee does not
grant such consent to the Prospective Indemnitor with respect to the settlement
of an Asserted Tax Liability, the Prospective Indemnitor may satisfy its
indemnity obligation under this Section 7.2 with respect to the Asserted Tax
Liability by paying to the Prospective Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) the amount
which the Prospective Indemnitor (or its Affiliate) would have paid if such
consent had been granted and the Asserted Tax Liability settled pursuant to such
settlement agreement. If the Prospective Indemnitor elects not to direct the
compromise or contest of the Asserted Tax Liability, fails to notify the
Prospective Indemnitee of its election, contests its obligation to indemnify
under this Section 7.2 or if the Prospective Indemnitee refuses to grant consent
to the Prospective Indemnitor to enter into a settlement agreement with respect
to an Asserted Tax Liability, the Prospective Indemnitee or its Affiliates may
pay, compromise or contest such Asserted Tax Liability, and the Prospective
Indemnitor shall cooperate (including granting any necessary powers of attorney)
in such contest. The Prospective Indemnitee's settlement or compromise of an
Asserted Tax Liability under the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence
shall not affect the Prospective Indemnitor's indemnity obligation pursuant to
Section 7.2; provided, however, that the Prospective Indemnitor will not be
obligated to indemnify the Prospective Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) for any
amounts in excess of the amount the Prospective Indemnitor would have paid
pursuant to a settlement agreement if the Prospective Indemnitee had given its
written consent to the Prospective Indemnitor with respect to such settlement
agreement. In any event, the Prospective Indemnitor (or its Affiliates) and the
Prospective Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) may participate, at its own expense,
in the contest of such Asserted Tax Liability. If the Prospective Indemnitor
chooses to direct the compromise or contest of any Asserted Tax Liability, the
Prospective Indemnitee shall promptly empower and shall cause its Affiliates to
promptly empower (by power of attorney and such other documentation as may be
appropriate) such representative of the Prospective Indemnitee as it may
designate to represent the Prospective Indemnitor or its Affiliates in any
audit, claim for refund or administrative or judicial proceeding insofar as such
audit, claim for refund or proceeding involves an Asserted Tax Liability for
which the Prospective Indemnitor would be liable under Section 7.2.

7.2.8 Indemnification. Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold
SJM, Acquisition Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates harmless from and
against any and all Taxes resulting from any breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements of the Shareholder or
its Affiliates contained in this Section 7.2. SJM agrees to indemnify and hold
Shareholder, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates harmless from and
against any and all Taxes resulting from any breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements of SJM or its
Affiliates contained in this Section 7.2. In addition to Taxes, this indemnity
obligation extends to (i) the reasonable costs incurred by the indemnified party
in collecting under this indemnity agreement and (ii) legal fees, but only if
the Prospective Indemnitor fails to acknowledge its indemnity obligation under
this Section 7.2 within 30 days after notification by the Prospective Indemnitee
of the Asserted Tax Liability.

7.3 Liability for Executive Arrangements.

7.3.1 SJM shall on the Closing Date assume any and all
liability directly or indirectly related to the Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan ("SERP"), Employment Agreements, Split Dollar Life Insurance
Agreement, Executive Life Insurance Agreements and Executive Savings Plan listed
on Schedule 7.3 (together, the "Executive Arrangements") and SJM shall assume
all liabilities and perform all obligations of the Company and Shareholder under
the Executive Arrangements; provided, however, that Shareholder shall remain
liable and shall pay directly to such executive the excess, if any, of (i) the
Enhanced Benefit, over (ii) the Alternative Benefit payable under Section 5.2 of
the SERP and, if any interest payable under Section 5.2 or additional amounts
payable pursuant to Section 5.3 of the SERP are due, the portion of the interest
and additional amount that is attributable solely to such excess. On or prior to
the Closing Date, Shareholder shall inform SJM of whether the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a Target Sale of the Company, as
defined in the SERP. SJM shall provide Shareholder with prior written notice of
any claim under the SERP that would give rise to a Shareholder obligation
hereunder and shall provide Shareholder with an opportunity to review, at its
own expense, the calculation of benefits under the SERP.

7.4 Non-Competition.

7.4.1 During the period from the date of this Agreement to and
including the fourth anniversary of the date hereof (or, if not enforceable for
such period in any country, for such shorter period as shall be enforceable in
such country), Shareholder shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates
to, directly or indirectly, engage in the development, marketing, production,
sale or distribution anywhere in the world of Competitive Products (as defined
below).

7.4.2 As used in Section 7.4.1 hereof, the phrase "directly or
indirectly, engage in" includes any direct or indirect ownership, profit
participation or other interest by Shareholder or its Affiliates, whether as
owner, stockholder, partner, joint venturer, beneficiary or otherwise, in any
Person; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not prevent
Shareholder or any of its Affiliates from (a) investing in businesses that
compete with the Competitive Products where such investments are incidental
investments in public companies and constitute, in the aggregate, less than 5%
of the outstanding securities or voting interest of each of such companies, (b)
acquiring businesses an incidental portion (such portion being deemed to be
incidental if the assets, revenues or income relating to the business which
competes with the Competitive Products is less than 5% of the assets, revenues
or income, respectively, of the business being acquired) of the business of
which competes with the Competitive Products (unless the excess over 5% of the
competing portion of such business is divested within six months from the date
of such acquisition) or (c) investing in investment funds or investment
partnerships which in turn invest in companies or entities which may be engaged
in the production, sale or distribution of Competitive Products so long as
neither Shareholder nor any of its Affiliates exercise control over such
investment decisions.

7.4.3 As used in this Section 7.4, (i) "Competitive Products"
means "Cardiac Stimulation Devices" (as defined in Section 13.1) and other
devices performing the same purpose or function as, or that are competitive
with, Cardiac Stimulation Devices, and shall include products intended for use
in or as products that are Cardiac Stimulation Devices (including, without
limitation, parts, components, modules, subsystems or subassemblies thereof, or
parts, components, modules, subsystems or subassemblies of and for, products
intended for use as or products that are Cardiac Stimulation Devices) except to
the extent that they are intended for use in or as products other than Cardiac
Stimulation Devices and (ii) "Affiliate" does not include any Person once it is
no longer an Affiliate of Siemens AG.

7.5 Non-Solicitation. For thirty-six months from the Closing
Date, neither Shareholder nor the Shareholder Affiliate, on the one hand, nor
SJM nor any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall specifically solicit to
hire any current employees of the other party without the prior written consent
of such latter party, provided that nothing herein shall restrict or preclude
the rights of either party to make generalized searches for employees by use of
advertisements in the media (including without limitation, trade media) or by
engaging search firms to engage in searches which are not targeted or focused on
the employees of the other party.

7.6 Siemens Name. Immediately after the Closing, except as
otherwise permitted under the License Agreement referred to in Section 3.2.5,
SJM will take all action necessary to cease the use of the name "Siemens" (or
any variant thereof) and related trademarks, corporate names, and trade names
incorporating the name "Siemens", and any "Siemens" logos and trade dress, in
each case in connection with the conduct of the Business. On the Closing Date,
Shareholder shall take all necessary action to change the name of the Company to
exclude the word "Pace-Setter".

7.7 Confidentiality. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, after the Closing, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall not use or
disclose to third Persons any information disclosed to and transferred and
assigned, licensed or otherwise made available to SJM or its Affiliates in
connection with the Business and transfer of Assets hereunder. Without
limitation, this obligation of confidentiality shall apply to information
related to the Products, business plans, strategies, technologies, and future
business relationships of the Business. This obligation of confidentiality shall
not apply to the extent any such information (a) is or becomes part of the
public domain through no fault of the Sellers (but only after and only to the
extent that it is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain); (b)
after the Closing, comes into the possession of the Sellers from a third Person
who was not, to the Sellers' knowledge, under a continuing obligation of
confidence to the disclosing party; or (c) is disclosed by the Sellers pursuant
to any judicial compulsion, provided that SJM is notified at the time such
judicial action is initiated. Disclosures relating to the Products, business
plans, strategies and future business relationships of SJM or the Company shall
not be deemed to be in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving
party merely because they are embraced (but not disclosed) by general
disclosures in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving party.

7.8 Bulk Sales Laws. The Company shall comply with the
provisions of the "bulk sales" law of the State of California, and otherwise
each of the parties waives compliance by the other parties with the provisions
of the "bulk sales" laws of any jurisdiction which may be applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.9 Guarantee. SJM hereby unconditionally guarantees the
obligations of the SJM Affiliates and Acquisition Subsidiary hereunder.

7.10 Real Estate Inspections. Commencing from the date of this
Asset Purchase Agreement and continuing through the date of Closing, SJM, its
agents, contractors and subcontractors shall have the right to enter upon the
Owned Real Property, at reasonable times (during ordinary business hours) upon
not less than 48 hours' prior notice to the Company, to make such inspections,
surveys and tests of the Real Property and the improvements situated thereon as
SJM may require.

7.11 Real Estate Related Reports. Promptly after the execution
of this Asset Purchase Agreement, Seller shall deliver to SJM, or cause to be
delivered to SJM, copies of all insurance claims and reports relating to the
Owned Real Property which have been submitted to insurance companies since
January 1, 1994, insuring all or portions of the Real Property and all letters,
correspondence and/or reports prepared by or at the request of such insurance
companies that have been delivered to any of Sellers or which Sellers are
entitled to obtain from such insurance companies.

reimburse Acquisition Subsidiary for the out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Business after the Closing Date to repair the damage to the floor in the "clean
room" at the Company's Valley View Court Facility as a result of the January 17,
1994 earthquake, including costs of employees who are idled for a period of time
as a result of the repair of such damage, to the extent that such costs are not
covered by insurance proceeds. After the Closing Date, SJM shall, and shall
cause Acquisition Subsidiary to, use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate the
Losses incurred by the Business as a result of such damage that are not covered
by insurance. After the Closing Date, SJM shall pay to the Shareholder its
allocable portion of any insurance proceeds received by SJM or its Affiliates
under Section 1.1(a)(xxii) for expenses paid by the Company prior to the Closing
Date to repair any damage resulting from such earthquake prior to the Closing
Date to the extent that SJM or its Affiliates receive insurance proceeds after
the Closing Date for such expenses.

INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED MATTERS

10.1 Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions
of this Agreement, the representations and warranties of SJM, the Company and
Shareholder contained herein shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of SJM,
the Company or Shareholder, as the case may be, for a period of one year after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that (A) the representations and warranties
in Sections 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4, 4.1.5, 4.3.1, 4.3.12, 4.3.13, 4.14 and
4.17 shall survive for a period of two years after the Closing Date, (B) the

survive until the adjustment to the Cash Consideration has been resolved
pursuant to Section 2.2, and (C) the representations and warranties in Sections
4.7 and 4.18 shall not survive the Closing.

10.2 Indemnification by Shareholder. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article 10, Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold SJM,
Acquisition Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates, including, in each case,
any of their respective directors, officers, employees and representatives,
harmless from and against:

10.2.1 Any and all Losses resulting from any breach of any of
the representations and warranties (as of the Closing Date), covenants or other
agreements of the Company or Shareholder contained in this Agreement (other than
Sections 7.1 and 7.2, it being understood that the sole remedy for breach
thereof shall be pursuant to Sections 7.1 and 7.2, as the case may be); and

10.2.2 Losses resulting from Excluded Liabilities.

10.3 Indemnification by SJM. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article 10, SJM agrees to indemnify and hold Shareholder and
its Affiliates, including, in each case, any of its or their respective
directors, officers, employees and representatives, harmless from and against:

10.3.1 Any and all Losses resulting from any breach of any
representations and warranties (as of the Closing Date), covenants or agreements
of SJM contained in this Agreement (other than Sections 7.1 and 7.2, it being
understood that the sole remedy for breach thereof shall be pursuant to Sections
7.1 and 7.2, as the case may be); and

10.3.2 Losses resulting from Assumed Liabilities.

10.4 Determination of Damages and Related Matters. In
calculating any amounts payable to SJM, Acquisition Subsidiary and their
respective Affiliates pursuant to Section 10.2 or payable to Shareholder or its
respective Affiliates pursuant to Section 10.3, such amounts shall be limited to
the amount of any Losses that remain after deducting therefrom any insurance
proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or similar payment recoverable from the
indemnified Person from any third party with respect thereto. Any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Section 10 shall be decreased by the amount of the
indemnified Person's Tax benefit (as defined below), and increased by the amount
of the indemnified Person's Tax cost (as defined below). The amount of the
indemnified Person's Tax benefit shall be equal to the amount of the deduction
(or the present value of any increased depreciation or amortization deductions)
resulting from the indemnified Loss, multiplied by the highest marginal federal
income tax rate imposed on the indemnified Person. The amount of the indemnified
Person's Tax cost shall be equal to the amount of the income (or the present
value of any decreased depreciation or amortization deductions) resulting from
the receipt of the indemnity payment, multiplied by the highest marginal federal
tax rate imposed on the indemnified person. For purposes of this Section 10.4,
present values will be computed using the Applicable Federal Rate as the
discount rate. To the extent permitted by law, the parties will treat all
indemnity payments as adjustments to the purchase price and liabilities for
indemnified Losses as having been in existence at the time of the Acquisition.

10.5 Limitation on Indemnification Liabilities. The
indemnification obligations of Shareholder contained in Section 10.2 hereof
shall not be effective until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses which
would otherwise be indemnifiable under Section 10.2 exceeds $8,000,000 (the
"Threshold Amount"), and then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds
the Threshold Amount. The indemnification obligations of Shareholder under
Section 10.2 shall be effective only until the dollar amount paid in respect of
the Losses indemnified against under such Section aggregates to an amount equal
to $120,000,000 (the "Liability Cap"). The Threshold Amount and the Liability
Cap contained in this Section 10.5 shall not apply to any obligations arising
under Sections 2.2.4 and 2.3 regarding fees and expenses, Section 6.1, 6.4.2,
6.5, 6.6, 6.14, Article 7 or Article 12 or to any Losses arising from Excluded
Liabilities.

10.6 Notice of Indemnification. In the event any legal
proceeding shall be threatened or instituted or any claim or demand shall be
asserted by any person in respect of which payment may be sought by one party
hereto from the other party under the provisions of this Agreement, the party
seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall promptly cause written notice
of the assertion of any such claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by
this indemnity to be forwarded to the other party (the "Indemnitor") which
notice, in the case of a claim arising under Section 7.1, 7.2, 10.2 or 10.3,
must be received by the Indemnitor before the expiration of the relevant
survival period set forth in Section 10.1 or if no such period is specified,
until the applicable period under the statute of limitations therefor has
expired. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall state
specifically the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to
which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the
claim, and the amount of the liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason
of the claim.

10.7 Indemnification Procedure for Third-Party Claims. In the
event that an Indemnitee receives written notice of the commencement of any
action or proceeding, the assertion of any claim by a third party or the
imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought
pursuant to this Article 10 (a "Third Party Claim"), and such Indemnitee intends
to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article 10, the Indemnitee shall promptly
provide the Indemnitor with notice of such action, proceeding, claim, penalty or
assessment, and the Indemnitor shall, upon receipt of such notice, be entitled
to participate in or, at the Indemnitor's option, assume the defense, appeal or
settlement of such action, proceeding, claim, penalty or assessment with respect
to which such indemnity has been invoked with counsel of its own choosing, and
the Indemnitee will cooperate fully with the Indemnitor in connection therewith.
In the event that the Indemnitor fails to assume the defense, appeal or
settlement of such action, proceeding, claim, penalty or assessment within 30
days after receipt of notice thereof from the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall
have the right to undertake the appeal of such action, proceeding, claim,
penalty or assessment at the Indemnitor's expense, subject to the rights of the
Indemnitor in the immediately succeeding sentence. If the Indemnitee assumes
such defense and proposes to settle or compromise any such action, proceeding,
claim, penalty or assessment then the Indemnitee shall give written notice
thereof and the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in the settlement
or assume or reassume the defense of such action, proceeding, claim, penalty or
assessment.

11.1.1 by the mutual written consent of the parties; or

11.1.2 by either Shareholder and the Company, on the one hand,

obligations under this Agreement shall have been the reason that the Closing
Date shall not have occurred on or before said date; and provided further that
such date shall be extended until December 31, 1994, if the Closing did not
occur by such date because of the failure of SJM, Shareholder or the Company to

Agreement because of the failure of any applicable waiting period to expire; or

11.1.4 by either Shareholder and the Company, on the one hand,

documents delivered by the parties hereto pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement) or any alleged breach hereof may, at the option of either SJM or
Shareholder, be submitted for discussion and possible resolution by senior
officers of SJM and Shareholder, as designated by their respective chief
executive officers.

(b) Except as provided in Article 2, all disputes arising,
relating to or arising in connection with this Agreement, including those
pertaining to the validity, interpretation, construction or breach hereof or of
any legal obligation owed or claimed to be owed by any party hereto to any other
party hereto or its Affiliates, that is not otherwise amicably settled between
the parties shall exclusively be resolved by arbitration between SJM and
Shareholder pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Rules"), with the arbitration to be conducted in
the English language and taking place in New York, New York.

(c) The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of three
arbitrators appointed in accordance with the Rules. The Chairman of the arbitral
tribunal shall be nominated by the two arbitrators nominated respectively by
Shareholder and SJM, and if they fail to agree upon such Chairman within 30 days
after the second arbitrator has been appointed, such Chairman shall be appointed
by the American Arbitration Association. No arbitrator shall be or have been a
present or past employee, officer, director, legal counsel, consultant or agent
of either party or its Affiliates. All arbitrators shall be of legal education,
unless the parties agree otherwise at the time. Unless prohibited or restricted
by applicable law, each party agrees to provide to the arbitrators and the other
party, subject to a strict confidentiality agreement, such documents, other
evidence, witness testimony as may reasonably be requested by the other party
and as are relevant to the issues being arbitrated. The arbitrators may restrict
or terminate discovery requests which they conclude are unreasonable, unduly
burdensome or not relevant to the issues being arbitrated. Such discovery shall
occur during a reasonable time period. The arbitrators shall not have the power
to act as "amiable compositeurs" with respect to any dispute submitted to such
arbitration, but rather shall make their decision based on their understanding
and interpretation of the applicable law and facts. SJM expressly acknowledges
and agrees that Siemens AG has not in any way agreed to or consented to the
jurisdiction of the federal, state or local courts of the United States for any
purpose whatsoever and shall not be so treated hereunder, and SJM hereby waives
all rights to claim that Siemens AG is subject to such jurisdiction. The fees
and disbursements of the arbitrators shall be allocated between the disputing
party and the other party to the dispute in the same proportion that the
disputed items so submitted to the arbitrators that are unsuccessfully disputed
by each (as finally determined by the arbitrators) bears to the total amount of
all disputed items so submitted. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, (i) any party shall be entitled to seek a judicial order for
interim relief to the extent necessary to safeguard the property that is the
subject matter of an arbitration proceeding hereunder, and (ii) judgment upon
the award rendered in any arbitration proceeding hereunder may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court in a judicial
acceptance of the award and an order by enforcement, as the case may be. The
parties hereto agree that the arbitrators appointed pursuant to this Section
12.8 shall have the power to grant equitable relief, including temporary and
permanent injunctive relief and specific performance.

12.9 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
the applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.

12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one 
or more counterparts, all of which taken together will constitute one and the
same instrument.

12.11 Interpretation. This Agreement has been fully negotiated
by the parties through their legal counsel. Accordingly, in interpreting this
Agreement, the rule of the interpretation requiring that documents be construed
against the draftsman shall be inapplicable.

12.12 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications
to any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given or made (and shall
be deemed to have been duly given or made upon receipt) by delivery in person,

ARTICLE 2

CONSIDERATION AND MANNER OF PAYMENT

2.1 CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT. Subject to Section 2.2, the
aggregate cash consideration paid for the Assets shall be US$110,000,000 (the
"Cash Consideration"). The Cash Consideration shall be paid in full in
immediately available dollar funds at the Closing.

2.2 CASH CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT.

2.2.1 The Cash Consideration shall be subject to adjustment, if
any, after the Closing Date (as defined in Article 3) as specified in this
Section 2.2.

2.2.2 As soon as practicable (but in no event later than 90
calendar days following the Closing Date), Siemens-Elema shall prepare and
deliver to SJM an audited combined balance sheet for the Business (the "Closing
Balance Sheet") as of the Closing Date, together with a supplementary statement
adjusting the combined balance sheet to exclude certain assets and liabilities
which are not to be sold and to include certain other assets and liabilities
which are to be sold, all as set forth on Schedule 2.2.2. In preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet, Siemens-Elema shall in good faith consider all reasonable
audit procedures suggested by SJM, and to the extent such suggested procedures
are acceptable to Siemens-Elema, prepare the Closing Balance Sheet in a manner
consistent therewith. The Deal Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet shall
not include any liability or reserve with respect to any future liabilities
relating to or arising out of the Settlement Agreement. The Closing Balance
Sheet shall be accompanied by the report thereon of Coopers & Lybrand, the
independent accountants of Siemens-Elema ("Siemens-Elema's Accountants"),
stating that the Closing Balance Sheet fairly presents the combined financial
position of the Business at the Closing Date in conformity with Schedule 2.2.2
and otherwise in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (hereinafter referred to as "U.S. GAAP") which Schedule 2.2.2 and
U.S. GAAP shall be applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the
Deal Balance Sheet as defined in Section 4.2. During the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet by Siemens-Elema and the period of any dispute provided
for in Section 2.2.4, SJM shall provide Siemens-Elema and Siemens-Elema's
Accountants reasonable access to the books, records, facilities and employees of
the Business, and SJM, the SJM Affiliates and their respective successors, if
any, shall cooperate fully with SiemensElema's Accountants, in each case to the
extent required by Siemens-Elema and Siemens-Elema's Accountants in order to
prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and to investigate the basis for any such
dispute. SJM and its representatives shall be given reasonable access during
regular business hours and upon reasonable notice to the books, records,
facilities and employees of Siemens-Elema and the Shareholder Affiliates
pertaining to the Business including all supporting documents and auditor's work
papers used in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, as necessary for it
to review the Closing Balance Sheet; provided, however, that any such
investigation shall be conducted in such manner so as not to interfere with the
operations of the Sellers. SJM shall be permitted to observe the physical count
of inventory to be undertaken in preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet.

2.2.3 Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.2.4,
within 30 Business Days after the date of receipt by SJM of the Closing Balance
Sheet:

(i) If the amount of Net Book Value shown on the Closing
Balance Sheet is less than US$58,158,000 by at least US$200,000 (the
"Designated Amount"), Siemens-Elema shall immediately pay to SJM, as an
adjustment to the Cash Consideration, in immediately available dollar
funds, an amount equal to such excess over the Designated Amount; and

(ii) If the amount of Net Book Value shown on the Closing
Balance Sheet is greater than US$58,158,000 by at least the Designated
Amount, SJM shall immediately pay, as an adjustment to the Cash
Consideration, in immediately available dollar funds, to Siemens-Elema
an amount equal to such excess over the Designated Amount.

2.2.4 If not disputed by SJM in accordance with this Section
2.2.4, the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Siemens-Elema to SJM shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. SJM may dispute any amounts
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet to the extent that the net effect of such
disputed amounts in the aggregate would be to change the Net Book Value
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet by more than the Designated Amount, but
only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet were
not arrived at in accordance with Schedule 2.2.2 and otherwise in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, or that the adjustments set forth in Schedule 2.2.2 or U.S. GAAP
were not applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Deal Balance
Sheet; provided, however, that SJM shall notify Siemens-Elema and
Siemens-Elema's Accountants in writing of each disputed item, specifying the
amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in detail, the basis for such
dispute, within 30 Business Days of SJM's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet.
In the event of such a dispute, each of Siemens-Elema and SJM shall negotiate in
good faith to reconcile their differences. If such dispute has not been resolved
within 10 Business Days after the notice referred to in the preceding sentence
has been given, Ernst & Young ("SJM's Accountants") and Siemens-Elema's
Accountants shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by
them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties hereto. If any such resolution by SJM's Accountants and Siemens-Elema's
Accountants leaves in dispute amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate
(together with any amounts originally disputed by SJM but no longer in dispute
("Non-Disputed Amounts")) would not be to change the Net Book Value reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet by at least the Designated Amount, all the amounts
remaining in dispute shall then be deemed to have been resolved in favor of the
Closing Balance Sheet, and such resolution shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. If SJM's Accountants and Siemens-Elema's
Accountants are unable to reach a resolution, leaving in dispute amounts the net
effect of which in the aggregate (together with Non-Disputed Amounts) would
change the Net Book Value reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet by at least the
Designated Amount, SJM's Accountants and Siemens-Elema's Accountants shall
submit the items remaining in dispute that SJM shall be entitled to dispute by
the terms of this Section 2.2.4 for resolution to Deloitte & Touche or such
other independent accounting firm of international reputation as may be mutually
acceptable to Siemens-Elema and SJM (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), which
shall, within 30 Business Days of such submission, determine and report to
Siemens-Elema and SJM upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall
have the legal effect of an arbitral award and shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Siemens-Elema and SJM. The fees and disbursements of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between SJM and Siemens-Elema in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm which is unsuccessfully disputed
by each such party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm)
bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted. No
adjustment to any amount payable by SJM or Siemens-Elema pursuant to Section
2.2.3 shall be made with respect to amounts disputed by SJM pursuant to this
Section 2.2.4, unless the net effect of the amounts successfully disputed by SJM
in the aggregate (together with the Non-Disputed Amounts) is to change the Net
Book Value reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet by at least the Designated
Amount, in which case such adjustment shall only be made in an amount equal to
any excess over the Designated Amount. Any amount that is payable under Section
2.2.3, including, without limitation, any portion thereof that is subject to
dispute under this Section 2.2.4 shall be paid by Siemens-Elema or SJM, as the
case may be, in immediately available dollar funds, within five Business Days
following the resolution of such dispute and in an amount in accordance with
such resolution.

2.2.5 In acting under this Agreement, Siemens-Elema's
Accountants, SJM's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

2.2.6 Any payment required to be made by SJM or Siemens-Elema
pursuant to Section 2.2.3 shall bear interest from the Closing Date through the
date of payment on the basis of the average of the daily rate of interest
publicly announced by Citibank, N.A. in New York, New York from time to time as
its base rate for dollars from the Closing Date to the date of such payment.

2.3 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. (a) As promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date,
SJM shall deliver to SiemensElema a preliminary proposed allocation of the Cash
Consideration and Assumed Liabilities among the countries in which the Business
is conducted and the respective Sellers are located.

(b) As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the
later of (i) 90 calendar days following the Closing Date and (ii) thirty days
after the Closing Balance Sheet is finally resolved), SJM shall deliver to
Siemens-Elema a proposed allocation of the Cash Consideration and the Assumed
Liabilities reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet among the countries in which
the Business is conducted and the Sellers are located and, where appropriate,
among the Assets located in such countries.

(c) SJM and Siemens-Elema agree to negotiate in good faith
regarding the allocation referred to in subsections (a) and (b) above as
promptly as practicable. If SJM and Siemens-Elema are unable (despite good faith
negotiations) to agree upon an allocation within 150 days after the Closing
Date, SJM and Siemens-Elema shall each be individually responsible for
performing its own allocation.

7.1.1 IN GENERAL. Except as provided on Schedule 4.11, as of
the Closing Date, SJM and an SJM Affiliate shall employ (where employment
continues by operation of law) or, where employment does not continue by
operation of law, shall offer employment to, each Employee listed on Schedule
4.11 employed on terms which are not less favorable to such Employee, taken as a
whole, as the terms in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each such
Employee who continues in employment by operation of law or who accepts an offer
of employment pursuant to this Section 7.1.1 is hereafter referred to as a
"Transferred Employee." Siemens-Elema shall indemnify and hold harmless SJM, and
any SJM Affiliate for any Losses as a result of any severance, termination
indemnity, compensation, or other benefit or amount under any Employee Benefit
Plan with respect to:

(a) any Employee who is not a Transferred Employee;

(b) any Employee who would otherwise be a Transferred Employee,
but who withholds his individual consent or objects to the transfer
under local labor law and thus refuses to become an employee of SJM or
an SJM Affiliate, as the case may be; and

(c) any former Employee who terminated employment for any
reason prior to or on the Closing Date.

7.1.2 LIABILITY FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. As of the Closing
Date, SJM or the appropriate SJM Affiliate shall assume the Employee Benefit
Plans listed on Schedule 7.1.2 which they are required under the laws of the
applicable jurisdictions to assume or which they, with the consent of
Siemens-Elema and the Shareholder Affiliates, as appropriate, have agreed to
assume (the "Assumed Employee Benefit Plans"). SiemensElema and the Shareholder
Affiliates agree to do all things reasonably necessary to accomplish the
assumption of the Assumed Employee Benefit Plans, including, with respect to
private plans, the transfer to SJM or the designated SJM Affiliate of insurance
contracts and other assets to fully fund the Benefit Obligations of the Sellers
under such plans as of the Closing Date, and shall not withhold their consent if
such Employee Benefit Plans are capable, under the laws of the applicable
jurisdictions, of being assumed.

7.1.3 Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any person, firm or corporation, other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

Affiliate to, indemnify, save and hold harmless SJM and the SJM Affiliates and
the Affiliates of any of them from and against any and all Losses arising under:

(a) any Employee Benefit Plan maintained or contributed to by
SiemensElema or the Shareholder Affiliates, other than any Employee
Benefit Plan and obligations assumed by SJM and the SJM Affiliates
pursuant to Section 7.1.2 above, regardless of whether the Losses
relate to or arise out of conditions, events or transactions which
exist or occur prior to, on or after the Closing Date; and

(b) any Employee Benefit Plan and obligations assumed by SJM or
the SJM Affiliates pursuant to Section 7.1.2 above, to the extent such
Losses relate to or arise out of conditions, events or transactions
which exist or occur on or prior to the Closing Date. SJM shall, or
shall cause a SJM Affiliate to, indemnify, save and hold harmless
Siemens-Elema and the Shareholder Affiliates from and against any and
all Losses related to Employee Benefit Plans and obligations assumed by

extent such Losses relate to or arise out of conditions, events or
transactions which exist or occur following the Closing Date.

hold the other party and its Affiliates harmless against, 50% of all transfer,
documentary, recording, notarial, sales, use, registration, stamp and other
similar taxes, fees and expenses (including, but not limited to, all applicable
stock transfer or real estate transfer taxes and including any penalties,
interest and additions to such tax), incurred in connection with this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Sellers and SJM and the SJM Affiliates shall cooperate in timely making and
filing all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with the provisions of laws
relating to such taxes. SJM or an SJM Affiliate will bear 100% of any value
added tax (VAT) imposed with respect to its purchase of the Assets; provided,
however, that the relevant SJM Affiliate will be entitled to a credit for such
VAT against such SJM Affiliate's VAT obligation and provided further that where
allowed by local law, SJM or the relevant SJM Affiliate will be permitted to
satisfy its obligation to pay VAT by assigning its claim for a refund of such
VAT to the applicable Seller.

7.3.1 During the period from the date of this Agreement to and
including the fourth anniversary of the date hereof (or, if not enforceable for
such period in any country, for such shorter period as shall be enforceable in
such country), Siemens-Elema shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, engage in the development, marketing,
production, sale or distribution anywhere in the world of Competitive Products
(as defined below).

7.3.2 As used in Section 7.3.1 hereof, the phrase "directly or
indirectly, engage in" includes any direct or indirect ownership, profit
participation or other interest by Siemens-Elema or its Affiliates, whether as
owner, stockholder, partner, joint venturer, beneficiary or otherwise, in any
Person; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not prevent
Siemens-Elema or any of its Affiliates from (a) investing in businesses that
compete with the Competitive Products where such investments are incidental
investments in public companies and constitute, in the aggregate, less than 5%
of the outstanding securities or voting interest of each of such companies, (b)
acquiring businesses an incidental portion (such portion being deemed to be
incidental if the assets, revenues or income relating to the business which
competes with the Competitive Products is less than 5% of the assets, revenues
or income, respectively, of the business being acquired) of the business of
which competes with the Competitive Products (unless the excess over 5% of the
competing portion of such business is divested within six months from the date
of such acquisition) or (c) investing in investment funds or investment
partnerships which in turn invest in companies or entities which may be engaged
in the production, sale or distribution of Competitive Products so long as
neither Siemens-Elema nor any of its Affiliates exercise control over such
investment decisions.

7.3.3 As used in this Section 7.3, (i) "Competitive Products"
means "Cardiac Stimulation Devices" (as defined in Section 13.1) and other
devices performing the same purpose or function as, or that are competitive
with, Cardiac Stimulation Devices, and shall include products intended for use
in or as products that are Cardiac Stimulation Devices (including, without
limitation, parts, components, modules, subsystems or subassemblies thereof, or
parts, components, modules, subsystems or subassemblies of and for, products
intended for use as or products that are Cardiac Stimulation Devices) except to
the extent that they are intended for use in or as products other than Cardiac
Stimulation Devices and (ii) "Affiliate" does not include any Person once it is
no longer an Affiliate of Siemens AG.

7.4 NON-SOLICITATION. For thirty-six months from the Closing
Date, neither Siemens-Elema nor any Shareholder Affiliate, on the one hand, nor
SJM nor any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall specifically solicit to
hire any current employees of the other party without the prior written consent
of such latter party, provided that nothing herein shall restrict or preclude
the rights of either party to make generalized searches for employees by use of
advertisements in the media (including without limitation, trade media) or by
engaging search firms to engage in searches which are not targeted or focused on
the employees of the other party.

7.5 SIEMENS NAME. Immediately after the Closing, except as
otherwise permitted under the License Agreement referred to in Section 3.2.3,
SJM will take, and will cause each SJM Affiliate to take, all action necessary
to cease the use of the name "Siemens" (or any variant thereof) and related
trademarks, corporate names, and trade names incorporating the name "Siemens",
and any "Siemens" logos and trade dress, in each case in connection with the
conduct of the Business. Effective upon the Closing, Siemens-Elema shall cause
the Shareholder Affiliate in France and its shareholders to take all necessary
action to change its name to exclude the word "Pacesetter."

7.6 CONFIDENTIALITY. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, after the Closing Sellers and their Affiliates shall not use or
disclose to third parties any information disclosed to and transferred and
assigned, licensed or otherwise made available to SJM or its Affiliates in
connection with the Business and transfer of Assets hereunder. Without
limitation, this obligation of confidentiality shall apply to information
related to the Products, business plans, strategies, technologies, and future
business relationships of the Business. This obligation of confidentiality shall
not apply to the extent any such information (a) is or becomes part of the
public domain through no fault of Sellers (but only after and only to the extent
that it is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain); (b) after
the Closing comes into the possession of Sellers from a third party who was not,
to Sellers' knowledge, under a continuing obligation of confidence to the
disclosing party; or (c) is disclosed by Sellers pursuant to judicial
compulsion, provided that disclosing party is notified at the time such judicial
action is initiated. Disclosures relating to the Products, business plan,s
strategies and future business relationships of SJM or the Sellers shall not be
deemed to be in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving party
merely because they are embraced (but not disclosed) by general disclosures in
the public domain or the possession of the receiving party.

7.7 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Regarding accounts receivable sold as
part of the Assets sold hereunder, SJM may, by written notice given to
Siemens-Elema at any time prior to one year after the Closing Date, sell back to

all such accounts receivable not collected because they were not at the Closing
Date documented by invoices and accompanying documentation as required to permit
and support collection in accordance with national, provincial and local law or
regulation. SJM shall deliver to Siemens-Elema an assignment of such accounts
receivable to be sold back to Siemens-Elema, and Siemens-Elema shall deliver to
SJM immediately available funds in the amount of such accounts receivable within
30 days after the date of SJM's written notice referred to above. Following such

notice, in the case of a claim arising under Section 7.1, 7.2, 10.2 or 10.3,
must be received by the Indemnitor before the expiration of the relevant
survival period set forth in Section 10.1. Any notice of a claim by reason of
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement shall state specifically the representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement with respect to which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to
an alleged basis for the claim, and the amount of the liability asserted against
the Indemnitor by reason of the claim.

10.6 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE FOR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. In the
event that an Indemnitee receives written notice of the commencement of any
action or proceeding, the assertion of any claim by a third party or the

pursuant to this Article 10 (a "Third-Party Claim"), and such Indemnitee intends
to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article 10, the Indemnitee shall promptly
provide the Indemnitor with notice of such action, proceeding, claim, penalty or
assessment, and the Indemnitor shall, upon receipt of such notice, be entitled

have the right to undertake the appeal of such action, proceeding, claim,
penalty or assessment at the Indemnitor's expense, subject to the rights of the
Indemnitor in the immediately succeeding sentence. If the Indemnitee assumes
such defense and proposes to settle or compromise any such action, proceeding,

of itself and the Shareholder Affiliates hereby waives, and neither SJM nor any
of its Affiliates shall be obligated to comply with, any applicable statutory
provision requiring SJM or any of its Affiliates to examine the Business or any
of the Assets after receipt and to notify Sellers without delay of any defect
discovered. The parties hereby agree that any claims hereunder may be made at
any time during the applicable survival period.

defend and/or hold harmless any Person pursuant to any provision of this Article
10 shall have the right to cure, within a reasonable time and in a manner
