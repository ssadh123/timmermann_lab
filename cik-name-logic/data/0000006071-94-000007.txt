ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on February 17, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames" 
or the "Company") will distribute, to certain of its banks, potential 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of its 
financial plan (referred to herein as the "Plan") for the fiscal year 
ending January 28, 1995 ("Fiscal 1995"). The Plan is attached hereto 
as Exhibit 20 and is incorporated by reference herein. The Plan 
assumes, among other things, that the same financing terms that are 
effective under the Company's current credit agreement, including the 
required cash collateralization of outstanding letters of credit, 
will remain effective for all of Fiscal 1995. The current credit 
agreement expires on December 28, 1994 and the Company has started 
discussions to obtain long-term financing that would extend beyond 
that date. 

As reported in a press release on January 28, 1994, there was a 
partial roof collapse on that date at the Company's distribution 
center in Leesport, PA. The collapse involved approximately 10,000 
square feet of the total 1.2 million square feet in the facility. On 
February 11, 1994, there was a further 20,000 square foot collapse of 
the roof in an area immediately adjacent to the first collapse. The 
Leesport facility remains closed while the extent of the damage is 
assessed and pending determination of what remedial steps are 
required with regard to the roof. The Company has obtained temporary 
warehouse space within a short distance from Leesport and is also 
operating additional shifts at its other distribution centers in 
Mansfield and Clinton, MA. The Company believes that these steps 
will enable it to provide an adequate supply of merchandise to its 
stores in the immediately foreseeable future. As a result of the 
closing of the Leesport facility, the Company may experience an 
increase in its short- term borrowings for a brief period of time as 
it repurchases certain inventory that is temporarily not removable 
from Leesport (see also footnote (A) - Page 7). While the 
investigation into the Leesport situation in still in its early 
stages, the Company currently believes that a substantial portion of 
any damages and any incremental expenses it may incur should be 
recoverable. The net financial effect from the Leesport situation is 
not yet determinable. The Plan does not reflect any financial effect 
as a result of the roof damage at the Leesport facility.

Ames is distributing the Plan to its banks, potential lenders, 
principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their credit 
analyses. The Plan SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE 
and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for 
the fiscal year ended January 30, 1993, the Company's most recent 
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 30, 1993, and the Company's 
Form 10-K to be filed for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. 
The Plan is being reported publicly solely because it is being 
distributed to a large number of the Company's vendors for purposes 
of their credit analyses.

<PAGE>

Although Ames is publishing the Plan and currently expects to report 
its monthly results during Fiscal 1995, Ames does not believe it is 
obligated to provide such information indefinitely, other than as 
required by applicable regulations, and may cease making such 
disclosures and updates at any time. Moreover, Ames does not believe 
that it is obligated to update the Plan to reflect subsequent events 
or developments. 

The Plan was not prepared with a view toward compliance with the 
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants or the rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission regarding financial projections. While presented 
with numerical specificity, the Plan is based upon a variety of 
assumptions that may not be realized and is subject to significant 
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, 
many of which are beyond the control of Ames. Consequently, the Plan 
should not be regarded as a representation or warranty by Ames, or 
any other person, that the forecasts contained therein will be 
realized. Actual results may vary materially from those presented in 
the Plan. 

In its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 30, 1993, the Company 
reported that it and its independent accountants were in discussions 
with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
regarding their review of the Company's applications of the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of 
Position 90-7 ("SOP 90-7"). Those discussions have now concluded and 
the Company will not amend its applications of SOP 90-7 as a result 
of such discussions.

(A) Estimated incremental borrowings that may be required to replace certain inventories at the Leesport facility are between $5 and
$20 million for February through May. The extent and duration of such incremental borrowings is dependent upon the vendor trade
terms on the inventory repurchases and the Company's abilities to access the current inventory at Leesport.
(B) Includes certain projected reclassifications of long-term debt to current debt based upon the Company's current debt structure.
