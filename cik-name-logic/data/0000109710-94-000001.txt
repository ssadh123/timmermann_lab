CLARK REPORTS PROFITABLE 1993;
SIGNI FICANTLY IMPROVED RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS

SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, January 26, 1994 -- Clark Equipment Company (NYSE:
CKL) today announced net income of $48 million, or $2.76 per share,
for 1993. Included in 1993 results is a gain of $6.2 million, or
$0.35 per share, related to a change in accounting for income taxes
from the Company's investment in VME Group N.V. These results compare
to 1992 net income of $66 million, or $3.81 per share, which included a
one-time benefit of $92 million for an accounting change for deferred
taxes and a $1.5 million net benefit from the sale and operating losses
of Clark's forklift truck business. Sales for 1993 were $874.9
million, up 9 percent from $802.7 million in 1992. The announcement
was made by Leo J. McKernan, Clark chairman, president, and chief
executive officer.

Commenting on the year's performance, Mr. McKernan said, "Our operating
businesses made solid gains in 1993. Clark consolidated operations,
which include Melroe, Clark-Hurth Components, and Clark Automotive
Products, delivered profits of $34 million, up 68 percent from $20.2
million in 1992, on a 9 percent sales increase. Similarly, the
performance of VME Group N.V., Clark's 50-percent-owned joint venture,
improved $55.9 million, with Clark's share of net operating income
rising to $7.8 million, despite a 9 percent sales decline." In 1992,
Clark's share of VME's losses was $48.1 million.

In fourth quarter 1993, Clark recorded net income of $18.4 million, or
$1.06 per share, on sales of $220.3 million, compared to a loss of $2.8
million, or $0.16 per share, on sales of $191.3 million in the prior-
year period. There was substantial improvement in the operating
earnings of Clark consolidated businesses and VME. There was no LIFO
income in 1993, compared to $1.8 million in fourth quarter 1992.

Two special charges combined to lower Clark 1993 fourth quarter net
income by $5.2 million. These included (1) an expense related to stock
appreciation rights due to an increase in Clark's share price and (2) a
charge to field retrofit one skid-steer loader model with an additional
hydraulic lock-out system to prevent potential misuse. The negative
impact of these special charges was reduced by decreased provisions for
taxes in the fourth quarter related to Clark's ability to utilize
capital loss carryforwards in the U.S. and Brazil.

Incoming orders in the fourth quarter 1993 were $207 million, compared
to $224 million in third quarter 1993 and $147 million in fourth
quarter 1992. Order backlogs at December 31, 1993, were $146 million,
compared to $123 million at year-end 1992.

Commenting on the results of Clark's consolidated businesses, Mr.
McKernan said, "Clark-Hurth's fourth quarter sales were flat compared
to the third quarter. The European recession was largely responsible
for reducing overall 1993 sales by more than 10 percent. However,
during the fourth quarter, incoming order and backlog trends improved,
especially in the European axle and transmission businesses. Even
though the market outlook is relatively flat again in 1994, Clark-Hurth
has reduced its breakeven level significantly and should be profitable
at 1993 sales volumes." 

Regarding Brazil-based Clark Automotive Products, Mr. McKernan said,
"The business remained profitable, even with the normal seasonal fourth
quarter sales decline. Sales, orders, and earnings for fourth quarter
1993 increased compared to the prior-year period." The automotive,
light truck, and industrial sectors in Brazil also continued to improve
compared to 1992. The agricultural tractor and heavy truck sectors also
grew, but remained well below normal sales levels. Improved sales of
replacement parts also benefited margins.

"At Melroe, sales and orders increased compared to an unusually strong
third quarter," said Mr. McKernan. "This growth is coming from the
strong North American market, where industry fourth quarter retail
sales were up by more than 20 percent over 1992. In 1993, Melroe
market share also improved over 1992." He added that the strength in
North American markets was partially offset by the continued
deterioration in Europe, where skid-steer sales declined. Bobcat mini-

excavator 1993 sales increased, as the product line made continued
headway in North America and Europe. 

Discussing the performance of VME Group, Mr. McKernan noted, "Clark's
share of VME's net income increased to $10.3 million in the fourth
quarter from $1.8 million in the third quarter and a reported loss of
$7.4 million in fourth quarter 1992. Sales improved in Scandinavia,
North America, and Brazil over the third quarter, offsetting continuing
weakness in most European markets. Fourth quarter 1993 sales were
virtually unchanged from the prior-year period, reflecting substantial
margin gains from cost reduction efforts in 1992 and 1993 and the
devaluation of the Swedish Krona."

Mr. McKernan also noted that VME strengthened its worldwide position in
mining equipment markets by forming a joint venture with Hitachi
Construction Machinery in the rigid hauler business. Hitachi, which
holds a substantial minority ownership in the venture, will distribute
rigid haulers in Japan and select markets in Asia and Oceania. Hitachi
will also distribute VME's Volvo BM line of articulated haulers and
large wheel loaders in Japan.

Looking ahead, Mr. McKernan said, "We're cautiously optimistic about
1994. While we expect earnings for first quarter 1994 to be below
fourth quarter 1993 for seasonal reasons, first quarter results should
improve compared to the prior-year period. Clark operations will make
performance gains in 1994, even if markets remain flat during the 
remainder of the year. Results will improve as our businesses continue
to benefit from previous cost reduction programs. When worldwide
markets strengthen, particularly in Europe, we expect further gains in
financial performance."

Clark Equipment Company's business is the design, manufacture, and sale
of skid-steer loaders, construction machinery, transmissions for on-
highway vehicles, and axles and transmissions for off-highway
equipment.
