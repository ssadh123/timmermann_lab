JAMES RIVER REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 1994 RESULTS

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, July 21, 1994 -- James River
Corporation today reported sales and earnings for its second quarter
which ended June 26, 1994. Sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion,
equivalent to the prior year and up approximately 8% above sales of
$1.1 billion in the first quarter of this year. The company reported
net income of $12.9 million for the quarter, slightly below the prior
year, but significantly above the net loss of $7.1 million reported
in the first quarter. On a per share basis after preferred
dividends, earnings of $.06 per share were equal to those of the
prior year's second quarter and improved over the loss of $.19 per
share reported in the first quarter of this year.
Results for the second quarter of 1994 included $9.0
million of non-recurring interest income ($5.4 million after taxes,
or $.07 per share) on the favorable settlement of certain prior
years' income tax returns. Last year's second quarter also included
non-recurring other income of approximately $6.7 million ($4.1
million after taxes, or $.05 per share).
Income from operations totaled $42.5 million, equivalent to
the second quarter of 1993 and more than double the $20.3 million
reported in the first quarter of this year. The upturn from the
first quarter reflects continuing improvements in profitability in
both the Consumer Products and the Food and Consumer Packaging
Businesses, offset in part by the continuing weaknesses in pricing
experienced by the Communications Papers Business.
Operating income for the Consumer Products Business totaled
$47 million, representing increases of 39% compared to last year's
second quarter and 66% compared to first quarter levels. This also
represents the highest level of quarterly profitability for this
business since 1991, driven principally by the company's cost
reduction efforts, as well as strong retail tabletop volumes. While
price increases in commercial tissue products have been announced for
the third quarter, pricing in both retail tissue and tabletop
markets remained competitive during the quarter. Operating income of
$34.3 million for the Food and Consumer Packaging Business
represented improvements of 16% and 29%, respectively, over profits
reported last year and in the first quarter. Operating losses in the
Communications Papers Business widened slightly to $26.5 million,
compared to losses of $25.1 million in the first quarter and $12.3
million in last year's second quarter. Price increases in uncoated
free sheet and other grades were being implemented at the close of
the second quarter, however, average pricing for the second quarter
was below that of the first quarter.
As part of its ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness
of manufacturing operations and reduce costs, the company announced
plans for the closure of its Sandston, Virginia specialty foodservice
plant. Production from this facility will be consolidated at other
company facilities.
On July 5, 1994, subsequent to the end of the quarter,
James River completed the acquisition of an additional 43.2% indirect
ownership interest in Jamont N.V. for a total purchase price of
approximately $575 million. This transaction increased James River's
ownership interest from 43.2% to 86.4% and will result in the
consolidation of Jamont beginning in the third quarter. With annual
sales of $1.5 billion , Jamont is the number two European producer of
towel and tissue products. One-half of the purchase price was
financed with the proceeds from a new series of preferred stock
issued early in the third quarter. The balance of the purchase price
has been financed with a combination of borrowings under existing and
new lines of credit. These borrowings may be refinanced with a
portion of James River's existing $600 million shelf registration of
debt securities.
The Series P 9% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock was
issued as a Dividend Enhanced Convertible Stock ("DECS"), in the form
of depositary shares, with each depositary share representing a one-
hundredth interest in a share of the preferred stock. A total of
16.7 million depositary shares were issued, for total gross proceeds
of $287.5 million, after reflecting the exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option. The DECS are convertible into common stock at
the option of the holder, at any time, at a rate of .8547 common
shares for each depositary share and are redeemable by the company
beginning in July 1997 at a call price payable in shares of common
stock. If still outstanding, the DECS will automatically convert
into common shares on a one-for-one basis in July 1998.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Jamont, James River will
continue to be comprised of three independent business segments.
The Consumer Products Business is the largest of these, with
worldwide annual sales of $4 billion, or over 60% of total James
River sales. This business produces premium towel and tissue and
tabletop products for both U.S. and European markets. The Food and
Consumer Packaging Business with annual sales of $1.6 billion
represents approximately 25% of total sales, and the Communications
Papers Business with annual sales of $.9 billion represents slightly
less than 15% of total sales. Looking ahead, Bob Williams, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, noted that James River will continue to
pursue strategies and structures to enhance recognition of the market
values of these businesses.
He concluded, "We are encouraged by the progress we have
been able to make, particularly in Consumer Products and Food and
Consumer Packaging, through aggressive cost reduction and focused
productivity improvements, while increasing the output of new and
improved products. As increasing pulp prices drive increasing prices
for paper, board, and converted products, the value of James River's
integrated position should be reflected in further increases in
profitability."
