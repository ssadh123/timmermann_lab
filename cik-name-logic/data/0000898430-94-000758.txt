EXHIBIT 1

PRESS RELEASE
CITADEL HOLDING CORPORATION

Glendale, California.......Steve Wesson, the President and Chief Executive 
Officer of Citadel Holding Corporation ("Citadel"), announced today that Citadel
has reached agreement with Fidelity Federal Bank, FSB ("Fidelity") as to the 
number of shares of Class B Common Stock to be retained by Citadel incident to 
the recently completed restructuring and recapitalization of Fidelity. Citadel 
will retain 4,202,243 shares of Class B Common Stock representing approximately 
16.18 percent of the outstanding shares of Fidelity, Citadel continues to be the
largest single holder of Fidelity stock and a registered savings and loan 
holding company, subject to examination and regulation by the Office of Thrift 
Supervision.

In other developments, as part of Fidelity's restructuring, Citadel had 
agreed to reimburse Fidelity with respect to certain environmental and 
structural representations made in bulk asset sales by Fidelity up to a limit of
$4 million. Citadel has been advised by Fidelity that claims in the amount of 
approximately $3.9 milion have been asserted, to date, against Fidelity with 
respect to those representations and warranties. Citadel is further advised 
that these claims are currently being examined by Fidelity, and that no final 
determination has been made as to the extent, if any, of Fidelity's ultimate 
liability with respect to these claims.

Citadel has settled its previously disclosed claim against its directors 
and officers insurance carrier for a cash payment of $2.5 million.

American Express, which occupies approximately 100,098 square feet, 
representing approximately 58 percent of the net rentable area in the Company's 
office property in Phoenix, Arizona, has announced that it intends to close down
the operations currently housed in that structure at or about the end of the 
lease term in February 1997.

Citadel has determined to exercise its option to acquire and lease back to 
Fidelity the office properties located at 600 North Brand Blvd. in Glendale and 
14445 Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks, and is currently exploring various 
possible sources of financing for these acquisitions. The aggregate exercise 
price for the two buildings is approximately $9.75 million. In addition, it is 
estimated that the parking structure associated with the Brand Blvd. property, 
which was damaged in the Northridge Earthquake, will require repairs which may 
cost as much as $1 million.

Citadel has scheduled its stockholders meeting for December 12, 1994 in 
Los Angeles, California, and established a record date of November 4, 1994 for 
that meeting.

A copy of this press release is being filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission as a report of Form 8-K. While it is not the Company's 
practice to issue press releases with respect to operational aspects of its 
real estate assets or pending real estate transaction, the Company believes that
an exception is appropriate in this case in order to provide stockholders with a
balanced picture of the Company's current asset composition in light of recent 
developments such as the finalization of the size of Citadel's ongoing interest 
in Fidelity and the recent settlement of Citadel's claims against its directors 
and officers liability insurance carrier.

Citadel shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol 
CDL.
