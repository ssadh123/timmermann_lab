Item 4 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

On August 18, 1994, the Registrant engaged the firm of Arthur
Andersen LLP as the Registrant's independent accountant for the year
ended June 30, 1995. Form 8-K was filed on August 23, 1994 to
report this change in the Registrant's certifying accountant. The
change in accountants was recommended by the Audit Committee of the
Registrant and approved by the Board of Directors. Prior to that
date, the firm of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. had been the Registrant's
independent accountant. On August 18, 1994, Coopers & Lybrand
L.L.P. confirmed through a letter to the Registrant and to the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the Board of Directors
decided to cease the client-auditor relationship between the
Registrant and Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P.

Neither of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P.'s reports on the financial
statements for the Registrant's 1994 and 1993 fiscal years contained
any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, or was qualified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except for the
changes in accounting resulting from the adoption of Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 106 and 109, with which Coopers
& Lybrand L.L.P. concurs and which changes are referred to in their
report. The Registrant has requested that Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P.
furnish it with a letter, addressed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, stating whether it agrees with the statements made by
the Registrant in response to this Item 4 and, if not, stating the
respects in which it does not agree. A copy of Coopers & Lybrand
L.L.P.'s letter to the Commission is filed as Exhibit 16 to this
report.

In connection with its audits for the Registrant's 1994 and 1993
fiscal years, there were no disagreements with Coopers & Lybrand on
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures that, if not
resolved to their satisfaction, would have caused them to make
reference in connection with their opinion to the subject matter of
the disagreement(s).

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits

(c) Exhibit 16

Letter of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. Agreeing with the Statements in
Form 8-K

This letter will be mailed with the conforming copy of this
electronic filing.
