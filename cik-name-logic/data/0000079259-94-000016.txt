ELKINS PARK, PA - November 17, 1994 . . . Mortgage and Realty Trust
(NYSE:MRT) announced today that it had reached an agreement in principle with a
substantial number of holders of MRT's Senior Secured Uncertificated Notes due
1995 on the terms of a restructuring of the Secured Notes.

Pursuant to the agreement in principle, holders of the Secured Notes in
the aggregate principal amount of $290 million plus accrued interest of $41.7
million through December 31, 1994 will receive under a prepackaged plan of
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as
amended, $110 million of new senior secured notes due 2002, approximately $50
million in cash and 97% of the restructured equity of MRT (or substantially all
the restructured equity if holders of MRT's outstanding common shares do not
vote to accept the prepackaged plan). If holders of MRT's outstanding common
shares vote to accept the prepackaged plan, such holders will retain 3% of the
equity of the restructured MRT. The agreement in principle anticipates that
the new senior secured notes will mature in 2002 and bear interest at the rate
of 11-1/8% per annum. It is also anticipated that holders of unsecured claims
will receive cash in the allowed amount of their claims. It is contemplated
that MRT will prepare a "shelf" registration statement for the new securities
issued pursuant to the prepackaged plan.

MRT's agreement to pursue the restructuring proposal is subject to a
number of conditions and MRT intends to effect the restructuring through a
"prepackaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At this time there can be no assurance
that MRT will receive such support for the restructuring or that the other
conditions to consummation of the proposed restructuring will be satisfied.

Other details of the agreement, including the additional conditions to
commencement and consummation of the restructuring, were not announced pending
the filing of proxy solicitation materials with the SEC and distribution of a
disclosure statement for the solicitation of votes for the prepackaged plan to
holders of MRT's outstanding securities. No consents will be accepted other
than pursuant to such disclosure statement and proxy statement. The advisors
to MRT and the various holders of Secured Notes are negotiating additional
terms of the new debt securities to be received by the Secured Note holders
under the prepackaged plan, as well as the formal documentation necessary to
the restructuring. Details of the agreement in principle will be disclosed in
that formal documentation.

MRT is a self-administered real estate investment trust with a portfolio
of over $309 million of commercial, industrial and other real estate assets. 
MRT has offices in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania and Burbank, California.

TERM SHEET - FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

The following outline is a summary of certain terms and conditions for a
restructuring of the Senior Secured Uncertificated Notes due 1995 (the "Senior
Notes") of Mortgage and Realty Trust ("MRT") and a prepackaged plan of
reorganization for MRT (the "Plan"). It has been prepared solely to facilitate
discussion of a possible transaction and does not create or reflect any
agreement, commitment or obligation on the part of any person and may only be
used for the purpose of negotiating and facilitating settlement discussions. 
This Term Sheet shall be inadmissable in any proceeding relating to the
settlement of claims or contestable matters.

PROPOSED TREATMENTS
- -------------------

A. Senior Notes:

On the Effective Date of the Plan, each holder of MRT's Senior Notes issued
under the Indenture dated July 15, 1992 between MRT and Wilmington Trust
Company (the "Old Senior Notes Indenture") will receive its pro rata share
of the following:

(1) the amount of cash held by MRT in excess of its short-term obligations
following confirmation of the Plan (the "Short-Term Obligations");
provided, however, that such amount shall not be less than $50 
million. The holders of the Senior Notes agree that the amount of the
Short-Term Obligations, which shall not exceed $10 million, shall be
determined by the holders of the Senior Notes, after consultation with
and input from the management of MRT regarding its Short-Term
Obligations, and it is the intent of the holders of the Senior Notes
to allow MRT to retain a sufficient amount of cash to enable MRT to
satisfy its Short-Term Obligations following confirmation of the Plan
and avoid any liquidity shortfalls.

(2) $110 million aggregate principal amount of 11-1/8% senior secured
notes due 2002 (the "New Senior Notes"); and

(3) 97% (or 99.5% if the holders of old equity interest do not vote to
accept the Plan in accordance with section 1126(d) of the Bankruptcy
Code) of the common stock of MRT issued on the Effective Date of the
Plan (the "Common Stock", and collectively with the New Senior Notes,
the "New Securities").

B. Imperial Bank Claim:

The Imperial Bank loan will be restructured in accordance with the New
Imperial Bank Loan Documents (subject to review and approval by the holders
of the Senior Notes).

C. Unsecured Claims

Holders of unsecured claims will receive cash in the allowed amount of
their claims (subject to review of the estimated amount of such claims).

D. Existing Equity Interests

If holders of equity interests vote to accept the Plan in accordance with
section 1126(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, then each holder shall receive its
pro rata share of 3% of the New Common Stock on the Effective Date. If
holders of equity interests do not vote to accept the Plan in accordance
with section 1126(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, they shall receive nothing on
account of their equity interests. In either event, all existing equity
interests will be canceled on the Effective Date of the Plan.
