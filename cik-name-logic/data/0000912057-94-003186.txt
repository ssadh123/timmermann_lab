FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION
FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 1995
FINANCIAL RESULTS

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION REPORTS
86% INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR FIRST QUARTER

MEMPHIS, September 14, 1994 ... Federal Express Corporation today announced that
net income for the quarter ended August 31 was $61.1 million, an 86% increase
over last year's first quarter net income of $32.9 million. Earnings per share
rose to $1.08 from $0.60 per share last year.

Revenues for the quarter were $2,231.1 million, 11% higher than last year's
$2,015.7 million. Operating income increased to $143.0 million from $101.9
million, and pretax income rose to $107.3 million from $60.8 million a year ago.

International operating profit for the first quarter was $22.7 million on
international segment revenues of $596.8 million. In last year's first quarter,
the international segment reported an operating loss of $33.2 million on
revenues of $535.3 million.

<PAGE>

The company's U.S. domestic operating profit was $120.3 million on revenues of
$1,634.3 million, compared to an operating profit of $135.1 million on revenues
of $1,480.4 million in last year's first quarter.

Commenting on the quarter's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Frederick W. Smith said, "This was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-
year improvement in net income. The increased earnings continue to be primarily
due to improved performance in our international segment. International
Priority package volumes have increased more than 20% for the past two quarters.
In addition, revenues for international airfreight increased this quarter almost
18% year-over-year. Looking forward, our systemwide ISO 9001 certification
announced today will further advance FedEx's competitive position overseas."

Chief Financial Officer Alan B. Graf, Jr. said, "We are pleased that our cost
per package in the U.S. domestic segment declined 2.7%, year-over-year.
However, due in large part to the extremely aggressive pricing environment,
revenue per package declined 4.6%. Significant investments are continuing in
order to further reduce our cost per package and these investments are
contributing to the reduction in our current U.S. domestic profit margins."
