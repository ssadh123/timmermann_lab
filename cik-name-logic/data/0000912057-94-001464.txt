PRESS RELEASE

RELEASE DATE: April 25, 1994

CONTACT PERSON: Bernhard M. Koch 610/889-7400

Laurentian Capital Corporation, a life insurance holding company based in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, today reported that it used funds from internal
resources to repay $10 million of debt under its existing US $55 million
Revolving Underwriting Facility which expired today and refinanced the balance.

The Company said it entered into a new five year credit agreement in the amount
of $45 million with a syndicate of four international banks led by National
Bank of Canada. The banks participating are National Bank of Canada, National
Westminster Bank PLC, The Daiwa Bank, Ltd. and Rabobank Nederland. This
transaction will result in a significant reduction in interest expense over
the term of the new credit facility.

Laurentian Capital Corporation (LQ-AMEX) has assets of approximately $976
million and total life insurance in force in excess of $2.8 billion.
Laurentian's primary life insurance subsidiaries are Loyal American Life
Insurance Company, of Mobile, Alabama, and Prairie States Life Insurance Company
