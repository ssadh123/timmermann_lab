generally accepted accounting principles or otherwise, of
any such Debt or other obligation on the balance sheet of
such Person (and 'Incurrence', 'Incurred', 'Incurrable'
and 'Incurring' shall have meanings correlative to the
foregoing); provided, however, that a change in generally

any mortgage or deed of trust, pledge, hypothecation,
assignment, deposit arrangement, security interest, lien,

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

(iii) After the definition of Outstanding:

"'pari passu', when used with respect to the ranking of
any Debt of any Person in relation to other Debt of such
Person, means that each such Debt (a) either (i) is not
subordinated in right of payment to the same Debt of such
Person or (ii) is subordinate in right of payment to the
same Debt of such Person as is the other and is so
subordinate to the same extent and (b) is not subordinate
in right of payment to the other or to any Debt of such
Person as to which the other is not so subordinate."

(iv) After the definition of Predecessor Security:

"'Preferred Stock' of any Person means Capital Stock of
such Person of any class or classes (however designated)
that ranks prior, as to the payment of dividends or as to
the distribution of assets upon any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
such Person, to shares of Capital Stock of any other
class of such Person."

Section 3.02. Section 1009 is renumbered Section 1014 and
amended by replacing the reference to "1009" in the last
sentence thereof with "1014".

Section 3.03. Section 1010 is renumbered Section 1015 and
amended by replacing the reference to "1009" in the first

Section 3.04. Sections 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012 and 1013 are
added, to read in their entirety as follows: 

"Section 1009. Limitation on Debt and Preferred Stock of

of issuance of the Notes after giving effect to the
application of the proceeds of the Notes as described

held by an Issuer or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of an
Issuer; provided, however, that upon either (x) the

Wholly Owned Subsidiary of any Debt so permitted to a
Person other than an Issuer or another Wholly Owned
Subsidiary of an Issuer or (y) the issuance

<PAGE>

(other than directors' qualifying shares), sale, lease,
transfer or other disposition of shares of Capital
Stock (including by consolidation or merger) of such
Wholly Owned Subsidiary to a Person other than an
Issuer or another such Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the
provisions of this clause (iii) of this Section 1009
shall no longer be applicable to such Debt and such
Debt shall be deemed to have been Incurred at the time
of such transfer or other disposition; 

(iv) Debt Incurred or Preferred Stock issued by a
Person prior to the time (A) such Person became a
Subsidiary of an Issuer, (B) such Person merges into or
consolidates with a Subsidiary of an Issuer or (C)
another Subsidiary of an Issuer merges into or

which such Person becomes a Subsidiary of an Issuer),
which Debt or Preferred Stock was not Incurred or
issued in anticipation of such transaction and was

(v) Debt secured by a Lien on real or personal
property which Debt (a) constitutes all or a part of
the purchase price of such property or (b) is Incurred
prior to, at the time of or within 270 days after the
acquisition of such property for the purpose of
financing all or any part of the purchase price
thereof; provided, however, the Debt so secured does
not exceed the purchase price of such property and such
Lien does not extend to or cover any property other
than such item of property and any improvements on such
item; 

(vi) Debt or Preferred Stock which is exchanged for,
or the proceeds of which are used to refinance or
refund, any Debt or Preferred Stock permitted to be
outstanding pursuant to clauses (iv) and (v) of this
Section 1009 (or any extension or renewal thereof), in
an aggregate principal amount, in the case of Debt, or
liquidation preference, in the case of Preferred Stock,
not to exceed the principal amount or liquidation
preference of the Debt or Preferred Stock,
respectively, so exchanged, refinanced or refunded plus
the amount of any premium required to be paid in
connection with such refinancing pursuant to the terms
of the Debt or Preferred Stock so exchanged, refinanced
or refunded or the amount of any premium reasonably
determined by the Issuers as necessary to accomplish
such refinancing by means of a tender offer or
privately negotiated repurchase, plus the amount of
expenses of the Issuers and the Subsidiary incurred in
connection with such refinancing and provided such
exchanging, refinancing or refunding Debt or Preferred
Stock by its terms, or by the terms of any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which such Debt or Preferred
Stock is issued, (x) does not provide for payments of
principal or liquidation value at the stated maturity
of such Debt or Preferred Stock or by way of a sinking
fund applicable to such Debt or Preferred Stock or by
way of any mandatory redemption, defeasance, retirement
or repurchase of such Debt or Preferred Stock by an
Issuer or any Subsidiary of an Issuer (including any
redemption, retirement or repurchase which is
contingent 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

upon events or circumstances, but excluding any
retirement required by virtue of acceleration of such
Debt upon an event of default thereunder), in each case
prior to the stated maturity of the Debt or Preferred
Stock being refinanced or refunded and (y) does not
permit redemption or other retirement (including
pursuant to an offer to purchase made by an Issuer or a
Subsidiary of an Issuer) of such Debt or Preferred
Stock at the option of the holder thereof prior to the
stated maturity of the Debt or Preferred Stock being
refinanced or refunded, other than a redemption or
other retirement at the option of the holder of such
Debt or Preferred Stock (including pursuant to an offer
to purchase made by an Issuer or a Subsidiary of an
Issuer) which is conditioned upon the change of control
of the Issuers pursuant to provisions substantially
similar to those contained in Section 1008, and
provided, further, that (a) such exchanging,
refinancing or refunding debt shall be Incurred only by
the Subsidiary that is the obligor with respect to the
Debt or Preferred Stock being exchanged, refinanced or
refunded, (b) in the case of any exchange, refinancing
or refunding of Preferred Stock, such Preferred Stock
is exchanged, refinanced or refunded with Preferred
Stock and (c) any exchange, refinancing or refunding of
Debt permitted to be outstanding pursuant to clause (v)
of this Section 1009 shall consist of Debt secured by a
Lien on the property securing the Debt being exchanged,
refinanced or refunded, and no other property; 

(vii) Debt Incurred by any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries
substantially all of the assets and operations of which
are outside the United States (each, a "Foreign
Subsidiary"), the proceeds of which are used to
finance, or refinance from a third party, the working
capital or capital expenditures of such Foreign
Subsidiary; and

(viii) Debt or Preferred Stock not otherwise permitted
pursuant to clauses (i) through (vii) of this Section
1009 which, together with any other Debt or Preferred
Stock outstanding pursuant to this clause (viii) of
this Section 1009, is in an aggregate amount not in
excess of $5,000,000 at any time outstanding."

"Section 1010. Limitations Concerning Distributions by
and Transfers from Subsidiaries.

Each of the Issuers shall not, and shall not permit
any Subsidiary to, suffer to exist any consensual
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Subsidiary of an Issuer (other than, in the case of
Scotts, OMS) 

(i) to pay directly or indirectly dividends or make
any other distributions in respect of its Capital Stock
or pay any Debt or other obligation owed to an Issuer
or any other Subsidiary; 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

(ii) to make loans or advances to an Issuer or any
other Subsidiary; or 

(iii) to transfer any of its property or assets to an
Issuer or any other Subsidiary. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers may, and
may permit any Subsidiary to, suffer to exist any such
encumbrance or restriction;

(a) pursuant to any agreement in effect on the date
of the Indenture (including the Bank Agreement) as
described in Schedule B hereto, 

(b) pursuant to an agreement relating to any Debt
Incurred by such Subsidiary prior to the date on which
such Subsidiary was acquired by an Issuer and
outstanding on such date and not Incurred in
anticipation of becoming a Subsidiary, 

(c) pursuant to an agreement effecting a renewal,
refunding or extension of Debt Incurred pursuant to an
agreement referred to in clause (b) above; provided,
however, that the provisions contained in such renewal,
refunding or extension agreement relating to such
encumbrance or restriction are no more restrictive in
any material respect than the provisions contained in
the agreement the subject thereof, as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of Scotts and
evidenced by a Board Resolution of Scotts, or 

(d) pursuant to customary encumbrances in any
agreement relating to any Debt Incurred by a Foreign
Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of clause (vii)
of Section 1009."

"Section 1011. Limitation on Liens Securing Pari Passu or
Subordinated Debt.

Each of the Issuers shall not, and shall not permit
any Subsidiary of an Issuer to, Incur or suffer to exist
any Lien on or with respect to any property or assets now
owned or hereafter acquired to secure any Debt which is
pari passu or subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes without making, or causing such Subsidiary to make,
effective provision for securing the Notes (x) equally
and ratably with such Debt as to such property for so
long as such Debt will be so secured or (y) in the event
such Debt is Debt of an Issuer which is subordinate in
right of payment to the Notes, prior to such Debt as to
such property for so long as such Debt will be so
secured. 

The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to: (i)
Liens securing only the Notes; and (ii) Liens in favor of
an Issuer."

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

"Section 1012. Transactions with Affiliates and Related
Persons.

Each of the Issuers shall not, and shall not permit
any Subsidiary of an Issuer to, enter into any
transaction (or series of related transactions) with an
Affiliate or Related Person of an Issuer (other than an
Issuer or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of an Issuer),
including any Investment, either directly or indirectly,
unless such transaction is on terms no less favorable to
such Issuer or such Subsidiary than those that could be
obtained in a comparable arm's length transaction with an
entity that is not an Affiliate or Related Person and is

The Scotts Company, a corporation duly organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein
called "Scotts", which term includes any successor Person
under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), and The O.M.
Scott & Sons Company, a corporation duly organized and
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein
called "OMS", which term includes any successor Person under
the Indenture hereinafter referred to), as joint and several
obligors (collectively, herein called the "Issuers" ), for
value received, hereby promise to pay to Cede & Co., or regis-
tered assigns, the principal sum of
..................................... Dollars on August 1,
2004, and to pay interest thereon from July 19, 1994, or from
the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on February 1
and August 1 in each year, commencing February 1, 1995, at the
rate of 9 7/8% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid
or made available for payment, provided that any principal and
premium, and any such instalment of interest, which is overdue
shall bear interest at the rate of 10 7/8% per annum (to the
extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally
enforceable), from the dates such amounts are due until they
are paid or made available for payment, and such interest
shall be payable on demand. The interest so payable, and
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the

paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable
to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be
paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business
on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be
given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than
10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any
time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the
requirements of any securities exchange on which the
Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice
as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully
provided in said Indenture. 

Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any
such interest on this Security will be made at the office or
agency of the Issuers in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of
New York, the State of New York maintained for such purpose or
at any other office or agency maintained by the Issuers for
such purpose, in such coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment
of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the
option of the Issuers payment of interest may be made by check
mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such
address shall appear in the Security Register.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this
Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further
provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if
set forth at this place.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by
manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any
benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Issuers has caused this
instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of
securities of the Issuers (herein called the "Securities"),
issued and to be issued in one or more series under an
Indenture, dated as of June 1, 1994, as supplemented by the
First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 12, 1994 (as so
supplemented, herein called the "Indenture", which term shall
have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between
the Issuers and Chemical Bank, as Trustee (herein called the
"Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the
Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for
a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights,
duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuers, the Trustee
and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which
the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and
delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on
the face hereof.

The Securities of this series are subject to redemption
upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail,
at any time on or after August 1, 1999 and prior to maturity,
as a whole or in part in amounts of $1,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000, at the election of the Issuers, at the
following Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the
principal amount): If redeemed during the 12-month period
beginning August 1 of the years indicated,

<S> <C>

1999 104.9375%

</TABLE>

and thereafter at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount,
together in the case of any such redemption with accrued interest to the
Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or
prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close
of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof,
all as provided in the Indenture.

In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new
Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed
portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
cancellation hereof.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuers will be
required to make an Offer to Purchase all outstanding Securities at a
purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued
interest to the date of purchase.

The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided
in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Debt, and this Security is issued subject to
the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this
Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take
such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordina-
tion so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any
and all such purposes.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the
entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and
Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon
compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may
be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Issuers and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to
be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Issuers and the Trustee
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Securities at the time Outstanding of each 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting
the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities
of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all
Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Issuers with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture
and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the
registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof,
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any
proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a
receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder
shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing
Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders
of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series
at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to
institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and
offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have
received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities
of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such
request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60
days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The
foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this
Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any
premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed
herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuers,
which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any
premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in
the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at
the office or agency of the Issuers in any place where the principal of and
any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Issuers and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations
and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the
designated transferee or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple
thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer,
the Issuers, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuers or the Trustee may
treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and
neither the Issuers, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
