Item 5. OTHER EVENTS

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a written order 
on May 24, 1994, in which it adopted, with some modifications and 
clarifications, the Final Recommended Decision (FRD) proposed last October 
by the Federal-State Alaska Joint Board. (See "Part I, Item 1, Business -
Telecommunications Operations - Alaska Market Restructuring" on page 7 of the 
Pacific Telecom, Inc. (Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1993.) The modifications suggested by various interested 
parties and supported, in part, by Alascom, Inc. (Alascom), clarified AT&T
Communications, Inc.'s (AT&T) obligation to provide interstate Message Toll 
Service/Wide Area Telephone Service (MTS/WATS) throughout all of Alaska and 
to utilize the Bush service facilities of Alascom in meeting that obligation. 
The FCC's written order also affirms Alascom's obligation to provide 
interstate common carrier services on a non-discriminatory basis to all 
interstate interexchange carriers (IXCs), under tariffs reflecting separate 
rate schedules for locations subject to facilities competition (non-Bush) and 
for locations where Alascom has a facilities monopoly (Bush). The costs of
service in each of these categories would be defined pursuant to a cost 
allocation plan developed by Alascom and approved by the FCC. 

Based upon the FRD, the FCC's order incorporated the following points:

The Joint Services Agreement between AT&T and Alascom would continue 
in effect until January 1, 1996; 

AT&T would make Accelerated Cost Recovery (ACR) payments to Alascom, 
each in the amount of $75 million, on July 1, 1994 and December 31, 
1995; 

In the event Alascom was unable to provide a successor spacecraft to 
Aurora II, the FCC would retain authority to order AT&T or another 
carrier to provide such a facility; 

Alascom would be required to file its cost allocation plan within 90 
days of this order and to file its tariffs and cost support 
information for common carrier services it would provide to AT&T and 
other carriers 120 days before the scheduled effective date for the 
tariffs of January 1, 1996, using the authorized interstate rate of 
return applicable to local exchange carriers; and 

The amount of interstate services that AT&T would be required to
purchase from Alascom during the transition period after January 1, 
1996, would be adjusted by revenues, if any, associated with new 
services purchased by other interexchange carriers and by the 
proportion of the interstate MTS/WATS network use by Alascom. 

The FCC also ordered AT&T and Alascom to request a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service and the State of Alaska regarding the taxability of 
the ACR payments. Should the payments be deemed nontaxable by those 
authorities, the amount of the ACR would be reduced by the tax that otherwise 
would have been payable by Alascom. 

The Company believes the modifications made by the FCC improve upon 
the FRD from a public interest perspective. However, the Company is 
analyzing the impact of the order on its operations and is considering 
whether to pursue further regulatory or judicial action. The Company intends
to act in a manner that will best serve its customers in Alaska and its
shareholders.
