ICF KAISER INTERNATIONAL ANNOUNCES FOURTH-QUARTER AND YEAR-END FINANCIAL
RESULTS

FAIRFAX, VA, Apr. 22, 1994 -- ICF Kaiser International, Inc. (NYSE: ICF)
announced today financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year
ended February 28, 1994. For the quarter, gross revenue was $197.6 million,
an increase of 30.9 percent over the prior year's fourth-quarter revenue
of $150.9 million. Service revenue for the period also increased, up 8.4
percent to $100.9 million versus last year's fourth-quarter service
revenue of $93.1 million. Higher revenue for the quarter, primarily due to
a large expansion of the company's contract to provide services at the
U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford, Washington, site, was offset
partially by a significant revenue decline in other businesses.

Year over year, the company's gross revenue declined slightly, down 4.0
percent to $651.7 million. Service revenue for the 12 months was down 2.3
percent to $382.7 million. Service revenue reflects work performed directly
by the company, whereas gross revenue includes subcontracted work and the
cost of direct materials.

Full-year financial results were influenced heavily by weak operating
performance in the company's fourth quarter. Through the first nine months
of the year, ICF Kaiser had operating and net income of $8.2 million and
$2.0 million, respectively; however, in the fourth quarter there was a sharp
decline in the company's operating performance that resulted in a
significant fourth-quarter operating loss. In the quarter, ICF Kaiser
experienced an unanticipated sharp decline in volume that was not
proportionately matched with immediate cost reductions.

Responding to the weak demand, in the fourth quarter the company expanded
and accelerated a reorganization of its operations and cost cutting through
staff reductions, office consolidations, significant lease renegotiations,
restructuring certain international operations, and other actions. These
actions are expected to save in excess of $8.0 million of annual operating
expenses in the future. Including one-time charges associated with these
actions ($8.2 million), the company reported an operating loss for the
quarter of $13.5 million, as compared to operating income of $5.2 million in
the comparable period last year. For the year, ICF Kaiser reported an
operating loss of $5.2 million versus operating income of $22.7 million for
the prior year. Excluding the unusual charges, ICF Kaiser generated $3.5
million of operating income for the year.

"Reduced direct labor volume, particularly on industrial and infrastructure
projects; weather-related delays; and losses related to a business that was
sold had a severe impact on profitability in the fourth quarter. Because we
expect industrial and infrastructure market conditions to remain highly
competitive over the next few quarters, we are taking the actions needed to
size our operations to match current market demand," said James O. Edwards,
Chairman and CEO of ICF Kaiser.

"In addition to reducing operating costs," he added, "during the past year
we assembled a new senior management team and strengthened the company's
financial structure through our recent refinancing."

In January 1994, ICF Kaiser successfully refinanced a majority of its
balance sheet capitalization through the sale of $125 million of Senior
Subordinated Notes and warrants. The refinancing resulted in two
extraordinary charges in the fourth quarter: a $6.0 million extraordinary
item for the early prepayment of previously outstanding debt, and a $1.9
million charge to retained earnings associated with the repurchase of the
company's Series 2C Senior Preferred Stock and warrants. These charges
combined to reduce earnings per share for the year by $0.38.

Inclusive of these charges, ICF Kaiser reported a net loss for the quarter
of $20.5 million, with a net loss available to common shareholders of $23.4
million, or $1.12 loss per share. Net income for the prior year's fourth
quarter was $1.5 million, with net income available of $0.2 million, or
$0.01 per share. For the current year, ICF Kaiser reported a net loss of
$18.5 million, with a net loss available to common shareholders of $25.3
million, or $1.21 loss per share. For the prior year, the company reported
net income of $8.6 million, with net income available to common shareholders
of $3.3 million, or $0.16 per share.

According to Edwards, "ICF Kaiser's fourth-quarter operating results were
unacceptable. We have cut costs to match existing market demand, and we
will continue to do so as needed. Longer term, though, the key is not only
cutting costs but growing revenue. To do that, we are focusing on winning
larger projects that generate greater labor volume, and on entering new
markets for our existing services."

ICF Kaiser's backlog of signed contracts at year-end was $1.6 billion.
