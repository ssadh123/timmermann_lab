Item 5. Other Events
- ---------------------

Filed herewith is the Preliminary Unaudited Earnings Summary, as contained
in a press release dated April 18, 1994, for Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML &
Co.") for the three month period ended April 1, 1994, which will be superseded
by ML & Co.'s Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 1994. The
results of operations set forth herein for the three month period ended April 1,
1994 are unaudited. All adjustments that are in the opinion of management
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the period
presented have been included. These adjustments consist of normal recurring
accruals. The nature of ML & Co.'s business is such that the results for any
interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. As
previously reported, ML & Co. adopted effective as of the first quarter of 1993,
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits) and restated first quarter 1993 financial statements to
reflect the $35.4 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of applicable income
taxes. In addition, the results for the first quarter of 1993 include a non-
recurring charge of $103 million related to ML & Co.'s decision not to occupy
certain space at its World Financial Center headquarters facility.
