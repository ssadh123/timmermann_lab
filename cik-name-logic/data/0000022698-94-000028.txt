COMSAT REPORTS 12 PERCENT INCREASE IN REVENUES,
EARNINGS FOR 3RD QUARTER UP 10 PERCENT

BETHESDA, Md. -- COMSAT Corporation today reported
third quarter 1994 revenues of $200.8 million, or 12 percent
over results for the same period a year earlier. Earnings
for third quarter were 45 cents per share, up 10 percent 
over 1993 third quarter results.

"We're pleased with our results in the third quarter,
particularly the return of growth in the Mobile
Communications segment," said Bruce L. Crockett, president
and CEO of COMSAT Corporation. "However, because of the
softness in the first half of the year, we will not achieve
our goal of 10 percent earnings growth for the year."

In the third quarter, COMSAT Mobile Communications
revenues grew to $51.3 million from $47.3 million a year
earlier as the number of digital terminals in the
marketplace grew to more than 3,000. With more terminals in
operation and conflicts in Haiti and Rwanda, traffic
increased 16 percent. Operating income increased 11 percent
to $13.9 million, from $12.6 million a year earlier, as a
result of the growth in traffic.

In the Entertainment segment, which includes COMSAT
Video Enterprises and the Denver Nuggets, revenues grew 24
percent to $33.0 million in the third quarter compared to
$26.6 million a year ago. Operating income

Page 5 of 12
<PAGE>

increased 20 percent to $2.9 million, from $2.4 million a
year earlier. The total number of installed and backlog
hotel rooms for the On Command Video service reached 362,000
in the third quarter, compared to 168,000 for the same
period a year ago.

"The third quarter marks COMSAT's climb to the market-
leading position for supplying on-demand entertainment
services to hotels in the U.S.," said Crockett. "And we are
now in the process of taking the on-demand service
international."

Revenues in the International Communications segment,
which includes COMSAT World Systems and COMSAT International 
Ventures, were $67.2 million, compared to $61.7 million a
year ago -- as lower prices have led to an increase in
demand. Operating income was $24.0 million, compared to
$22.5 million a year ago.

In the Technology Services segment, which includes
COMSAT RSI and COMSAT Laboratories, revenues in the third
quarter increased 18 percent to $53.7 million, compared to
$45.5 million for the same period a year earlier. Operating
income fell from $3.2 million a year earlier to $2.0 million
due to additional transaction costs from the Radiation
Systems acquisition in the second quarter this year and
business-interruption insurance proceeds that were part of
the third quarter results last year.

"We've used this quarter to consolidate and solidify
our market strategies and we expect to see additional
bookings for COMSAT RSI in the near future," said Crockett.

In other business, the Board of Directors declared a
regular quarterly dividend of 19.5 cents, payable December
12, 1994, to shareholders of record November 11, 1994. This
is the 97th consecutive quarterly dividend declared by the
corporation.

COMSAT Corporation (NYSE: CQ) is a global 
provider of communications and entertainment products and
services.

COMSAT ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR INVESTMENTS, START-UPS IN
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS, ENTERTAINMENT

BETHESDA, Md. -- COMSAT Corporation (NYSE: CQ) today
outlined plans for growing its international communications
products and services business, global wireless offerings
and entertainment segment.

"We are determined to take advantage of the growth
opportunities that are before us -- both in our core
international communications business and in sports and
entertainment," said COMSAT President and CEO Bruce L.
Crockett. "Our ambitious growth plan will affect
profitability in the short term, but it is designed to
deliver long-term growth and dramatically increase
shareholder value."

Crockett said the company's aggressive strategy to
pursue additional investments and long-term growth
opportunities will result in earnings growth of less than 10
percent next year. "Our focus is growing long-term
shareholder value as we embark on a program of reinvestment
and new business start-ups," he said.

COMSAT will set out its strategic plan at an analysts
conference tomorrow (November 1, 1994) at the company's
corporate headquarters. Strategic plans that will be
announced include:

Plans to invest up to $200 million in international
ventures in 1995, concentrating on Asia and Europe, and
expanding in Latin America.

Investing $50 million in a laptop-size, mini-M mobile
service to fuel continued growth in mobile communications --
and provide a bridge from the current briefcase-size digital
terminal to the global handheld market at the end of the
century.

Additional investment in the proposed Inmarsat-P
global handheld service -- possibly up to 15 percent of the 
total project cost -- depending on the commitment of other
key investors, the overall strategic plan for the $1.5
billion business and the timing of necessary U.S. government
approvals for COMSAT's participation.

"We're also leveraging our successes on the
entertainment side of the business through the acquisition
of Beacon Communications and a proposed new sports and
entertainment complex in Denver," said Crockett. 

COMSAT last week announced an agreement to purchase
Beacon, a Los Angeles-based film and television production
company. The sports and entertainment complex will include
a new 19,000-seat arena for the NBA Denver Nuggets and
possibly a future professional hockey franchise.

Crockett also said COMSAT has many undervalued assets -
- like its investment share of INTELSAT and Inmarsat,
communications licenses for international ventures, the
Denver Nuggets franchise and real estate holdings -- that
will provide the building blocks for additional future
growth.

COMSAT Corporation is a global provider of
communications and entertainment products and services.
