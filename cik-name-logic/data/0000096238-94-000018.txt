SIDE LETTER AGREEMENT (NO. 1) SUPPLEMENTING THE RESTRUCTURE
AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SENIOR BANK DEBT OF
TALLEY INDUSTRIES, INC.

Gentlemen:

This letter memorializes and supplements certain understandings
relevant to:

(i) that certain Loan Restructure Agreement, dated as of April 15,
1992 (the "Restructure Agreement"), made by and among Talley Industries,
Inc. ("Talley") and certain Subsidiaries of Talley which are or may
become signatories thereto; Continental Bank N.A., Individually and as
Agent for Banca di Roma, San Francisco Branch; Chemical Bank, National
Westminster Bank USA, RBC Finance, B.V. (collectively, the "Class Two
Creditors"); First Interstate Bank of Arizona, N.A., Individually and as
Agent for United States National Bank of Oregon, CIBC, Inc., NBD Bank,
N.A., Harris Trust and Savings Bank, and Seattle-First National Bank
(collectively, the "Class Three Creditors"); and

(ii) that certain Collateral Trust Agreement, dated as of April 15,
1992 (the "Collateral Trust Agreement"), made by and among The Bank of
New York as Collateral Trustee; Talley and certain Subsidiaries of Talley
which are or may become signatories thereto; the Class Two Creditors; the
Class Three Creditors; Kemper Investors Life Insurance Company; Kemper
High Income Trust; Federal Kemper Life Assurance Company; Fidelity Life
Association; and Household Commercial Financial Services, Inc., as
holders of Series A and Series B Subordinated Notes; and Resolution Trust
Corporation, as Receiver of Western Savings and Loan Association, F.A. 
All capitalized terms not specifically defined in this letter shall have
the meanings given to them in the Restructure Agreement.

A. Talley agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall effect any Disposition of any of its now owned or hereafter
acquired assets (other than inventory disposed of in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practices of the seller, or assets no
longer used or useful in the conduct of its business), except such
Dispositions which satisfy any and all applicable requirements stated
herein and in the Restructure Agreement, and which shall include the
express good faith determination of Talley's Board of Directors (or
Executive Committee thereof) in the case of a transaction involving a
sale price in excess of $2.0 million, or upon an express good faith
determination by Talley's management in the case of a lesser selling
price, that the selling price and terms are prudent, fair and reasonable.

B. To facilitate efforts to sell real property assets that will
be subject to the Collateral Trust Agreement, the Boards of Directors of
Talley and each Guarantor granting the Collateral Trustee a lien on Real
Property Collateral have established, in good faith, for certain assets
included within the Real Property Collateral, a "Realty Release Price" 

2
<PAGE>

and a "Realty Strike Price" as set forth in Schedule A hereto. Talley
hereby certifies that Realty Release Prices are not less than 
of their respective book values as of December 1, 1991,
and that the Realty Strike Prices are not more than Realty Release Prices
divided by . Realty Release Prices and Realty Strike Prices may be
revised from time to time hereafter with the approval of the Required
Parties (as identified in the Collateral Trust Agreement). Adjustments
in Realty Strike Prices shall be required for specific write downs or
reserves approved by Talley's external auditors, but no such adjustments
shall be allowed with respect to Realty Release Prices.

C. Talley (or the applicable Guarantor) shall be entitled to have
the lien held by the Collateral Trustee against a particular asset
(except the Royalty Collateral) released upon the sale of that asset
satisfying each of the conditions set forth herein and in the Restructure
Agreement, including any required prepayment of the Class Two and Three
Debts provided therein.

D. Talley has engaged The Performance Group (an "Investment
Banker") to actively market the sale of Minelco and Waters, and Talley
itself is actively marketing the other Guarantors ( other than Realty,
TRFIC, TRHC, TRIG and New California) to logical "Strategic buyers" and
other potential buyers. In the event the Agents in their sole discretion
determine that it is advisable for Talley to engage an investment banking
firm to market such other Guarantors, then Talley will do so upon the
request of the Agents and will promptly engage an investment banking firm
reasonably acceptable to the Agents (which will also be deemed to be an
"Investment Banker"), but subject to an appropriate exception for any
potential sale already under negotiation/consideration by Talley at the
time.

E. Talley hereby agrees that it will cause such Investment
Bankers as are engaged to regularly (and no less frequently than
quarterly) consult with Talley and Agents for the Class Two and Three
Creditors to endeavor to sell the Guarantors (other than Realty, TRFIC,
TRHC, TRIG and New California) at prices not less than the greater of
either their respective book values (as of the then most recent month
end) or their respective average annual EBITDA (as herein defined)--
(multiplied by 5) for the three (3) years immediately preceding the date
of determination.

F. Talley and Guarantors covenant that they shall use best
reasonable and good faith efforts to sell or otherwise dispose of the
Asset, Stock, Real Property, and Real Estate Stock Collateral, upon fair
and reasonable terms in arms-length transactions.

FINAL
<PAGE>

G. Consistent with the Business Plan and Talley's announced
intention to sell assets, including those comprising Real Property, Asset
and Stock Collateral at the prices articulated herein, Talley and the 

Guarantors agree not to refuse any bona fide offer to purchase any
portion of the Real Property, Asset, Real Estate Stock or Stock
Collateral, if such offer is for cash or for ninety percent (90%) cash
and terms and:

(i) in the case of Real Property Collateral, such offer is
equal to or greater than the Realty Strike Price
applicable to such Collateral; or

(ii) in the case of Porcelain, Dimetrics, Minelco and Waters,
and their respective Subsidiaries, divisions and
business units such offer is equal to or greater than
average annual EBITDA (multiplied by 5) for the three
(3) year period immediately preceding the date of
determination, or book value (as of the then most recent
month end), whichever is greater.

Talley's (or the applicable Guarantor's) obligation to accept an offer
within the above stated parameters may be deferred, for a period not to
exceed ten (10) Business Days, in order to attempt to negotiate a better
offer, provided the Agents for the Class Two and Three Creditors are
persuaded, in their reasonable judgment, that a better offer may be
negotiated with the potential buyer, and that in all events a sale or
other Disposition to such buyer, on terms no less favorable than the
original offer, will be consummated by a date that is not later than the
closing date specified in the original offer plus the number of days that
acceptance of the original offer was allowed to be deferred.

H. Talley (or the applicable Guarantor) shall have the right to
elect not to accept an offer coming within the parameters stated in
paragraph G. In order to exercise this right Talley and the applicable
Guarantor agree to pay in cash to the Agents for the benefit of their
respective Creditor Classes, ratably in accordance with the Pro Rate
Percentages, on the first day of the next January, April, July or
October, whichever occurs first, following such election, from sources
other than assets comprising Collateral for the Class Two and Three Debt,
an amount equal to the amount which the Class Two and Three Creditors
would have received had Talley or the applicable Guarantor accepted such
offer and consummated such sale or other Disposition. The payment
received by the Class Two and Three Creditors shall be treated the same
as if it represented the Net Proceeds of a sale or other Disposition of
the Collateral with respect to which the offer was made. If such payment
effectively represents Net Proceeds from Dispositions, Collections or 

FINAL
<PAGE>
4

Distributions on account of Real Property Collateral or Real Estate Stock
Collateral, such payment shall be treated as such, and be subject to and
governed by Sections 3.5 through 3.6 of the Restructure Agreement. 
Talley shall be entitled to direct the application of such payment in
prepayment of quarterly installments due the Class Two and Three
Creditors as provided in Section 3 of the Restructure Agreement. If an
election is made no to accept such an offer, the property which would
have been the subject of such sale or other Disposition shall continue
to be subject to the provisions of the Restructure Agreement and the
Collateral Trust Agreement unless the amount paid to Class Two and Three
Creditors in cash is equal to what would have been the entire "Net
Proceeds" of such sale or other Disposition.

I. Talley agrees that it shall not, without the consent of the
Agents and any other creditor whose consent is required, sell or
otherwise effect any Disposition of,

(A) the following Subsidiaries or their respective
Subsidiaries (or assets or stock of each such
Subsidiary) for less than the lower of the going concern
value as reflected in a then current appraisal of a
qualified appraiser (if any such appraisal has been
obtained by Talley) or the following prices:

Porcelain: 75% of Tangible Book Value (as hereafter
defined) as of the then most recent month
end;
Dimetrics: 90% of Tangible Book Value as of the then
most recent month end;
Minelco: 90% of Tangible Book Value as of the then
most recent month end;
Waters: 90% of Tangible Book Value as of the then
most recent month end;

(B) Any Real Property Collateral for which a Realty Release
Price has been established, for an amount less than the
Realty Release Price for such asset;

(C) Any Real Property Note Collateral for an amount less
than 80% of the aggregate unpaid amount outstanding on
such note.

J. Talley agrees that, without the consent of the Agents and any
other creditor whose consent is required:

(i) No portion of the selling price of Real Property
Collateral (other than Real Property Note Collateral) 

FINAL
<PAGE>
5

may be deferred unless: (a) at least twenty percent
(20%) of such price is received in cash at the time of
the closing of the transaction; (b) the deferred
portion of such price is not deferred for more than
five years; (c) the deferred portion of such price is
secured, at a minimum, by a first lien on the property
sold or otherwise disposed of, with portions of the
property being subject to release upon payment of a sum
corresponding to at least one hundred ten percent
(110.0%) of the value of the property to be released;
and, (d) all of Talley's or the applicable Guarantor's
interest in the instrument, note or other document
evidencing the deferred portion of such price is
pledged to the Collateral Trustee.

(ii) No portion of the selling price (or price of any other
Disposition) of any Real Property Note Collateral may
be deferred, and 100% of such price must be received in
cash at the time of the closing of the transaction.

(iii) No portion of the selling price (or price of any other
Disposition) of a Guarantor or any of their respective
assets (other than inventory sold in the ordinary
course of business of the seller, consistent with past
practices) may be deferred unless: (a) at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the price is received in
cash at the time of the closing of the transaction: (b)
the deferred portion of such price is not deferred more
than six years; (c) the instrument, note or other
document evidencing the deferred portion of such price
provides for minimum annual payments equal to the
deferred balance divided by the number of years
deferred; and, (d) all of Talley's or the applicable
Guarantor's interest in such instrument, note or other
document is pledged to the Collateral Trustee.

(iv) No portion of the selling price (or price of any other
Disposition) of assets (other than inventory sold in
the ordinary course of business of the seller,
consistent with past practices) which do not constitute
Collateral for the Class Two and Three Debts may be
deferred unless: (a) at least fifty percent (50%) is
received in cash at the time of the closing of the
transaction: (b) the deferred portion of such price is 

FINAL

<PAGE>
6

not deferred for more than six years; and, (c) the
instrument, note or other document evidencing the
deferred obligation provides for minimum annual
principal payments equal to the deferred balance
divided by the number of years deferred.

(v) All Dispositions of assets (other than inventory sold
in the ordinary course of business of the seller,
consistent with past practices) involving a deferred
payment of the selling price (or price of any other
Disposition) shall be evidenced by a promissory note:
(a) bearing interest at the prevailing market rates for
such notes: (b) payable at least annually; and (c)
which require interest payable at least semiannually.

(vi) Neither Talley nor its Subsidiaries shall amend,
modify, extend, renew or otherwise alter the terms of
any Non-Cash Proceeds of a Disposition except within
the parameters for the same (if any) permitted under
the Restructure Documents.

(vii) If a Disposition not in the ordinary course of business
of the seller/transferor involves an item of Collateral
(other than Real Property Collateral for which
Realty Release Prices have been agreed and other than
inconsequential Collateral), and such Disposition
involves the deferred payment of the selling price,
Talley's Treasurer or Controller shall certify before
such Disposition is consummated that the consideration
to be received by Talley (or applicable Subsidiary) is
not less than the amount required by this letter.

K. Talley agrees that no increases above levels of compensation
existing as of March 1, 1992, and no additional forms of compensation
will be paid to any member of its corporate management identified below
(including their successors), except that:

(i) With respect to members of corporate management other
than Talley's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and
its President and Chief Operating Officer (viz. Messrs.
Corey, Mullen, May and Dickerson), provided no Default
or Potential Default then exists, and provided that as
the end of the most recent quarter preceding the date 

FINAL
<PAGE>

the additional payment is to be made or the effective
date of any such salary increase, as applicable, the
sum of Talley's consolidated "Cash and Cash
Equivalents" plus the aggregate prepayments of the
Class Two and Three Debt made after the Closing Date is
equal to or greater than the amount of "Cash and
Marketable Securities" projected in the Business Plan
as of the same most recent quarter end (each such term
in quotation marks to be calculated on a basis
consistent with the Business Plan), such increases or
additional payments shall be permitted:

(a) in calendar year 1992 (including the period prior
to the date hereof), so long as the aggregate
amount of such payments or increases does not
exceed $50,000;

(b) in calendar year 1993, so long as the aggregate
amount of such increases and additional payments do
not exceed the difference between $100,000 and the
amount of such additional payments and increases
made in 1992; and

(c) in calendar year 1994, so long as the aggregate
amount of such increases and additional payments do
not exceed the difference between $150,000 and the
aggregate amount of such additional payments and
increases made in 1992 and 1993.

(ii) With respect to Talley's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, and its President and Chief Operating Officer,
such increases or additional payments shall be
permitted in calendar year 1993 and/or 1994 commencing
in 1993, provided no Default or Potential Default then
exists:

(a) only if on the date such increases become effective
or additional payments are to be paid, all
prepayments have been made that are required as of
such date by the Notes to be made to avoid any Note
Rate Adjustments;

(b) only if, as to an increase or additional payment to
be made in calendar year 1993, there is prepaid as
of ninety-five days prior to the date such increase
or additional payment is made $2.5 million of the
1993 installments shown on Schedule 1 to the 
Restructure Agreement; and

<PAGE>
8

(c) only if, as to an increase or additional payment to
be made in calendar year 1994, there is prepaid as
of ninety-five days prior to the date such increase
or additional payment is made $5 million of the
1994 installments shown on Schedule 1 to the
Restructure Agreement.

(iii) Such other increases or additional payments in the form
of bonus and incentive compensation for corporate management (including
Talley's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Operating Officer) shall
be permitted if either:

(a) payable solely in capital stock of Talley (or
options or rights therefor), and provided it has no
cash effect on Talley's financial position (other
than a tax deduction for compensation); or

(b) payable following payment in full of the Class Two
and Three Creditors.

L. It is agreed that a refinancing of Debt of Technology owning
pursuant to the Class One Agreements shall be permissible if, in the case
of a refinancing with anyone other than any one or more of the Class One
Creditors or any of their affiliates or any party to the Restructure
Documents, either such refinancing is on terms outlined in the
Intercreditor Agreement that are then applicable, or such refinancing is
on such other terms and within such parameters as are reasonably
acceptable to the Agents (which acceptance will not be withheld if the
position of the Class Two and Three Creditors is not materially less
advantageous after giving effect to such refinancing), including the
continuation of the lien on the Royalty Collateral in favor of the
Collateral Trustee for the benefit of, inter alia, the Class Two and
Three Creditors; provided that in each case any Net Loan Proceeds
remaining after the Class one Debt has been "paid in full" (as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) are paid to the Agents for the benefit
of the Class Two and Three Creditors in accordance with the Pro Rate
Percentages.

M. The term "Tangible Book Value" as used in this Side Letter
Agreement means shareholders equity as determined in accordance with
GAAP, adjusted to eliminate intangible assets.

N. The term "EBITDA" as used in this Side Letter Agreement with

Income"), plus

interest expense attributable to capital leases and any interest expense 
that has been capitalized for any purpose) that was deducted for such
period in determining Net Income, plus

federal, state, local, and foreign income taxes of such Guarantor and its
respective Subsidiaries as the case may be, for such period in
determining Net Income, plus

depreciation and amortization expenses of such Guarantor and its
