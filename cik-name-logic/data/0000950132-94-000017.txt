B&LE Litigation; MDL 587

On January 24, 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a Petition for Writ of
Certiorari by the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad (the "B&LE") in the Lower Lake
Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation ("MDL-587"). As a result, the decision of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirming judgments against the B&LE
of approximately $498 million (plus interest) relating to antitrust violations
by the B&LE was permitted to stand. In addition, the Third Circuit decision
remanded the claims of two plaintiffs for retrial of their damage awards. At
trial these plaintiffs asserted claims of approximately $8.1 million, but were
awarded only nominal damages by the jury.

The B&LE was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation throughout
the period the conduct occurred. It is now a subsidiary of Transtar, Inc.
("Transtar"), in which the Corporation has a 45% equity interest. These
actions were excluded liabilities in the sale of the Corporation's
transportation units in 1988, and the Corporation is obligated to reimburse
Transtar for judgments paid by the B&LE.

Following the Court of Appeals decision, the Corporation, which had
previously accrued $90 million on a pre-tax basis for this litigation, charged
an additional amount of $619 million on a pretax basis against the results
of the U.S. Steel Group in the second quarter of 1993. In December 1993,
the Corporation and LTV Steel Corp. ("LTV"), one of the plaintiffs in MDL-587,
agreed to settle all of LTV's claims in that action for $375 million. The
Corporation's potential liability in the LTV portion of the case was estimated
to be in excess of $500 million at year end 1993. The Corporation made a
payment of $200 million to LTV on December 29, 1993 and is obligated to
pay an additional $175 million not later than February 28, 1994. Claims
of three additional plaintiffs were also settled in December 1993. These
settlements resulted in a pretax credit of approximately $127 million in
the fourth quarter financial results of the U.S. Steel Group. As a result
of the denial of the Petition for Writ of Certiorari, judgments for the
remaining MDL-587 plaintiffs (other than those which had been remanded for
retrial), totaling approximately $210 million, including post-judgment interest,
are due for payment in the first quarter of 1994.

SWEPCO Settlement

On January 25, 1994 the Corporation's Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation
("Delhi") subsidiary and Southwestern Electric Power Company ("SWEPCO"),
a subsidiary of Central and South West Corporation ("C&SW"), entered into
a settlement agreement to resolve ongoing litigation which began in 1991.
In SWEPCO v. Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation, No. 56-91, which was
filed in the 276th
<PAGE>

Judicial District Court in Marion County, Texas, on March 7, 1991, SWEPCO
alleged that Delhi had been overcharging for gas sold under a fifteen-year
gas purchase contract which expired in April, 1995 and that Delhi included
gas in its sales under that contract which SWEPCO was not committed to
purchase. SWEPCO sought a refund of alleged overcharges from January 1,
1985 plus interest through the date of final judgment and a determination
that gas being delivered to it since April 1, 1991 was not properly dedicated
to SWEPCO and that at least a portion of the purchase price of such gas
should be refunded. The settlement agreement provides that SWEPCO will pay
Delhi the price under the gas contract through January 1994. The settlement
agreement also provides for a new four-year agreement enabling Delhi to
supply gas to SWEPCO's Wilkes and Lone Star power plants in East Texas at
market sensitive prices. Delhi has also entered into a four-year transportation
agreement to serve C&SW's Central Power and Light Laredo Plant in south
Texas.

Labor Agreement

USX entered into a new five and one-half year contract with the United
Steelworkers of America ("USWA") effective February 1, 1994, covering
approximately 15,000 employees. The agreement will result in higher labor and
benefit costs for the U.S. Steel Group each year throughout the term of the
agreement. The agreement includes a signing bonus of $1,000 per USWA represented
employee that will be paid in the first quarter of 1994, $500 of which
represents the final bonus payable under the existing agreement. Management
believes that this agreement is competitive with labor agreements reached by
U.S. Steel's major domestic integrated competitors and thus does not believe
that U.S. Steel's competitive position with regard to such other competitors
will be materially affected by its ratification.

Sale of Steel Stock

On January 26, 1994 the Corporation executed an Underwriting Agreement
with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated in connection with the issuance of
4,500,000 shares of USX-U.S. Steel Group Common Stock, plus an over-allotment
of 500,000 shares, at a price of $41.00 per share pursuant to a shelf
registration on Form S-3, File No. 033-51621.

of the Firm Stock to the several Underwriters and each of the Underwriters,
severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase the number of shares of the Firm
Stock set opposite that Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto, as such number
may be increased in accordance with Section 9.

In addition, the Corporation hereby grants to the Underwriters an
option to purchase up to 500,000 shares of Option Stock. Such option is granted
solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of Firm Stock and
is exercisable as provided in Section 4 hereof. Shares of Option Stock shall
be purchased severally for the account of the Underwriters in proportion to the
number of shares of Firm Stock set opposite the name of such Underwriters in
Schedule 1 hereto. The respective purchase obligations of each Underwriter with
respect to the Option Stock shall be adjusted by the Representatives so that no
<PAGE>

5
Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase Option Stock other than in 100 share
amounts. The price of both the Firm Stock and any Option Stock shall be $40.18
per share.

The Corporation shall not be obligated to deliver any of the Stock to
be delivered on the First Delivery Date or the Second Delivery Date (each, as
hereinafter defined), as the case may be, except upon payment for all the Stock
to be purchased on such Delivery Date as provided herein.

3. Offering of Stock by the Underwriters. Upon authorization by the
Representatives of the release of the Firm Stock, the several Underwriters
propose to offer the Firm Stock for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth
in the Prospectus.

Except with respect to the United States, no action has been taken or
will be taken in any jurisdiction by the Underwriters or the Corporation that
would permit a public offering of the Stock in any country or jurisdiction where
action for that purpose is required. Each Underwriter severally agrees with the
Corporation that it will observe all applicable laws and regulations in each
other such country or jurisdiction in which it may offer, sell or deliver Stock.
Each Underwriter severally agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly,
offer, sell or deliver Stock or distribute any offering material in relation to
the Stock except under circumstances that will to the best of its knowledge and
belief result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations.

Each Underwriter represents and warrants to the Corporation and
covenants and agrees that (i) it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or
sell, in the United Kingdom, by means of any document, any Stock other than to
persons whose ordinary business it is to buy or sell shares or debentures,
whether as principal or agent (except in circumstances not constituting an offer
to the public within the meaning of the Companies Act 1985, (ii) it has complied
and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services Act
1986 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Stock in, from or
otherwise involving the United Kingdom, and (iii) it has only issued or passed
on and will only issue or pass on to any person in the United Kingdom, any
document received by it in connection with the issuance of the Stock if that
person is of a kind described in Article 9(3) of the Financial Services Act 1986
(Investment Advertisements) (Exemption) Order 1988.

4. Delivery of and Payment for the Stock. Delivery of and payment
for the Firm Stock shall be made at the office of Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York at approximately
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fifth full business day following the

agreement between the Representatives and the Corporation. This date and time
are sometimes referred to as the "First Delivery Date." On the First Delivery
Date, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered certificates
representing the Firm Stock to the Representatives for the account of each
Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of the Corporation of the
purchase price by certified or official bank check or checks payable in New York
Clearing House (next-day) funds. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery of,
and payment for, the Firm Stock at the time and place specified pursuant to this
Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter and the
Corporation hereunder. Upon delivery, the Firm Stock shall be registered in
such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in
writing not less than two full business days prior to the First Delivery Date. 
For the purpose of expediting the checking and packaging of the certificates for

forth the aggregate number of shares of Option Stock as to which the option is

third business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised
nor later than the fifth business day after the date on which the option shall
<PAGE>

between the Representatives and the Corporation) at approximately 10:00 a.m.,

(i) The Corporation and the Designated Subsidiary have been duly
incorporated and are validly existing as corporations in good standing
under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation, are
duly qualified to do business and are in good standing as foreign

proceedings pending to which the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Corporation or

to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, would, individually or
collectively with any claims arising out of similar causes of action,
have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Corporation and

the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and any
further amendment or supplement to any such incorporated document made

filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;

(vii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no
contracts or other documents which are required to be described in the

(x) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, other than with
respect to the Corporation's outstanding convertible debentures and
unsecured senior notes due 1996 and the Restated Rights Agreement,
there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the
Corporation and any person granting such person the right to require
the Corporation to file a registration statement under the Securities

therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading, or that the Prospectus contains any untrue statement of a

therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (II) any
document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further
amendment or supplement to any such incorporated document made by the
Corporation prior to such Delivery Date, when they became effective or were
filed with the Commission, as the case may be, contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the
financial statements and related schedules thereto, as to which such
counsel need express no belief).

(e) J.T. Mills, Vice-President-Taxes of the Corporation, shall have
furnished to the Representatives a letter, addressed to the Underwriters

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that its opinion is
limited to matters governed by the Federal laws of the United States of
America, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware and that such counsel is not admitted in the State
of Delaware. Such counsel shall also have furnished to the Representatives
a written statement, addressed to the Underwriters and dated such Delivery
Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the
effect that (x) in the course of the preparation by the Corporation of the
Prospectus Supplement dated the date hereof relating to the Stock
(excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein), such counsel
participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the
Corporation and with representatives of Price Waterhouse and (y) based upon

were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the

reason to believe that the Registration Statement (including any document
incorporated by reference therein), as of the Effective Date, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus (including any document

bring-down letter (or, with respect to matters involving changes or
developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial
information is given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five
days prior to the date of the bring-down letter), the conclusions and
findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other
matters covered by its letter (the "initial letter") delivered to the
Representatives concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as
to such other matters requested by the Underwriters and (iii) confirming in
all material respects the conclusions and findings set forth in the initial
letter.

(h) The Corporation shall have furnished to the Representatives a
certificate, dated such Delivery Date, of the Chairman of its Board or a
Vice President and its Executive Vice President - Accounting and Finance
and Chief Financial Officer or Vice President & Comptroller stating that:

(i) The representations, warranties and agreements of the
Corporation in Section 1 are true and correct in all material respects
as of such Delivery Date; the Corporation has complied with all its
agreements contained herein; and the conditions set forth in Sections
7(a) and 7(i) have been fulfilled; and

(ii) They have carefully examined the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus and, in their opinion (A) as of the
Effective Date, the Registration Statement and Prospectus did not
<PAGE>

13

include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, and (B) since the
Effective Date, no event has occurred which has resulted in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus including an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.

(i) (i) Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall
have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion,
flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any
labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise
than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus or (ii) since such date there shall not have been any change in
the capital stock or long-term debt of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or any change, or any development likely to involve a
prospective change, in or affecting the management, consolidated financial
position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries or the financial position, stockholders' equity or
results of operations of the U.S. Steel Group, otherwise than as set forth
or contemplated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, the
effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is, in
the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the
delivery of the Stock being delivered on such Delivery Date on the terms
and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

(j) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement there
shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) trading in securities
generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or

such exchanges or such market by the Commission, by such exchange or by any
other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (ii) a
banking moratorium shall have been declared by United States federal or New
York state authorities, (iii) the United States shall have become engaged
in hostilities, there shall have been an escalation in hostilities
involving the United States or there shall have been a declaration of a
national emergency or war by the United States or (iv) there shall have
occurred either (A) any outbreak of hostilities or an escalation of
hostilities or a declaration of a national emergency or war or (B) such a
material adverse change in national or international economic, political or
financial conditions, national or international equity markets or currency
exchange rates or controls as to make it, in either case, in the judgment
of a majority in interest of the several Underwriters, inadvisable or
impractical to proceed with the payment for and delivery of the Stock.

All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the
provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters.

8. Indemnification and Contribution.

(a) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the
meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or
liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which that
Underwriter or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act
or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises
out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or
(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling
person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter
or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or
preparing to defend against any
<PAGE>

14

such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be liable in any such case to
the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of,
or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or in any such amendment or supplement in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Corporation
through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for
inclusion therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any
liability which the Corporation may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any
controlling person of that Underwriter.

(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Corporation, each of its directors, each of its officers who
signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the
Corporation within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss,
claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof,
to which the Corporation or any such director, officer or controlling person may
become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any
amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that
the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Corporation through the Representatives by or on behalf of that
Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the
Corporation and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Corporation or any such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or
preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as
such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to
any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Corporation or any
such director, officer or controlling person.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section
8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that
the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this
Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified
party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it
wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After
notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to
assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however,
any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action and to participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the
employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party in
writing, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying
party has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action
on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate
but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising
out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any
time for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing
by the Representatives, if the indemnified parties under this Section 8 consist
<PAGE>

15

of any Underwriter or any of their respective controlling persons, or by the
Corporation, if the indemnified parties under this Section 8 consist of the
Corporation or any of the Corporation's directors, officers or controlling
persons. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding
in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless
such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for
any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or
liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in
such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Corporation on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other
from the offering of the Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i)
above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but
also the relative fault of the Corporation on the one hand and the Underwriters
on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such
loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Corporation on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to
such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net
proceeds from the offering of the Stock purchased under this agreement (before
deducting expenses) received by the Corporation bear to the total underwriting
discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the
shares of the Stock purchased under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in
the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by the Corporation or the Underwriters, the intent of
the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Corporation and the
Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even
if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect
thereof, referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, for
purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no
Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
by which the total price at which the Stock underwritten by it and distributed
to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which
such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations
to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to
their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.

(e) The Underwriters severally confirm that the statements with respect
to the public offering of the Stock set forth on the cover page of, and under
the caption "Underwriting" in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the
only information furnished in writing to the Corporation by or on behalf of the
Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus.

(f) The agreements contained in this Section 8 and the
representations, warranties and agreements of the Corporation in Sections 1, 5
and 6 shall survive the delivery of the Stock and shall remain in full force
and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or
any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

9. Defaulting Underwriters.

If, on either Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance
of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting
Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Stock which the defaulting
Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date in the
respective proportions which the number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite
the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears
to the total number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the names of all
the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; provided,
however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated
to purchase any of the Stock on such Delivery Date if the total number of shares
of the Stock which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed
to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of shares of the
Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting
Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of
shares of the Stock which it agreed to purchase on such Delivery Date pursuant
to the terms of Section 2. The respective purchase obligations of the non-
defaulting Underwriters shall be rounded among the non-defaulting Underwriters
to avoid fractional shares, as the Representatives shall determine. If the
foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or
those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives and the Corporation
who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in
such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Stock to be purchased
on such Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters
satisfactory to the Representatives and the Corporation do not elect to purchase
the shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed
to purchase, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of
any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Corporation, except that the Corporation
will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth
in Sections 6 and 11.

Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any
liability it may have to the Corporation for damages caused by its default. If
other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Stock of a defaulting
or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Corporation may
postpone the First Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to
effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation or counsel
for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.

10. Termination. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may
be terminated by the Representatives, in their absolute discretion, by notice
given to and received by the Corporation prior to delivery of any payment for
the Firm Stock if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections
7(i) or 7(j) shall have occurred.

11. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If (a) the Corporation
shall fail to tender the Stock for delivery to the Underwriters for any reason
permitted under this Agreement or (b) the Underwriters shall decline to purchase
the Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement (including the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10), the Corporation shall
reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel
and for such other out-of-pocket expenses as shall have been reasonably incurred
by them in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the
Stock, and upon demand the Corporation shall pay the full amount thereof to the
Representatives. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9 by
reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Corporation shall not be
obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.

12. Notices, etc. All statements, requests, notices and agreements
hereunder shall be in writing, and:

(a) if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail,
telex or facsimile transmission to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated,
1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020 Attention:

agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. The Corporation
shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement
given or made on behalf of the Underwriters by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
on behalf of the Representatives.

13. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Corporation
and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions
hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (A) the

in accordance with the terms of the Agreement between Underwriters and (B) the
indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in Section 8(b) of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Corporation,
officers of the Corporation who have signed the Registration Statement and any
person controlling the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to

legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement
or any provision contained herein.

counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

17. Headings. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of
reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of, this Agreement.
