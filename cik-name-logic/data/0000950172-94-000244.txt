ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On November 30, 1994, Metro Bancshares Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Metro"), was merged (the "Merger") with
and into North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware corpora-
tion ("North Fork"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of June 27, 1994, by and between North Fork and Metro
(the "Merger Agreement"). Immediately following the Merger,
North Fork merged Bayside Federal Savings Bank, a federally-
chartered stock savings bank and a former wholly owned subsid-
iary of Metro, with and into North Fork Bank, a New York
chartered stock commercial bank and a wholly owned subsidiary
of North Fork.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share of Metro, outstanding
immediately prior to consummation of the Merger was converted
into 1.645 shares of the common stock, par value $2.50 per
share, of North Fork (the "Common Stock") and a like-number of
associated rights (the "Rights") to purchase shares of North
Fork's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The
Rights are not currently separate from the shares of the Common
Stock and are not currently exercisable. North Fork expects to
issue approximately 9,200,000 shares of Common Stock in connec-
tion with the Merger.
