reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

(ii) Subject to the Commitments, each Designated
Subsidiary may borrow and have L/Cs issued pursuant hereto in an aggregate
principal amount of Loans and undrawn amount of L/Cs outstanding at any one
time up to (x) the Designated Subsidiary Borrowing Limit for such Designated
Subsidiary plus (y) $7,500,000, provided that such additional $7,500,000 shall

Designated Subsidiary otherwise permitted by this Agreement ("PERMITTED

issuance of an L/C hereunder. NWUSA shall notify the Company of any payment or
disbursement made by NWUSA under any L/C in accordance with its customary
practice. The Company or any Designated Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall
reimburse NWUSA

(ii) Upon the presentation and payment of a draft pursuant
to any L/C and reimbursement of the issuer of the L/C in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof, the face amount of such L/C shall be added to the
Available L/C Commitment against which L/Cs can be issued hereunder.

(iii) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this
subsection 2.1(c), on the Termination Date there are outstanding any L/Cs which
have not expired or been terminated with the consent of the Company and the
respective beneficiaries thereof, then this Agreement (including, without
limitation, this subsection 2.1(c) and subsection 2.22 hereof) and the
respective rights, obligations and covenants of the Company and the Designated
Subsidiaries and NWUSA under this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect until the date on which the last of the L/Cs expire or is terminated
(with the consent of the Company and the respective beneficiaries thereof) and
all payments made by NWUSA under the L/Cs are reimbursed in full by the Company
or one or more of the Designated Subsidiaries except that the Commitment
(including the obligation to issue L/Cs) shall terminate on the Termination
Date and NWUSA and the Banks shall have no obligation after the Termination
Date to make Credit Loans or issue L/Cs hereunder.

(iv) Upon the execution and delivery by the Company or a

Company to NWUSA in the case of each stand-by and trade L/C of the standard
charges and fees then customarily imposed by NWUSA in connection with such

timely manner in accordance with its standard operating procedures, issue a
trade L/C or a stand-by L/C for the account of the Company or such Designated
Subsidiary, as the case may be.

under a trade L/C, the Company shall pay to NWUSA for the ratable benefit of
the Banks a payment commission or fee (each a "DRAWING FEE") equal to one
quarter of one percent (1/4%) of the face amount of the draft.

(vi) The Company shall pay to the Agent for the ratable
benefit of the Banks an Issuance Fee for each stand-by L/C, in an

26
<PAGE> 32
amount at an annual rate equal to the percentage of the undrawn amount of such
L/C set forth in the definition of Issuance Fee, and payable on the date of
issuance and thereafter in advance on the first day of each January, April,
July and October so long as such L/C is outstanding (pro rated for the portion
of any quarter during which the undrawn amount of such L/C is reduced or the
L/C is terminated).

(vii) In the event that at any time when a draft is drawn
under an L/C, there are not sufficient funds in any account of the Account
Party with NWUSA or sufficient Available Commitments to permit creation of a
Swing Line Loan or a Credit Loan sufficient to fund payment of such draft, any
funds advanced by NWUSA, in payment thereof shall be due and payable
immediately and shall bear interest until paid in full at the Post-Default
Rate. In the event of any conflict, discrepancy or any omission of terms
provided herein between the terms established by NWUSA in its Application or
otherwise and this Agreement, the terms provided herein shall prevail.

(viii) The obligations of the Company or any Designated
Subsidiary, as the case may be, under this subsection 2.1(c) to reimburse NWUSA
with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including interest thereon) shall, subject to
the other provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation subsection
2.22, be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and (but as
so subject) irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which the Company or any Designated Subsidiary may have or have had against
NWUSA, including (without limitation, but as so subject) any defense based on
the failure of any drawing under the L/C to conform to the terms of such L/C or
any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the L/C of the
proceeds of such drawing.

that the Notes evidencing the Credit Loans made pursuant to subsection
2.1(a)(ii) for Permitted Subsidiary Acquisitions shall be substantially in the

date, Type and amount of each Credit Loan, the maturity date therefor and the
date and amount of each repayment of principal thereof, and, in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, the interest rate with respect thereto, either on its own
books and records or on the schedule (or any continuations thereof) annexed to
and constituting a part of its Note, and any such recordation shall constitute
prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded; provided
that the failure to make any such recordation shall not in any way affect the
Company's and the Designated Subsidiaries' obligation to repay the Credit
Loans. Each Credit Note shall (a) be dated the date hereof, (b) mature, with
respect to each Credit Loan evidenced thereby, on the last day of the Interest
Period relating thereto and, with respect to all Credit Loans, on the

prior to the requested borrowing date, in the case of NWUSA Rate Loans,
specifying (i) the borrower and the amount to be borrowed, (ii) the requested
borrowing date, (iii) whether the borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Loan, NWUSA
Rate Loan or a combination thereof and, if a combination, the respective amount
of each Type of borrowing and (iv) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the length
of the Interest Period with respect thereto. Each borrowing under the
Commitments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the lesser of: (x) the
then Available Commitments, and (y) (i) in the case of NWUSA Rate Loans,
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) in the
case of Eurodollar Loans, $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Company, the Agent
shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Except as provided in paragraph (c)
below, each Bank will make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing
available to the Agent for the account of the Company at the office of the
Agent set forth on its signature page hereto by 11:00 A.M., New York City time,
on the borrowing date requested by the Company in funds immediately available
to the Agent. The proceeds of all such Credit Loans will then be made

28
<PAGE> 34
available to the Company or the applicable Designated Subsidiary, as the case
may be, by the Agent at such office of the Agent by crediting the account of
the Company or such Designated Subsidiary on the books of such office with the
aggregate of the amounts made available to the Agent by the Banks and in like
funds as received by the Agent.

(b) The provisions of subsection 2.3(a) notwithstanding, if the
Company shall not have given a timely notice of a borrowing to be made on the
last day of any Interest Period for an outstanding Credit Loan, then unless the
Agent shall have received notice that the Company elects not to make a
borrowing on the last day of such Interest Period (such notice to have been
received at least one Business Day prior to the last day of such Interest
Period) the Company shall be deemed irrevocably to have requested that NWUSA
Rate Loans be made by the Banks on the last day of such Interest Period in the
same aggregate amount as the Credit Loans maturing on such day (subject,
however, to the requirement that the aggregate amount of the Credit Loans
outstanding at any time pursuant to subsection 2.1 may not exceed the amounts
of the Available Commitments then in effect).

(c) If any Bank makes a new Credit Loan on a day on which the
Company or any Designated Subsidiary is to repay all or any part of any
outstanding Credit Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of
its new Credit Loan to make such repayment, and only an amount equal to the
difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being
repaid shall be made available by such Bank to the Agent as provided in
paragraph (a) above or, as the case may be, remitted by the Company to the
Agent.

(d) The proceeds of the initial Loans hereunder shall be applied
to the payment in full of the principal, interest and any other amounts payable
with respect to the Indebtedness listed in Part A of Schedule III.

2.4 SWING LINE BORROWINGS.

(A) SWING LINE COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make SWING LINE LOANS ("SWING LINE
LOANS") to the Company or any Designated Subsidiary on any Business Day from
time to time during the Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at
any one time outstanding not to exceed $7,500,000 and in the case of each Swing
Line Loan for a term not to exceed sixty (60) days (for this purpose,
repayments by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary shall be applied to
Swing Line Loans in the order that such Loans were borrowed (i.e.,
"first-in-first-out"); and, without limitation, a Swing Line Loan will be
deemed repaid upon the refinancing thereof with a Credit Loan); provided,
however, that in no event may the amount of any borrowing of Swing Line Loans
(i) exceed the aggregate Available Commitments of all Banks

29
<PAGE> 35
immediately prior to such borrowing (after giving effect to such borrowing) or
(ii) cause the outstanding Credit Loans of any Bank, when added to such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of the then outstanding Swing Line Loans and Commitment
Percentage of Bank L/C Obligations (after giving effect to such borrowing) to
exceed such Bank's Commitment.

(B) SWING LINE NOTE. The Swing Line Loans shall be evidenced by a
promissory note of the Company and each Designated Subsidiary substantially in
the form of Exhibit B, with appropriate insertions (the "SWING LINE NOTE"),
payable to the order of the Swing Line Lender and representing the obligation
of the Company and each Designated Subsidiary to pay the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Swing Line Loans, with interest thereon as prescribed
in subsection 2.10. The Swing Line Lender is hereby authorized to record the
borrowing date, the amount of each Swing Line Loan and the date and amount of
each payment or prepayment of principal thereof, on the schedule annexed to and
constituting a part of the Swing Line Note (or otherwise on the records of the
Swing Line Lender) and any such recordation shall constitute prime facie
evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded; provided, however,
that the failure of the Swing Line Lender to make such recordation (or any
error in such recordation) shall not affect the obligations of the Company and
each Designated Subsidiary to repay the Swing Line Loans. The Swing Line Note
shall (a) be dated the date hereof, (b) mature on the Termination Date and (c)
bear interest for the period from the Closing Date on the unpaid principal
amount thereof from time to time outstanding at the applicable interest rate
per annum determined as provided in, and payable as specified in, subsection
2.10.

(C) PROCEDURE FOR SWING LINE BORROWING. The Swing Line Loans
shall be made and maintained as NWUSA Rate Loans. The Company shall give the
Swing Line Lender irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the
Swing Line Lender prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time), on the requested
borrowing date (which shall be a Business Day) specifying the borrower and the
amount of each requested Swing Line Loan, which shall be in a minimum amount of
$100,000 or a multiple thereof. The proceeds of each Swing Line Loan will then
be made available to the Company or a Designated Subsidiary, as applicable, by
the Swing Line Lender by crediting the account of the Company or such
Designated Subsidiary on the books of the office of the Swing Line Lender
specified on the signature page hereto with such proceeds.

(D) REFUNDING OF SWING LINE LOANS. The Swing Line Lender, at any
time in its sole and absolute discretion, may on behalf of the Company or a
Designated Subsidiary, as applicable (which hereby irrevocably directs the
Swing Line Lender to so act on its behalf), request each Bank to make a Credit
Loan in an amount equal to such Bank's Commitment Percentage of the prin-

30
<PAGE> 36
cipal amount of the Swing Line Loans (the "REFUNDED SWING LINE LOANS")
outstanding on the date such notice is given. Unless any of the events
described in subsection 7(f) shall have occurred (in which event the procedures
of paragraph (E) of this subsection 2.4 shall apply) and regardless of whether
the conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement to the making of a Credit
Loan are then satisfied, each Bank shall make the proceeds of its Credit Loan
available to the Swing Line Lender at its office set forth on its signature
page hereto prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City time, in funds immediately
available on the Business Day next succeeding the date such notice is given.
The proceeds of such Credit Loans shall be immediately applied to repay the
Refunded Swing Line Loans.

(E) PARTICIPATION IN SWING LINE LOANS. If, prior to the making of
a Credit Loan pursuant to paragraph (D) of this subsection 2.4, one of the
events described in subsection 7(f) shall have occurred, then, subject to the
provisions of subparagraph 2.4(F) below, each Bank will, on the date such
Credit Loan was to have been made, purchase from the Swing Line Lender an
undivided participating interest in an amount equal to the Commitment
Percentage of such Bank in the Refunded Swing Line Loans. Upon request, each
Bank will immediately transfer to the Swing Line Lender, in immediately
available funds, the amount of its participation.

(F) BANKS' OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. Each Bank's obligation to
make Credit Loans in accordance with clause (d) and to purchase participating
interests in accordance with clause (E) above shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without
limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Bank may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Company, any
Designated Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the
occurrence or continuance of any Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in
the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company, any Designated
Subsidiary or any other Person; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the
Company, any Designated Subsidiary or any other Person; (v) any inability of
the Company or any Designated Subsidiary to satisfy the conditions precedent to
borrowing set forth in this Agreement on the date upon which such participating
interest is to be purchased or (vi) any other circumstance, happening or event
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. If any Bank does
not make available to the Swing Line Lender the amount required pursuant to
clause (d) or (e) above, as the case may be, the Swing Line Lender shall be
entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank, together with
interest thereon for each day from the date of non-payment until such amount is
paid in full at the Federal funds rate as described in subsection 2.19(b).

31
<PAGE> 37
2.5 COMPETITIVE BORROWINGS. (A) THE COMPETITIVE BID OPTION. In
addition to the Loans which may be made available pursuant to subsection 2.1,
the Company may, as set forth in this subsection 2.5, request the Banks to make
offers to make Competitive Bid Loans to the Company or any Designated
Subsidiary during the Commitment Period; provided, however, that at no time
shall the aggregate amount of Credit Loans, Swing Line Loans, Competitive Bid
Loans and Bank L/C Obligations exceed the aggregate Commitments then in effect
of all the Banks; and provided further, that at no time shall the outstanding
principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans exceed $50,000,000. The Banks may,
but shall have no obligation to, make such offers, and the Company and the
Designated Subsidiaries may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such
offers in the manner set forth in this subsection 2.5. Upon the request of any
Bank making a Competitive Bid Loan, the Company or a Designated Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall execute and deliver a promissory note with respect to
Competitive Bid Loans to be made by such Bank, substantially in the form of
Exhibit C-1 with appropriate insertions as to payee and date (each, a
"COMPETITIVE BID NOTE"), payable to the order of such Bank and in a principal
amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Competitive Bid
Loans, if any, made by such Bank.

(B) COMPETITIVE BID REQUEST. When the Company wishes to request
offers to make Competitive Bid Loans under this subsection 2.5, it shall
transmit to the Agent a Competitive Bid Request to be received no later than
12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the fourth Working Day prior to the
requested date of borrowing, specifying:

(i) the name of the proposed borrower,

(ii) the proposed date of borrowing, which shall be a
Business Day,

(iii) the aggregate principal amount of such borrowing,
which shall be $5,000,000 or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and

(iv) the duration of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period
contained in subsection 1.1.

A Competitive Bid Request that does not conform substantially to the format of
Exhibit C-2 may be rejected by the Agent in its sole discretion, and the Agent
shall promptly notify the Company of such rejection. The Company may request
offers to make Competitive Bid Loans for more than one Interest Period in a
single Competitive Bid Request. No Competitive Bid Request shall be given
within three Business Days of any other Competitive Bid Request.

32
<PAGE> 38
(C) INVITATION FOR COMPETITIVE BIDS. Promptly after its receipt
of a Competitive Bid Request (but, in any event, no later than 3:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the date of the Agent's receipt of such Competitive Bid
Request conforming to the requirements of paragraph (b) above) the Agent shall
send to each of the Banks an Invitation for Competitive Bids which shall
constitute an invitation by the Company to each such Bank to bid, on the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, to make Competitive Bid Loans pursuant to the
Competitive Bid Request.

(D) SUBMISSION AND CONTENTS OF COMPETITIVE BIDS.

(i) Each Bank to which an Invitation for Competitive Bids is sent
may, but shall have no obligation to, submit a Competitive Bid containing an
offer or offers to make Competitive Bid Loans in response to such Invitation
for Competitive Bids. Each Competitive Bid must comply with the requirements
of this paragraph (D) and must be submitted to the Agent at its offices
specified on its signature page hereto not later than 9:30 A.M. (New York City
time) provided, however, that any Competitive Bid submitted by the Agent must
be submitted by no later than 9:15 A.M. (New York City time) in each case, on
the third Business Day prior to the requested date of borrowing. A Competitive
Bid submitted by a Bank pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be irrevocable.

(ii) Each Competitive Bid shall be in substantially the
form of Exhibit C-4 and shall specify:

(A) the identity of the borrower and the date of the
proposed borrowing,

(B) the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for
which each such offer is being made, the principal amount (w) may be
greater than, equal to or less than, the Available Commitment of the
quoting Bank, (x) must be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000
or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (y) may not exceed the
principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers were
requested and (z) if more than one offer is quoted by such Bank, may
be subject to a limitation as to the maximum aggregate principal
amount of Competitive Bid Loans for which offers being made by such
quoting Bank may be accepted,

(C) the rate offered for each Competitive Bid Loan, and

(D) the identity of the quoting Bank.

A Competitive Bid may set forth up to two separate offers by the quoting Bank
with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation for
Competitive Bids. Any Competitive Bid shall be disregarded by the Agent if the
Agent determines that

33
<PAGE> 39
it: (A) is not substantially in the form of Exhibit C-4 or does not specify all
of the information required by subsection 2.5(d)(ii); (B) contains qualifying,
conditional or similar language (except for a limitation on the maximum
principal amount which may be accepted); (C) proposes terms other than or in
addition to those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Competitive Bids
or (D) arrives after the time set forth in subsection 2.5(d)(i).

(E) NOTICE TO THE COMPANY. The Agent shall promptly (and, in any
event, by 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of receipt of Competitive
Bids) notify the Company, by telecopy, of all the Competitive Bids made, the
Competitive Bid Rate and the principal amount of each Competitive Bid Loan in
respect of which a Competitive Bid was made and the identity of the Bank that
made each bid. The Agent shall send a copy of all Competitive Bids to the
Company for its records as soon as practicable after completion of the bidding
process set forth in this subsection 2.5.

(F) ACCEPTANCE AND NOTICE BY THE COMPANY. The Company may in its
sole discretion, subject only to the provisions of this paragraph (F), accept
or reject any Competitive Bid referred to in paragraph (E) above. The Company
shall notify the Agent by telephone, confirmed immediately thereafter by
telecopy in the form of a Competitive Bid Accept/Reject Letter, whether and to
what extent it wishes to accept any or all of the bids referred to in paragraph
(E) above not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time), on the second Working
Day prior to the requested date of borrowing; provided, however, that:

(i) the failure by the Company to give such notice shall be deemed
to be a rejection of all the bids referred to in paragraph (E) above;

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bids
accepted by the Company may not exceed the lesser of (A) the principal amount
set forth in the related Competitive Bid Request and (B) the excess, if any, of
the aggregate Commitments of all Banks then in effect over the aggregate
principal amount of all Loans and Bank L/C Obligations outstanding immediately
prior to the making of such Competitive Bid Loans (after giving effect to the
use of proceeds thereof);

(iii) the principal amount of each Competitive Bid borrowing must be
$5,000,000 or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;

(iv) unless there are any limitations contained in a quoting Bank's
Competitive Bid, the Company may not accept a Competitive Bid made at a
particular Competitive Bid Rate if it has decided to reject any portion of a
bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate for the same Interest Period, and

34
<PAGE> 40
(v) the Company may not accept any Competitive Bid that is
disregarded by the Agent pursuant to subsection 2.5(D)(ii) or that otherwise
fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement.

A notice given by the Company pursuant to this paragraph (F) shall be
irrevocable.

(G) ALLOCATION BY THE AGENT. If offers are made by two or more
Banks with the same Competitive Bid Rates for a greater aggregate principal
amount than the amount in respect of which such offers are accepted for the
related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in
respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among
such Banks as nearly as possible (in integral multiples of $1,000,000), as the
Agent may deem appropriate in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of
such offers.

(H) NOTIFICATION OF ACCEPTANCE. The Agent shall promptly (and, in
any event, by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time)) on the date of receipt of the
Competitive Bid Accept/Reject Letter notify each bidding Bank whether or not
its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and if so, in what amount and at what
Competitive Bid Rate), and each successful bidder will thereupon become bound,
subject to the other applicable conditions hereof, to make the Competitive Bid
Loan in respect of which its bid has been accepted.

(I) FUNDING OF THE COMPETITIVE BID LOANS. Each Bank which has
received notice pursuant to subsection 2.5(h) that its Competitive Bid has been
accepted, shall make the amounts of such Loans available to the Agent for the
account of the Company at the Agent's payment office by 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) on such date of borrowing, by payment in funds immediately available
to and freely transferable to the Agent. Unless any applicable condition
specified in Section 4 has not been satisfied, the proceeds of all such Loans
will then be made available to the Company or the applicable Designated
Subsidiary by the Agent at such office by crediting the account of the Company
or the applicable Designated Subsidiary with the aggregate of the amounts made
available to the Agent by the Banks and in like funds as received by the Agent.

(J) NO ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. Nothing in this subsection 2.5 shall be
construed as a right of first offer in favor of the Banks or otherwise to limit
the ability of the Company or any Subsidiary to request and accept any other
credit facilities from any Person (including any of the Banks); provided,
however, that no Event of Default or Default would otherwise arise or exist as
a result of the Company or any Subsidiary executing, delivering, or performing
under any such other credit facility.

35
<PAGE> 41
(K) REDUCTION OF AVAILABLE COMMITMENTS. Each outstanding
Competitive Bid Loan shall reduce by such amount the aggregate Available
Commitments of all the Banks (and, accordingly, the Available Commitment of
each Bank proportionate to its Commitment Percentage), but shall not otherwise
reduce or affect the Available Commitment or Commitment of any Bank which makes
a Competitive Bid Loan.

2.6 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. (a) The Company
shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the
Agent, to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount
of the Commitments, provided that no such reduction or termination shall be
permitted if, after giving effect thereto, and to any prepayments of the Loans
made on the effective date thereof, the then outstanding principal amount of
the Loans and Bank L/C Obligations would exceed the amount of the Commitments
then in effect. Any such reduction shall be in an amount of $5,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the
amount of the Commitments then in effect.

(b) The Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be
reinstated.

2.7 FEES. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank the Facility Fee for the period commencing on the date
hereof extending to but not including the earlier of (i) the date the
Commitments are terminated or (ii) the Termination Date. The accrued Facility
Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each January,
April, July and October and on the Termination Date or such earlier date as the
Commitments shall terminate as provided herein, commencing on the first of such
dates to occur after the date hereof.

(b) The Company agrees to pay to the Agent the additional fees in
the amounts and upon the terms set forth in the Fee Letter.

2.8 OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS AND COMMITMENT REDUCTIONS.
(a) The Company and each Designated Subsidiary may at any time and from time to
time prepay the Credit Loans then outstanding, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty, provided, however, that Eurodollar Loans may only be
prepaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto, provided, that the Company and each Designated Subsidiary may, subject
to the requirement that it pay any amounts due under subsection 2.16 in
connection therewith, prepay Eurodollar Loans at any time. Optional
prepayments pursuant to this subsection 2.8(a) shall be made upon at least
three Working Days' prior irrevocable notice to the Agent in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, and one Business Day's prior irrevocable notice to the Agent
in the case of NWUSA Rate Loans, specifying (i) the date and amount of such
prepayment, (ii) whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar

36
<PAGE> 42
Loans, NWUSA Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination
thereof, the amount of prepayment allocable to each Type and (iii) in the case
of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Periods affected. If any such notice is
given, the Company or the Designated Subsidiary involved will make the
prepayment specified therein, and such prepayment shall be due and payable on
the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on the
amount prepaid. Each prepayment of the Credit Loans pursuant to this paragraph
(a) shall be in an amount equal to (A) in the case of NWUSA Rate Loans $500,000
or any whole multiple of $100,000 thereof or, if less, the amount of all Credit
Loans, then outstanding as NWUSA Rate Loans and (B) in the case of Eurodollar
Loans, $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or the
amount of all Credit Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans provided that
prepayments of Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall be made in
such a manner that, after giving effect to such prepayments, no Eurodollar
Loans having the same Interest Period shall be maintained in an amount less
than $1,000,000.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither the Company nor any Designated Subsidiary shall prepay the Competitive
Bid Loans except pursuant to Section 7.

(c) Upon notice to the Agent on any Business Day, the Company and
each Designated Subsidiary may prepay, without premium or penalty, any Swing
Line Loans on such Business Day not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time).
Partial prepayments of Swing Line Loans shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple thereof, or the entire principal balance
thereof.

(d) The Company shall prepay the Credit Loans then outstanding and
reduce the Commitments forthwith upon the receipt by the Company of Net
Proceeds of an Asset Sale:

(i) of a business unit or units or any product line or group of
product lines which had annual sales in excess of $50,000,000; or

(ii) which, together with the Net Proceeds received from other
Asset Sales (other than Asset Sales described in clause (i)) during the term of
this Agreement exceeds in the aggregate the following amounts:

each such prepayment and Commitment reduction, if pursuant to clause (i), to be
in amount equal to 80% of the amount of the Net Proceeds received, and if
pursuant to clause (ii), to be in an amount equal to 80% of the amount of the
aggregate Net Proceeds received from all such Asset Sales (other than Asset
Sales described in clause (i)) in excess of the amount set forth on the chart
above relating to the year in which the Asset Sale was consummated.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (d) above, the
full amount of the Net Proceeds received by the Company or any Subsidiary from
the sale of accounts receivable other than the sale of an amount at any time
outstanding up to $20,000,000 shall be applied by the Company or any Subsidiary
to the prepayment of Credit Loans and Commitment reduction forthwith upon
receipt thereof by the Company or any such Subsidiary.

2.9 REPAYMENT OF CREDIT LOANS. The Company or the applicable
Designated Subsidiary will pay the unpaid principal amount of each Credit Loan
on the last day of the Interest Period therefor.

2.10 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES. (a) Each Eurodollar
Loan shall bear interest for the Interest Period with respect thereto on the
unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.

(b) The NWUSA Rate Loans (including the Swing Line Loans) shall
bear interest on the aggregate unpaid principal amount thereof for the Interest
Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the NWUSA Rate plus
the Applicable Margin.

(c) Competitive Bid Loans shall bear interest as set forth in
subsection 2.5.

(d) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any of the
Loans shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), such overdue principal amount shall, without
limiting the rights of the Banks under Section 7, bear interest at a rate per
annum which is two percent (2%) above the NWUSA Rate (the "POST-DEFAULT RATE"),
from the

38
<PAGE> 44
date of such non-payment until paid in full (before, as well as after,
judgment); provided, that if such overdue principal amount is of Eurodollar
Loans, such Loans may, at the end of the Interest Period relating thereto, be
reborrowed only as NWUSA Rate Loans and shall bear interest at a rate per annum
which is two (2%) above the NWUSA Rate until paid in full (before as well as
after judgment).

(e) Interest on each Credit Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto.

(f) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
obligation of the Company and each Designated Subsidiary to make payments of
interest shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not
be required to be made to any Bank to the extent that such Bank's receipt
thereof would not be permissible under the law or laws applicable to such Bank
limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Bank. Any
such payments of interest which are not made to any Bank as a result of the
limitation referred to in the preceding sentence shall be made by the Company
and each Designated Subsidiary to such Bank on the earliest interest payment
date or dates on which the receipt thereof would be permissible under the laws
applicable to such Bank limiting rates of interest which may be charged or
collected by the Agent.

2.11 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. (a) The Facility Fee and
interest in respect of NWUSA Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a
365 (or 366, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.
Interest on all Eurodollar Loans and Competitive Bid Loans and Issuance Fees
and the fees payable pursuant to subsection 2.7(b) shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. The Agent shall as soon
as practicable, but not later than the close of business on the date of
determination, notify the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries and the Banks
of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on
the Credit Loans resulting from a change in the NWUSA Rate or the Eurocurrency
Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on
the day on which such change in the NWUSA Rate is announced, or such change in
the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective, as the case may
be. The Agent shall as soon as practicable, but not later than three Business
Days before the close of business on the effective date, notify the Company and
the Designated Subsidiaries and the Banks of the effective date and the amount
of each such change.

(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent pursuant
to any provision of this Agreement shall be prima facie evidence of the
accuracy of the facts so determined.

2.12 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, in the event that

39
<PAGE> 45
the Required Banks shall reasonably have determined (which determination shall
be prima facie evidence of the facts so determined) that the rates quoted by
NWUSA for the purpose of computing the Eurodollar Base Rate do not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of funding any Credit Loans that the
Company or any Designated Subsidiary has requested be made as Eurodollar Loans,
such Banks shall notify the Agent thereof and the Agent shall promptly give
telecopier or telephonic notice of such determination, confirmed in writing to
the Company or such Designated Subsidiary and the Banks at least one Business
Day prior to the requested borrowing date for such Eurodollar Loans. Unless
the Company or such Designated Subsidiary shall have notified the Agent
promptly after receipt of such telecopier or telephonic notice that it wishes
to rescind or modify its request regarding such Eurodollar Loans, any requested
Eurodollar Loans shall be made as NWUSA Rate Loans. Until any such notice has
been withdrawn by the Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made. The
Agent shall withdraw such notice promptly after it determines that the
circumstances giving rise to the delivery of such notice no longer exist.

2.13 TAXES. (a) All payments made by the Company and each
Designated Subsidiary under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and
without reduction for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority excluding, in the case of the Agent and each
Bank, net income and franchise taxes imposed on the Agent and such Bank by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Agent or such Bank is organized or
any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or by any
jurisdiction in which such Bank's Domestic Lending Office or Eurodollar Lending
Office, as the case may be, is located or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings being hereinafter called "TAXES"). If any
Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Bank
hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts so payable to such Bank shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Bank (after payment of all
Taxes, including Taxes on such increased amount) interest or any such other
amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this
Agreement and the Notes. Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Company or any
Designated Subsidiary, as promptly as possible thereafter, the Company or such
Designated Subsidiary shall send to the Agent for the account of such Bank a
certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Company showing
payment thereof. If the Company or any Designated Subsidiary fails to pay any
Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the
Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Company
or such Designated Subsidiary shall indemnify the Agent and the Banks for any
incremental taxes,

40
<PAGE> 46
interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Bank as a
result of any such failure. Each Bank confirms to the Company and the
Designated Subsidiaries that tax withholding requirements do not currently
apply to payments to be made to it hereunder.

(b) If the Company or any Designated Subsidiary shall at any time
be required to withhold any Taxes in respect of any amount payable to any Bank
hereunder or under the Notes, the Company or such Designated Subsidiary shall
be entitled to prepay the Credit Loans allocable to such Bank, and the Company
or such Designated Subsidiary shall be entitled to terminate the Commitment of
such Bank (such prepayment to be made together with all other amounts due to
such Bank hereunder and under the Notes, including, without limitation,
interest, fees and any amounts payable pursuant to subsection 2.16).

(c) Each Bank agrees to use reasonable efforts (including
reasonable efforts to change its Domestic Lending Office or Eurodollar Lending
Office, as the case may be) to avoid the imposition of any Taxes on payments
hereunder or to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant
to this subsection; provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause the
imposition on such Bank of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burden
deemed by such Bank to be material.

(d) If the Company or any Designated Subsidiary makes any
additional payment to the Agent or any Bank pursuant to this subsection 2.13 in
respect of any Taxes, and the Agent or such Bank determines that it has
received (i) a refund of such Taxes or (ii) a credit against or relief or
remission for, or a reduction in the amount of, any tax or other governmental
charge solely as a result of any deduction or credit for any Taxes with respect
to which it has received payments under this subsection 2.13, the Agent and
such Bank shall, to the extent that they can do so without prejudice to the
retention of such refund, credit, relief, remission or reduction, pay to the
Company or such Designated Subsidiary such amount as the Agent and such Bank
shall have determined to be attributable to the deduction or withholding of
such Taxes. If the Agent or such Bank later determines that it was not
entitled to such refund, credit, relief, remission or reduction to the full
extent of any payment made pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection
2.13(d), the Company or such Designated Subsidiary shall upon demand of the
Agent or such Bank promptly repay the amount of such overpayment. Any
determination made by the Agent or such Bank pursuant to this subsection
2.13(d) shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy thereof, and
nothing in this subsection 2.13(d) shall be construed as requiring the Agent or
any Bank to conduct its respective business or to arrange or alter in any
respect its respective tax or financial affairs so that it is entitled to
receive such a refund, credit or reduction or as

41
<PAGE> 47
allowing any person to inspect any records, including tax returns, of the Agent
or any Bank.

2.14 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any Regulatory Change shall make it unlawful for any Bank to make or maintain
Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement or to accept deposits in
order to make or maintain such Eurodollar Loans, (a) the agreements of such
Bank hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be suspended for the
duration of such illegality and (b) each Eurodollar Loan then outstanding, if
any, shall be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period therefor or within
such earlier period as required by law and shall be reborrowed on such day and
thereafter as requested by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary only as a
NWUSA Rate Loan or Competitive Bid Loan for the duration of such illegality.
If any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan is made on a day which is not the
last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Company and each Designated
Subsidiary hereby agrees to pay promptly to any Bank, upon its demand, any
amounts required to be paid by the Company and each Designated Subsidiary
pursuant to subsection 2.16 (such Bank's reasonable notice of such costs and
the manner in which they were calculated, as certified to the Company, shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the amounts set forth
therein). This agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement and the
payment of the outstanding Notes. Each Bank shall use its reasonable efforts
to promptly notify the Company as soon as practicable as to any Regulatory
Change described in this subsection 2.14.

2.15 INCREASED COSTS. (a) In the event that any Regulatory
Change:

(i) subjects any Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever with
respect to this Agreement, its Notes or any Loans made by it, or changes the
basis of taxation of payments to such Bank of principal, commitment fee,
interest or any other amount payable hereunder (except for changes in Taxes and
except for taxes measured by the net income of such Bank);

(ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable to any Bank any reserve,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premium or assessment special deposit,
compulsory loan or similar requirement against any Eurodollar Loans made, or
assets held by, or credit extended by, or deposits or other liabilities in or
for the account of, or acquisition of funds by or for the account of, any
office of such Bank (or any corporation controlling any Bank), (but only to the
extent not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate); or

(iii) imposes on such Bank any other condition affecting this
Agreement or any Loans made hereunder;

42
<PAGE> 48
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank of
making or maintaining Loans or Commitments or to reduce any amount receivable
by it in respect of Loans or Commitments, then, in any such case, the Company
or the applicable Designated Subsidiary shall promptly pay the Bank, upon its
demand pursuant to subsection 2.15(c), any additional amounts necessary to
compensate such Bank (or any corporation controlling such Bank) for such
additional cost or reduced amount receivable plus interest thereon at the NWUSA
Rate, for five (5) Business Days from the date demanded and thereafter, at the
Post-Default Rate, in each case until payment in full thereof.

(b) In the event that any Bank (or any corporation controlling
such Bank) shall have reasonably determined that any Regulatory Change does or
shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's (or such
corporation's) capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level
below that which such Bank (or such corporation) could have achieved on the
date hereof but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such
Bank's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by any amount reasonably
deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days
after demand by such Bank pursuant to subsection 2.15(c) hereof, the Company or
the applicable Designated Subsidiary shall promptly pay the Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or such corporation)
for such reduction.

(c) If any Bank (or any corporation controlling any Bank) becomes
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.15, it
shall promptly after becoming aware thereof notify the Company of the event by
reason of which it has become so entitled. Any such claim for additional
amounts by such Bank shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth in
reasonable detail the calculation thereof (provided, however, that such Bank
shall not be required to disclose proprietary or confidential information in
such certificate), submitted by such Bank to the Company, and such certificate
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the amount of such
claim. This agreement shall survive termination of the Commitments and the
payment in full of the outstanding Notes for 180 days (but not longer).

(d) If the Company or any Designated Subsidiary shall at any time
be required to pay amounts pursuant to this subsection 2.15 to a company
controlling any Bank, the Company or such Designated Subsidiary shall be
entitled to prepay the Loans allocable to such Bank, and thereupon the Company
or such Designated Subsidiary shall be entitled to terminate the Commitment of
such Bank (such prepayment to be made together with all other amounts due to
such Bank hereunder and under the Notes, including, without limitation,
interest, fees and any amounts payable pursuant to subsection 2.16).

43
<PAGE> 49
2.16 INDEMNITY. The Company and each Designated Subsidiary
agrees to indemnify each Bank for, and to hold such Bank harmless from, any
loss or expense (but not including loss of Applicable Margin) which such Bank
may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any default by the Company or any
Designated Subsidiary in borrowing or failure to borrow for any reason such
Eurodollar Loans or Competitive Bid Loan after the Company or such Designated
Subsidiary has given a notice in respect thereof in accordance with subsections
2.3 or 2.5, (b) receipt by such Bank of any prepayment (whether optional or
mandatory) of any Eurodollar Loan or Competitive Bid Loan on a day which is not
the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan or
Competitive Bid Loan, (c) default by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary
in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan or Competitive Bid Loan after it
has given a notice in accordance with subsection 2.8(a), or (d) acceleration of
any Eurodollar Loans, and each Bank shall use reasonable efforts to minimize
any amounts due to such Bank pursuant to this subsection 2.16. The Company and
each Designated Subsidiary shall promptly pay to each Bank, upon its demand
(accompanied by the certificate described below), any amounts necessary to
compensate such Bank for such losses or expenses incurred by such Bank in
making or maintaining any Loans in accordance with this subsection 2.16,
including, without limitation, any interest or fees payable by such Bank to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar
Loans. Any claim for additional amounts pursuant to the foregoing sentence by
such Bank shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth in reasonable
detail the calculation thereof (provided, however, that such Bank shall not be
required to disclose proprietary or confidential information in such
certificate), submitted by such Bank to the Company or such Designated
Subsidiary, and such certificate shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
accuracy of the amount of such claim, provided that the determination of such
amount is made on a reasonable basis. This subsection 2.16 shall survive
termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of the outstanding Notes
for 180 days (but not longer).

2.17 MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TRANCHES. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, there shall not at any time be outstanding hereunder Tranches
in excess of the Tranche Limit.

2.18 USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loans may only be used
(i) to refinance existing Indebtedness of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
and (ii) for general corporate purposes, including the financing of
acquisitions.

2.19 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS; L/C PARTICIPATIONS. (a)
Each borrowing of Credit Loans by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary from
the Banks, each payment by the Company on account of any fees hereunder
(including, without limitation, any Issuance Fees and Drawing Fees in respect
of L/Cs (but excluding fees payable pursuant to subsection 2.7(b)),

44
<PAGE> 50
and any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks hereunder shall be made pro
rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the Banks. Each
payment (including each prepayment) by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary
on account of principal of and interest on the Credit Loans and other amounts
due hereunder (other than payments made pursuant to subsection 2.13, 2.14, 2.15
or 2.16 and payments made on account of principal of and interest on
Competitive Bid Loans) shall be made pro rata according to the respective
outstanding principal amounts of the Credit Loans held by each Bank. Each
payment (including each prepayment) by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary
on account of principal of and interest on any borrowing of Competitive Bid
Loans shall be made pro rata among the Banks participating in such borrowing
according to the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Competitive
Bid Loans comprising such borrowing. Each payment by the Company or any
Designated Subsidiary on account of principal of or interest on the Swing Line
Loans shall be made to the Swing Line Lender (except that, to the extent that
any Bank has paid to NWUSA its pro rata share thereof, such Bank shall be
entitled to receive its pro rata share of any payment (other than any payments
made pursuant to subsection 2.15) made to NWUSA in the same manner as is
provided with respect to payments made by L/C Participants in subsection
2.19(c)(ii) and (iii)). All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the
Company or any Designated Subsidiary on account of principal and interest on
the Notes or on account of any fees or other amounts due hereunder shall be
made without set-off or counterclaim and shall be made to the Agent, for the
account of the Banks, at the Agent's office set forth on its signature page
hereto, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately
available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. New York City time, on the date on
which such payment shall become due. The Agent shall distribute such payments
to the Banks promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment
hereunder (other than payments on Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on
a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If
any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Working Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Working Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment
into another calendar month in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Working Day and with respect to payments of principal
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
extension.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by any
Bank prior to a borrowing date that such Bank will not make the amount which
would constitute its Commitment Percentage of the Credit Loans on such date
available to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
amount

45
<PAGE> 51
available to the Agent on such borrowing date, and the Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Company or a Designated Subsidiary,
as applicable, a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the
Agent on a date after such borrowing date, such Bank shall pay to the Agent on
demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily Federal funds rate
during such period set forth for such date opposite the caption "Federal Funds
(Effective)" in the weekly statistical release designated as "H.15 (519)", or
any successor publication published by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, times (ii) the amount of such Bank's Commitment Percentage of
such borrowing, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days that elapse from and including such borrowing date to the date on which
such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing shall have become
immediately available to the Agent and the denominator of which is 365. A
certificate of the Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts
owing under this subsection 2.19(b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
If such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not in fact made
available to the Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such
borrowing date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with
interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Credit Loans
hereunder, on demand, from the Company or a Designated Subsidiary, as
applicable. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, neither
the Company nor the Subsidiaries shall have any liability to any Person under
this subsection 2.19(b).

(c) (i) NWUSA, as the issuing bank with respect to each L/C,
irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each Bank (each Bank, in such
capacity, an "L/C PARTICIPANT") and, to induce NWUSA to maintain or issue L/Cs
hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and
hereby accepts and purchases from NWUSA, on the terms and conditions
hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk an
undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's Commitment Percentage in
NWUSA's obligations and rights under each L/C issued by it hereunder and the
amount of Unpaid Drawings with respect to any draft paid by NWUSA thereunder,
effective, in the case of each L/C, on the date of issuance thereof and, in the
case of Existing Letters of Credit issued by NWUSA, on the Closing Date. Each
L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with NWUSA with respect
to any L/C that, if a draft is paid under such L/C for which NWUSA is not
reimbursed in full by the relevant Account Party on the date required by
subsection 2.1(c)(vii), such L/C Participant shall pay to NWUSA upon
notification or demand at NWUSA's address for notices specified herein an
amount equal to such L/C Participant's Commitment Percentage of the amount of
such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed.

46
<PAGE> 52
(ii) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to 
NWUSA with respect to any L/C pursuant to subsection 2.19(c)(i) in respect of 
any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by NWUSA under such L/C is paid to 
NWUSA within three Business Days after the date such payment is due by such L/C 
Participant, such L/C Participant shall pay to NWUSA on demand an amount equal 
to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal funds 
rate (determined as provided in subsection 2.13(b)) during the period from and 
including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment 
is immediately available to NWUSA, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of 
which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator
of which is 365. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant 
pursuant to subsection 2.19(c)(i) is not in fact made available to NWUSA by 
such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is 
due by such L/C Participant, NWUSA shall be entitled to recover from such L/C 
Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such 
due date at the rate per annum applicable to NWUSA Rate Loans hereunder. A 
certificate of NWUSA submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any 
amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of 
manifest error.

(iii) Whenever, at any time after NWUSA has made payment under any L/C 
and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in 
accordance with subsection 2.19(c)(i), NWUSA receives any payment related to 
such L/C (whether directly from the Company, a Designated Subsidiary or 
otherwise, including by means of set-off or the proceeds of collateral applied 
thereto by NWUSA), or any payment of interest on account thereof, NWUSA will 
distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, 
however, that in the event that any such payment received by NWUSA shall be 
required to be returned by it, such L/C Participant shall return to NWUSA the 
portion thereof previously distributed by NWUSA to it. Neither the Company 
nor any Subsidiary shall have any liability or obligation to any person under 
this subsection 2.19(c).

2.20 GUARANTIES. The due payment and performance of the Obligations 
shall be guaranteed to the Banks and the Agent by the Company and each of the 
Material Operating Subsidiaries listed on Schedule IV hereto and each 
Subsidiary which becomes a Material Operating Subsidiary after the date hereof
(hereinafter referred to individually as a "GUARANTOR" and collectively as the 
"GUARANTORS"), by the execution and delivery to the Agent, simultaneously with 
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, by each Guarantor of a Guaranty 
in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent (hereinafter referred to as a 
"GUARANTY" and, collectively, as to all the Guarantors, the "GUARANTIES"), 
subject to subsection 5.4.

47
<PAGE> 53
2.21 SECURITY. In order to secure the due payment and performance by 
the Company of its Obligations, simultaneously with the execution and delivery 
of this Agreement, the Company shall grant to the Agent for the ratable benefit 
of the Banks:

(a) a first lien on, and pledge with the Agent for the ratable 
benefit of the Banks:

(i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital 
stock of the Existing Pledged Subsidiaries pursuant to the Security Indenture 
and Trust Agreement and simultaneously appoint the Agent as successor Security 
Trustee under the Security Indenture and Trust Agreement; and

(ii) all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital 
stock of the Newly Pledged Subsidiaries, by the execution and delivery of a 
Stock Security Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent (the 
"STOCK SECURITY AGREEMENT"); and

(b) a second lien (subject only to the liens provided for in clause 
(a) above) on, and pledge with the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Banks, 
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Existing 
Pledged Subsidiaries and the Newly Pledged Subsidiaries, by the execution and 
delivery to the Agent of a Pledge Agreement in form and substance satisfactory 
to the Agent (the "COMPANY PLEDGE AGREEMENT"), which shall be executed and 
delivered on the Closing Date;

(c) Upon any Subsidiary becoming a Material Operating Subsidiary, 
the Company shall pledge, or cause the pledge of, all of the capital stock 
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company in that Subsidiary as collateral 
pursuant to the Stock Security Agreement (if still in effect) and/or the 
Company Pledge Agreement; and

(d) In addition, the Company shall execute and deliver or cause to 
be executed and delivered such other agreements, instruments and documents as 
the Agent may reasonably require in order to effect the purposes of the 
Security Indenture and Trust Agreement, the Stock Security Agreement, the 
Company Pledge Agreement, this Section 2.21 and this Agreement.

2.22 ADDITIONAL L/C PROVISIONS. (a) Without limiting the generality 
of subsection 2.15 hereof, if:

(i) any Regulatory Change shall (1) impose, modify or deem applicable
any reserve, special deposit, capital maintenance, deposit insurance premium or
assessment, or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by or
assets held by, or deposits made with or for the account of, NWUSA, (2) impose
on NWUSA any other condition regarding the L/Cs, or (3) subject NWUSA to any
tax, charge, fee, deduction or withholding

48
<PAGE> 54
of any kind whatsoever (except for changes in Taxes and except for taxes
measured by the net income of NWUSA); and

(ii) the result of any such event shall be to increase the cost to 
NWUSA of the issuance or maintenance of the L/Cs, or reduce the amount of 
principal, interest, or any fee or compensation receivable by NWUSA in respect
of the L/Cs; then, upon demand of NWUSA, the Company or a Designated
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall pay to NWUSA, from time to time as specified
by NWUSA, all additional amounts which are necessary to compensate NWUSA for
such increased cost or reduction incurred by NWUSA, accruing from and after the
date initially demanded by NWUSA. All payments of compensation for such
increased cost or reduction shall be accompanied by interest thereon, at the
NWUSA Rate from the date demanded for five (5) Business Days, and thereafter,
at the Post-Default Rate, in each case until payment in full thereof. A
certificate as to such increased cost incurred by NWUSA showing in reasonable
detail the calculation thereof shall be submitted by NWUSA to the Company and
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the amounts set forth
therein. For purposes of this subsection 2.22, all references to L/Cs shall
refer to participations in L/Cs, and all references to "NWUSA" shall be deemed
to include any L/C Participant, except that amounts payable by the Company and
the Designated Subsidiaries shall only be paid to the issuer of the letter of
credit and then delivered to any L/C Participant having such cost. In the
event of any inconsistency between the terms of this subsection 2.22 and
subsection 2.15, the provisions of subsection 2.15 shall govern. This
Agreement shall survive termination of the Commitment and payment of the
outstanding Notes for 180 days (but not longer).

(b) The obligations of the Company and each Designated Subsidiary 
under this Agreement with respect to the L/Cs shall, absent gross negligence 
or willful misconduct by NWUSA, (x) be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, 
and (y) shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including, without limitation, 
the following circumstances:

(i) the L/Cs, the Notes, this Agreement or any other agreements,
instruments or documents relating thereto proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid, unenforceable or insufficient in any respect;

(ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to the departure from 
all or any of the Security Documents and any subsequent such agreements;

(iii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other rights 
which the Company or any Designated Subsidiary may have at any time against any 
beneficiary or any transferee of any

49
<PAGE> 55
beneficiary (or any Persons or entities for whom any beneficiary or any such
transferee may be acting);

(iv) any demand presented under the L/Cs (or any endorsement thereon) 
proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid, unenforceable or insufficient in any 
respect or any statement therein being inaccurate in any respect whatsoever;

(v) the failure of any document to bear reference or to bear adequate
reference to such L/C;

(vi) the use to which the L/Cs may be put or any acts or omissions of
the Company or any Designated Subsidiary or beneficiaries in connection
therewith; or

(vii) any other similar circumstances provided that such circumstances
or happening shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct
of NWUSA. 

(c) NWUSA shall not be responsible: (i) for the validity or
insufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to
transfer or assign the L/Cs or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
thereof in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for
any reason; (ii) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission
or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable telegraph, telex or otherwise,
whether or not they be in cipher; (iii) for any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document or draft required in order to make a
draw under the L/Cs or of proceeds thereof; and (iv) for any consequence
arising from causes beyond the control of NWUSA, provided that this paragraph
(c) shall not apply to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of NWUSA.
None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any of
NWUSA's rights or powers hereunder.

(d) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the 
specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by 
NWUSA, under or in connection with the L/Cs or the related drafts or documents,
unless constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding up
on the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries and shall not put NWUSA under any
resulting liability to the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries.

(e) The Company and each Designated Subsidiary shall at all times 
protect, indemnify and save harmless NWUSA and each Bank from and against any 
and all claims, actions, suits and other legal proceedings, and from and
against any and all loss, claims, demands, and from and against any and all
loss, claims, demands, liabilities, damages, costs, charges, counsel fees and
other expenses which NWUSA or any Bank may, at any time, sustain or incur by
reason of or in consequence of or arising out of the issuance of the L/Cs; it
being the intention of the parties that

50
<PAGE> 56
this Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and indemnify NWUSA
and each Bank against any and all risk involved in the issuance of the L/Cs,
all of which risks are hereby assumed by the Company and each Designated
Subsidiary, including, without limitation, any and all risks of the acts or
omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de
facto government or governmental authority (all such acts and omissions, herein
called the "GOVERNMENTAL ACTS"); provided, however, that the Company and each
Designated Subsidiary shall not be required to indemnify NWUSA or any Bank for
(x) any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent,
but only to the extent, caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of
NWUSA (with respect to which, however, NWUSA shall be liable to the other
Banks) or (y) any breach of obligations of NWUSA to other Banks.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
obligations of the Company and each Designated Subsidiary under this Section
2.22 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

(f) In the event that the credit rating of NWUSA is down-graded to 
less than "AA" by Standard & Poor's Corporation or any successor to the rating 
agency business thereof and such down-grading will cause the Company or any 
Designated Subsidiary to incur any additional expense or otherwise be adversely 
affected, the Company or any Designated Subsidiary may replace any L/Cs issued 
by NWUSA with L/Cs issued by National Westminster Bank PLC, any Bank or any 
other bank, in each case with a credit rating of "AA" or better, provided that
any such letter of credit facility, shall not be entitled to the benefits of 
this Agreement, and shall constitute Specified L/C Obligations (to the extent 
provided in the definition thereof) with the effect of reducing the Available 
L/C Commitment (in accordance with the definition thereof).

2.23 SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan 
or fund the L/C participation to be made by it on the date specified therefor 
shall not relieve the other Banks of their respective obligations to make their 
Loans on such date or fund the L/C participations, but no Bank shall be 
responsible for the failure of the other Banks to make Loans or fund the L/C
participations to be made by such other Banks.

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce each Bank to enter into this Agreement and to make the 
Loans and NWUSA to issue L/Cs hereunder, the Company and each Designated
Subsidiary, as applicable, hereby represents and warrants to such Bank that,
except as disclosed in the SEC Reports:

3.1 FINANCIAL CONDITION. The consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 1992 and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for the fiscal year ended on such date, certified by Grant Thornton, copies of
which have heretofore been furnished to each Bank, and the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet and related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and cash flow of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the ending quarter September 30, 1993 present fairly, in
conformity with GAAP, the consolidated financial condition of the Company and

Requirements of Law, including, without limitation, all applicable
Environmental Laws and Regulations, except to the extent that the failure to

adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or the Notes.

principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

3.5 NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Notes and the other documents contemplated hereby, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof, will not violate any

any Lien on any of its or their respective properties pursuant to any
Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation.

3.6 NO LITIGATION.

No litigation, investigation or proceeding, including, without
limitation, any Environmental Proceeding, of or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,

and other statements furnished in writing to the Agent or the Banks by or on

its obligations under this Agreement or the Notes or the ability of any
Guarantor to perform its obligations under any Guaranty. No Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing.

3.11 TAXES. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed or
caused to be filed all material tax returns which to its knowledge are required
to be filed, and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns
or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other
material taxes, fees or other charges which to its knowledge have been imposed

appropriate proceedings diligently pursued and with respect to which reserves
in conformity with GAAP have been provided in its books); no material tax liens

<PAGE> 60
3.12 SUBSIDIARIES. At the date of this Agreement, the Company has
no Subsidiaries except those listed on Schedule IV, and the Company owns
directly or indirectly 100% of the outstanding voting shares of each such
Subsidiary except as disclosed therein.

3.13 OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Except as permitted in subsection 
6.2, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good title in fee simple to 
or valid leasehold interest in all its real property, and good title to all its 
other property, and none of such owned property is subject to any Lien, except 
for the security interest granted pursuant to the Security Indenture and Trust 
Agreement, the Stock Security Agreement and the Company Pledge Agreement.

3.14 ERISA. Except as described on Exhibit H, as it may be updated
from time to time by the Company pursuant to subsection 5.8(c), neither the
Company, nor any Commonly Controlled Entity, is a participating employer in any
Plan in which more than one employer makes contributions as described in
Sections 4063 and 4064 of ERISA, which, together with all other liabilities
described in this subsection, could give rise to a liability which is material.
For purposes of this subsection, a liability is material if it, together with
all other such liabilities described in this subsection, could subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any tax, penalty, or other liabilities
material in relation to the business, operations, property or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as
described on Exhibit H, as it may be updated from time to time, neither the
Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has any contingent liability with
respect to any post-retirement benefit under any employee welfare benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) other than (i) liability for health plan
continuation coverage as described in part 6 of Title 1 of ERISA, (ii)
liability under any severance plan, (iii) liability under plans or programs
required by law, and (iv) disability benefits under any tax-qualified pension
plans in an amount which together with all other liabilities described in this
subsection, could give rise to a liability which is material. Neither the
Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has received any notice from the
PBGC that any of the Single Employer Plans is being involuntary terminated and
no event shall have occurred, and there exists as of the date hereof no
condition or set of circumstances, which present a material risk of the
involuntary termination of any of the Single Employer Plans. Neither the
Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has incurred any liability to the
PBGC which remains outstanding other than the payment of premiums, and there
are no premiums which have become due which are unpaid. Each Single Employer
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so qualified and each trust
related to such plan has been determined to be exempt under Section 501(a) of
the

55
<PAGE> 61
Code, or the period for obtaining such a determination letter has not expired;
and no event has occurred and no condition currently exists which might
reasonably be expected to give rise to a liability that is material as a result
of the failure of any plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code to be so qualified. No Plan is being audited or
investigated by any government agency or subject to any pending or threatened
claim or suit, which audit, investigation, pending claim or suit could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a liability, which together with all
other liabilities described in this subsection would be material. Each Single
Employer Plan currently meets and during the preceding six years has met the
minimum funding standard of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code
(without regard to any funding waiver). With respect to each Multiemployer
Plan, the Company and each Commonly Controlled Entity have paid or accrued to
the extent required by GAAP all contributions pursuant to the terms of each
applicable collective bargaining agreement. No Reportable Event has occurred
during the six-year period prior to the date on which this representation is
made or deemed made with respect to any Single Employer Plan which Reportable
Event, together with all other liabilities described in this subsection, could
give rise to a liability which is material, and each Single Employer Plan has
complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and
the Code. The present value of all benefit liabilities (within the meaning of
Title IV of ERISA) under each Single Employer Plan maintained by the Company or
any Commonly Controlled Entity (based on those assumptions used to fund the
respective Single Employer Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation
date, exceed the value of the assets of such Single Employer Plan allocable to
such benefit liabilities by more than $2,500,000. Neither the Company nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity has any unsatisfied liability with respect to a
complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, which together with
all other liabilities described in this subsection would be material, and, to
the best of the Company's knowledge, the liability to which the Company or any
Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject under ERISA if the Company or
any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all
Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date
hereof would not, together with all other liabilities described in this
subsection, be material. No such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or
Insolvent, where the liability which could reasonably be expected to result is
in an amount in excess of an amount which, taken together with all the
liabilities described in this subsection, is material. Neither the Company nor
any Commonly Controlled Entity is required to provide security to a Single
Employer Plan pursuant to Section 307 of ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has engaged in a
transaction which could reasonably be expected to subject it to liability under
Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA which liability together with all other
liabilities described in this subsection is material. Except as

56
<PAGE> 62
disclosed in Exhibit H, as it may be updated from time to time there are no
agreements which will provide payments to any officer, employee, shareholder or
highly compensated individual which will be parachute payments under Section
280G of the Code that are nondeductible to the Company or any Subsidiary and
which will be subject to the tax under Section 4999 of the Code for which the
Company or any Subsidiary would have a material withholding liability.

3.15 INDENTURES. (a) There have been delivered to the Agent and
each Bank a true and correct copy of each of the Indenture and the Security
Indenture and Trust Agreement, including all amendments, changes, supplements
and other side letters or agreements with respect thereto executed and
delivered by the Company thereunder, and all officer's certificates relating to
the collateral delivered by the Company to the Trustee during the term of the
Security Indenture and Trust Agreement and a list of any and all changes in the
collateral pledged thereunder. To the best of the knowledge of the Company,
the Indenture, the Security Indenture and Trust Agreement and all such other
documents have been duly executed and delivered by the parties thereto and are
in full force and effect at the date hereof. The Security Indenture and Trust
Agreement creates a legal, valid and enforceable and perfected first lien on
and security interest in all of the collateral pledged by the Company
thereunder for the benefit of the creditors of the Company listed on Schedule V
hereto in addition to the Agent and the Banks.

(b) The Obligations under this Agreement in respect of principal
and interest on the Notes constitute "Senior Indebtedness" as defined in the
Indenture and the Security Indenture and Trust Agreement.

3.16 SEC REPORTS. The Company has furnished the Agent with true
copies of the SEC Reports.

3.17 INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries
possesses all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and copyrights,
and rights with respect to the foregoing (collectively, "PATENT RIGHTS"),
necessary to conduct its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted, except for technology not material to the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the best knowledge of the Company,
the Patent Rights do not conflict with the patents, trademarks, service marks,
trade names, and copyrights and rights with respect to the foregoing, of any
other Person except for conflicts which are not material to the operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

3.18 NAME CHANGES, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS. Except as set forth on
Exhibit G, neither the Company nor any of the Material Operating Subsidiaries
has within the six-year period immediately preceding the date of this Agreement
changed its

57
<PAGE> 63
name, been the surviving entity of a merger or consolidation, or acquired all
or substantially all of the assets of any Person.

3.19 LICENSES AND APPROVALS. The Company and each of the 
Subsidiaries has all necessary licenses, permits and governmental
authorizations, including, without limitation, licenses, permits and
authorizations required to comply with all Environmental Laws and Regulations
to own and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for licenses, permits and authorizations, which the failure
to have does not materially adversely affect the operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

3.20 LABOR DISPUTES; COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS; EMPLOYEE
GRIEVANCES. Except as set forth on Exhibit E, there is no pending strike, work
stoppage, material unfair labor practice claim or charge, arbitration or other
material labor dispute against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or
their representative employees.

3.21 SOLVENCY. To the best of the knowledge of the Company, the
Company and each Designated Subsidiary is Solvent and, after giving effect to
the receipt and application of the Loans and the issuance of L/Cs in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the Company and each Designated Subsidiary
shall continue to be Solvent.

3.22 OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS FOR BORROWED MONEY. Schedule III
contains among other items a complete and accurate list of all Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for borrowed money, and all available
committed credit lines, outstanding on the date hereof.

SECTION 8. THE AGENT

8.1 APPOINTMENT. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints National Westminster Bank USA as the Agent for such Bank under this
Agreement, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Guaranties, and each such
Bank irrevocably authorizes National Westminster Bank USA, as Agent for such
Bank, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement,
the Notes, the Security Documents and the Guaranties and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the
terms of this Agreement, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Guaranties,
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

8.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Guaranties by
or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not
be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-
in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

8.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall
be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or
such Person under or in connection with this Agreement, the Notes, the Security
Documents or the Guaranties (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
the Company, or any Subsidiary or any officer thereof contained in this
Agreement, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guaranties or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement, the
Notes, the Security Documents or the Guaranties or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement,
the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guaranties or for any failure of the
Company or any Subsidiary to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
The Agent shall be under no obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire
as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement, the Notes, the Security Documents or the
Guaranties, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Company or
any Subsidiary.

84
<PAGE> 90
8.4 RELIANCE BY AGENT. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, or
teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the
proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Company and any Subsidiary),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent may
deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes
unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall
have been filed with the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing
or refusing to take any action under this Agreement, the Notes, the Security
Documents and the Guaranties unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Required Banks as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or
in refraining from acting, under this Agreement, the Notes, the Security
Documents and the Guaranties in accordance with a request of the Required
Banks, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of the Notes.

8.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank, the Company or any
Subsidiary referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that the notice is a "notice of default". In the event
that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Banks. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required
Banks; provided that unless and until the Agent shall have received such
directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks.

8.6 NON-RELIANCE ON AGENT AND OTHER BANKS. Each Bank expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations
or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including
any review of the affairs of the Company or any Subsidiary, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank
represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appro-

85
<PAGE> 91
priate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company and each Subsidiary and made its own decision to make its Loans
hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to
be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty
or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries which may come into the
possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

8.7 INDEMNIFICATION. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent in
its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company and without
limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably according to the
respective amounts of their Commitments, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any
time (including without limitation at any time following the payment of the
Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes, the Security Documents
or the Guaranties or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Bank shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting solely from the Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the payment of the
Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

8.8 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The Agent and its Affiliates 
may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of 
business with the Company and its Subsidiaries as though the Agent were not the 
Agent hereunder. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note 
issued to it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this 
Agreement as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the 
Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include the Agent in its
individual capacity.

86
<PAGE> 92
8.9 SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may resign as an Agent upon 20 days' 
notice to the Banks. If the Agent shall resign as the Agent under this 
Agreement, then the Required Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a
successor agent for the Banks which successor agent shall be approved by the
Company, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and
duties of the Agent which resigned, and the term "Agent", shall mean such
successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights,
powers and duties as the Agent shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to
this Agreement or any holders of the Notes; provided however, that upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default the approval of
the Company of the successor agent shall not be required hereunder. Upon its
resignation hereunder, each Agent shall execute and deliver any documents
relating to its actions as Agent which may be necessary to permit the successor
agent to act as Agent hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation
hereunder as the Agent, the provisions of this subsection 8.9 shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
the Agent under this Agreement.

8.10 FAILURE TO ACT. Except for action expressly required of the
Agent hereunder, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or
refusing to act hereunder unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by
the Banks against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it
by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

8.11 CO-AGENTS. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Co-Agents
have been designated as such for purposes of convenience only, and that the
Co-Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those which may
be expressly set forth in a written agreement signed by the Co-Agents, or any
fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Co- Agents or any of them.

Company and the Designated Subsidiaries a written instrument waiving, on such
terms and conditions as the Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the

written consent of all of the Banks, or (b) amend, modify or waive any

such change in any provision of Section 8 to be effective prospectively only).

binding upon the parties to this Agreement and all holders of the Notes. In
the case of any waiver, the parties to this Agreement shall be restored to
their former position and rights hereunder and under the outstanding Notes, and

continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

to the benefit of the Banks and the Agent and their respective successors and
assigns. The rights and obligations of the Company and each Designated

all or a portion of its Commitment, the Loans owing to it, and the Note or
Notes held by it); provided, however, that: (i) each such assignment shall be
of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all of the assigning Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) the amount of the Commitment
of the assigning Bank being assigned pursuant to each such assignment
(determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to
such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 and shall be an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 (except, in each case, in connection with the
sale by any Bank of its entire Commitment), and (iii) each such assignment
shall be to an Eligible Assignee which, as a result of such assignment, shall
hold, Commitments of not less than $10,000,000 in the aggregate subject to pro
rata reduction in the event of the reduction of the Commitments pursuant
hereto. Upon the execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after
the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective
date shall be at least three Business Days after the execution thereof: (x)
the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder, and (y)
the Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining
portion of an assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto); provided, however that each

(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Bank assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Bank makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or

value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto; (ii) such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Company and each Designated Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the
Company and each Designated Subsidiary of any of their respective obligations
under this Agree-

92

ment or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of such financial statements and such other documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Bank or any other Bank and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank. The
Company shall not have any liability or obligation under this subsection
9.7(b).

(c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an assigning Bank and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee,
together with any original Note subject to such assignment, the Agent shall
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, and give prompt notice thereof to the
Company. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, each of
the Company and each Designated Subsidiary, at its own expense, shall execute
and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the
order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by
it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Bank has
retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Bank
in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new
Note(s) shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of such surrendered Note, shall be dated the effective date of
such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially in the
form of Exhibit A-1.

(d) The Company and each Designated Subsidiary acknowledges that
any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time: (i) sell to one or more Eligible
Participants participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Note
held by such Bank, any Commitment of such Bank or any other interest of such
Bank hereunder (each a "PARTICIPATING INTEREST"), without in any such case the
need for any approval by the Company, and (ii) subject to the Company's prior
approval in each instance (but only when no Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
sell to one or more banks or other entities that do not, directly or
indirectly, engage in business

93
<PAGE> 99
competitive with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each such
participant and each Eligible Participant is hereinafter referred to
individually as a "PARTICIPANT" and collectively as the "PARTICIPANTS") a
Participating Interest provided, that no Participant (other than an Affiliate
of such Bank which is a Subsidiary of such Bank or the parent holding company
of such Bank or a Subsidiary of such holding company) shall be entitled under
the relevant participation agreement or any associated agreement to require
such Bank to take or omit to take any action hereunder, except, to the extent
that any Participant has any interest directly affected thereby, action that
extends the final maturity of any Loan, reduces the rate or extends the time of
payment of interest on any Loan, extends the time for payment or reduces any
fee payable to such Bank hereunder, or reduces the principal amount of any
Loan. In the event of any such sale by such Bank of participating interests to
a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes
under this Agreement, and the Company shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations
under this Agreement. The Company and each Designated Subsidiary also agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.13,
2.15, 2.16 and 2.22 with respect to its participation in the Commitments, and
the Eurodollar Loans outstanding from time to time; provided, that no
Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such
subsections than the transferor Bank would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Bank
to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

(e) The Company and each Designated Subsidiary authorizes each
Bank to disclose to any Eligible Assignee or Participant or potential Eligible
Assignee or Participant any and all financial information in its possession
concerning the Company and each Designated Subsidiary which has been delivered
to it by the Company and each Designated Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement
or which has been delivered to it by the Company and each Designated Subsidiary
in connection with its credit evaluation of the Company prior to entering into
this Agreement; provided, that the intended recipient first delivers
confidentiality undertakings for the benefit of the Company to the effect of
subsection 9.11 with respect to non-public information.

(f) If, pursuant to subsection 9.7(a) or (b), any interest in this
Agreement, a participation agreement or any Note is transferred to any
Participant or Eligible Assignee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Bank shall cause such Participant or Eligible Assignee concurrently with the
effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to the transferor Bank for the
benefit of the Company and its

94
<PAGE> 100
Subsidiaries that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required
to be withheld by the transferor Bank or the Company or each Designated
Subsidiary with respect to any Loans, (ii) to furnish to the Bank and the
Company either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form 1001 (wherein such Participant claims entitlement to complete
exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder)
and (iii) to agree to provide the transferor Bank a new Form 4224 or Form 1001
upon the obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable
statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and
amendments duly executed and completed by such Participant, and to comply from
time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such
withholding tax exemption.

(g) No person to whom a participation has been granted or who has
received an assignment hereunder may grant any participation or make any
assignment unless such participation or assignment would be permitted under
this subsection 9.7 if made by a Bank.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no assignment
or participation will be permitted if, after giving effect thereto, the
aggregate Commitment of the transferee, together with such transferee's
participating interest in the Commitments, would exceed 25% of the aggregate
Commitments.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Bank may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve
Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System. No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its
obligations hereunder.

9.8 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At any time and from time to time, upon
the request of the Agent, the Company and each Designated Subsidiary shall
execute, deliver and acknowledge or cause to be executed, delivered and
acknowledged, such further documents and instruments and do such other acts and
things as the Agent may reasonably request in order to fully effect the
purposes of this Agreement, the Notes, the Guaranties and the Security
Documents and any other agreements, instruments and documents delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection with the Loans.

9.9 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) If any Bank (a "BENEFITED BANK")
shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of any of its Loans or
interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof or any payment
under any Guaranty (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant
to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in paragraph (f)

95
<PAGE> 101
of Section 7, or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to
and collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other
Bank's Loans, or interest on any of the foregoing, such Benefited Bank shall
purchase for cash from each other Bank such portion of each such other Bank's
Loans, or shall provide each such other Bank with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
Benefited Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with the other Banks; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment or benefits is hereafter recovered from such
Benefited Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The
Company and each Designated Subsidiary agrees that each Bank so purchasing a
portion of any other Bank's Loans may exercise all rights of payment
(including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion
as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such portion. Any payments
received after the Banks have taken action pursuant to this subsection 9.9
shall be allocated ratably among the Credit Loans, the Competitive Bid Loans,
the Swing Line Loans and participations in L/Cs of all the Banks.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of each Bank provided
by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default,
each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the Company or any
Designated Subsidiary, any such notice being expressly waived to the extent
permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply against any indebtedness,
whether matured or unmatured, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such
Bank under this Agreement, the Notes or the Security Documents, any amount
owing from such Bank to the Company or any such Subsidiary at, or at any time
after, the happening of any of the above-mentioned events, and such right of
set-off may be exercised by such Bank against the Company or any such
Subsidiary or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee
for the benefit of creditors, receiver, custodian or execution, judgment or
attachment creditor of the Company or any such Subsidiary or against anyone
else claiming through or against the Company or any such Subsidiary or such
trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor,
notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been
exercised by such Bank prior to the making, filing or issuance, or service upon
such Bank of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for the benefit of
creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or
issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. Each Bank agrees promptly
to notify the Company, any such Subsidiary, the Agent and each other Bank after
any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

96
<PAGE> 102
9.10 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.11 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Bank agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of information designated as confidential and provided to it by
the Company, or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or the
Guaranties; provided, however, that any Bank may disclose such information (a)
at the request of any bank regulatory authority or in connection with an
examination of such Bank by any such authority, (b) pursuant to subpoena or
other court process, (c) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable law, (d) as required by any other Governmental
Authority, (e) to such Bank's independent auditors, attorneys or other
professional advisors upon receipt of a confidentiality undertaking for the
benefit of the Company in conformity with this subsection 9.11 as to non-public
information or (f) to any Eligible Assignee or Participant or potential
Eligible Assignee or Participant; provided that such Eligible Assignee or
Participant, as the case may be, agrees in writing to maintain the
confidentiality of such information in conformity with this subsection 9.11.

9.12 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more
of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts and all
of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with the Company, the Designated Subsidiaries and the
Agent.

February 24, 1994

[Letterhead]

To the Banks
on the Attached Schedule

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as general counsel for Ply Gem Industries, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and each of the Designated
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of (i) the
Credit Agreement, dated February __, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement"), among
the Company, the Designated Subsidiaries, the banks parties to the Credit
Agreement (collectively, the "Banks"), and National Westminster Bank USA,
as agent (in such capacity, the "Agent"), (ii) the Credit Notes, (iii) the
Swing Line Notes, (iv) the Designated Subsidiary Acquisition Notes, (v)
the Guaranties, (vi) the Stock Security Agreement, and (vii) the Company
Pledge Agreement.

The Credit Notes, the Swing Line Notes, and the Designated
Subsidiary Acquisition Notes are herein collectively called the "Notes".
The Security Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Security Indenture"), the
Stock Security Agreement and the Company Pledge Agreement are herein
collectively called the "Security Documents". All other terms used herein
which are defined in the Credit Agreement shall have their respective
meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement unless otherwise defined
herein. This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to subsection 4.1(f) of
the Credit Agreement.

In connection with this opinion, We have examined (i) executed
copies of each of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the Guaranties, the
Security Documents, the Indenture dated as of October 1, 1988, as amended,
between the Company and the Bank of Montreal Trust Company as trustee (the
"Indenture"), (ii) the form of Competitive Bid Note, and (iii) such
corporate documents and records of the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries, certificates of public officials and officers of the Company
and each of the Subsidiaries and such other documents as I have deemed
necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In stating my
opinion, I have assumed the genuineness 
<PAGE> 156

Page 2 February 24, 1994

of the signature of, and the authority of, the person signing the Credit
Agreement on behalf of each of the Banks and the Agent, the authenticity
of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to
authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as
certified, conformed or photostatic copies.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (i) is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, (ii) has the corporate power and
authority and the legal right to own and operate its property, to lease
the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it
is currently engaged and (iii) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation
and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where
qualification is required by the nature of its business or the character
and location of its property or business and in which the failure to so
qualify could have a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
property or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

2. The Company (i) has the corporate power and authority (a)
to execute and deliver the Credit Note to be executed and delivered by it
(the "Parent Note"), (b) to execute, deliver and perform the Credit
Agreement and the Guaranty to be executed and delivered by it (the "Parent
Guaranty"), and each of the Security Documents and each document
contemplated thereby, and (c) to borrow under the Credit Agreement, (ii)
has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize (a) the borrowing
under the Credit Agreement, (b) the execution and delivery of the Parent
Note, and (c) the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit
Agreement, the Parent Guaranty, each of the Security Documents and each
document contemplated thereby. No consent or approval of any Person
(including without limitation the stockholders of the Company), no consent
or approval of any landlord or mortgagee, no waiver of consent, license,
approval, authorization or declaration of any Governmental Authority or
filing with any Governmental Authority is or will be required in
connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or
enforceability of the Credit Agreement, the Parent Note, the Parent
Guaranty, any of the Security Documents or any document contemplated
thereby.

3. Each of the Designated Subsidiaries (i) has the corporate
power and authority (a) to execute and deliver each of the Notes (each
such Note, a "Subsidiary Note") and the Competitive Bid Note, if any, to
be executed and delivered by it, (b) to execute, deliver and perform the
Credit Agreement and (c) 

<PAGE> 157

Page 3 February 24, 1994

to borrow under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) has taken all necessary
corporate action to authorize (a) the borrowing under the Credit
Agreement, (b) the execution and delivery of each Subsidiary Note and the
Competitive Bid Note, if any, to be executed and delivered by it, and (c)
the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement. Each
Subsidiary which has executed a Guaranty (collectively, the "Subsidiary
Guaranties") has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform such Guaranty, and has taken all necessary corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of such Guaranty. No
consent or approval of any Person (including without limitation the
Company), no consent or approval of any landlord or mortgagee, no waiver
of consent, license, approval, authorization or declaration of any
Governmental Authority or filing with any Governmental Authority is or
will be required in connection with the execution delivery, performance,
validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, the Subsidiary Notes,
any Competitive Bid Notes or the Subsidiary Guaranties.

4. The Credit Agreement, the Parent Note, the Parent
Guaranty, each of the Security Documents and each document contemplated to
be delivered thereby has been duly executed and delivered, and constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its respective terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or
at law).

5. The Credit Agreement, each of the Subsidiary Notes, and
each of the Subsidiary Guaranties has been duly executed and delivered,
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Subsidiary
party thereto enforceable against such Subsidiary in accordance with its
respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

6. Assuming due execution and delivery, each of the
Competitive Bid Notes, will be the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Subsidiary party thereto enforceable against such Subsidiary in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general 

<PAGE> 158

Page 4 February 24, 1994

principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

7. The execution and delivery of the Parent Note and each
Subsidiary Note, and each Competitive Bid Note, if any, and the execution,
delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement, the Guaranties, each of
the Security Documents, and each document contemplated thereby, the
borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the use of the proceeds thereof
as provided in the Credit Agreement, as of the date hereof, will not
violate any Requirement of Law, including without limitation, the
provisions of Regulation G, T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, violate any Contractual Obligation or create (with
or without the giving of notice or passing of time or both) a default
under any material agreement, bond, note, or indenture to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound or any of its
properties or assets is affected, or result win the imposition of any
lien, charge, encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the
properties or assets owned by or used in connection with the business of
the Company or any subsidiary except for the liens and security interests
created and granted to the Agent pursuant to the Security Documents.

8. To the best of our knowledge after due inquiry, no
litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority is pending or threatened by or against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or against any of its or their respective
properties or revenues (i) with respect to the Credit Agreement, the
Notes, the Guaranties, the Security Documents, any document contemplated
to be delivered thereby, or any of the transactions contemplated by any
such documents, or (ii) which, if adversely determined, would have a
material adverse effect on the business, operations, property or financial
or other condition of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries taken,as a
whole.

9. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an "investment
company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

10. At the date hereof the Company has no Subsidiaries
except those listed on Schedule IV to the Credit Agreement, and the
Company or the Subsidiary therein specified owns directly 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of each such Subsidiary, free and clear of any
Lien other than the Lien created by the Security Documents. All of the
shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and
issued, and are fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights.

<PAGE> 159

Page 5 February 24, 1994

11. Each of the Security Indenture, the Stock Security
Agreement and the Company Pledge Agreement creates a legal, valid and
enforceable security interest in all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of, with respect to (i) The Security Indenture, the
Existing Pledged Subsidiaries, (ii) The Stock Security Agreement, the
Newly Pledged Subsidiaries, and (iii) the Company Pledge Agreement, the
Existing Pledged Subsidiaries and the Newly Pledged Subsidiaries (such
shares of capital stock being herein collectively called the "Pledged
Securities"). Pursuant to the Security Documents, the Pledged Securities
are pledged by the Company in favor of the Agent as security for the
payment, observance and performance by the Company of the Obligations
including, without limitation, the Guaranteed Obligations as defined and
provided for in the Parent Guarantee. Assuming possession by the Agent of
the Pledged Securities, the security interests created by the Security
Indenture and the Stock Security Agreement are first priority security
interests in the Pledged Securities subject to no prior or equal lien and
based upon our knowledge at this time, the security interests created by
the Company Pledge Agreement are subject only to the aforementioned
security interests. Based upon my knowledge at this time, upon
termination of the Stock Security Agreement and the Security Indenture,
the security interest created by the Company Pledge Agreement will be a
first priority security interest in the Pledged Securities, subject to no
prior or equal Lien.

12. The Agent has been duly appointed "successor trustee"
under the Security Indenture which appointment is effective not later than
the date hereof.

13. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement
constitute "Senior Indebtedness" as defined in the Indenture and the
Security Indenture.

We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and do not
purport to be an expert in, or to express any opinion concerning the laws
of, any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Federal laws of
the United States and General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Elihu Modlin

To the Banks
on the Attached Schedule

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to National Westminster Bank USA in its
capacity as Agent and as a Bank under the Credit Agreement hereinafter
referred to. You have asked for this opinion in connection with the
execution and delivery of (i) the Credit Agreement, dated February __,
1994 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Ply Gem Industries, Inc., the
Designated Subsidiaries, the banks parties to the Credit Agreement
(collectively, the "Banks"), and National Westminster Bank USA, as agent
(in such capacity, the "Agent"), (ii) the Credit Notes, (iii) the Swing
Line Notes, (iv) the Designated Subsidiary Acquisition Notes, (v) the
Guaranties, (vi) the Stock Security Agreement, and (vii) the Company
Pledge Agreement.

The Company and each of the Designated Subsidiaries are herein
collectively called the "Borrowers". The Credit Notes, the Swing Line
Notes, and the Designated Subsidiary Acquisition Notes are herein
collectively called the "Notes". The Security Indenture and Trust
Agreement is hereinafter called the "Security Indenture". The Stock
Security Agreement and the Company Pledge Agreement are herein
collectively called the "Security Documents". The Credit Agreement, the
Notes, the Guaranties, and the Security Documents are herein collectively
called the "Loan Documents". All other terms used herein which are
defined in the Credit Agreement shall have their respective meanings set
forth in the Credit Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.

As counsel to the Agent, we have prepared certain of the Loan
Documents, including, without limitation, (a) the Credit Agreement, (b)
the Notes, including the form of Competitive Bid Note, (c) the Guaranties,
and (d) the Security Documents. We have also reviewed (i) a certified
copy of the articles of incorporation and all amendments thereto for the
Borrowers and each of the Guarantors, (ii) a certified copy of the
resolutions of each of the Borrowers and each of the Guarantors
authorizing such party to execute and deliver the documents and
instruments referred to therein, (iii) an incumbency certificate for the
officers of each of the Borrowers and each of the Guarantors, (iv)
certificates of good standing for each of the Borrowers and each of the
Guarantors, 

<PAGE> 163

To the Banks on the
Attached Schedule
February __, 1992

(v) by-laws for each of the Borrowers and each of the Guarantors, (vi) a
fully executed counterpart of the Credit Agreement, (vii) the executed
Notes, (viii) a fully executed copy of each Security Document, (ix) a copy
of the Security Indenture, (x) a fully executed copy of each Guaranty, and
(xi) the opinion of counsel for the Borrowers and each of the Guarantors.
We have also reviewed such other documents and such matters of law as we
have deemed necessary and appropriate in order to render this opinion.

In making such review, we have assumed the authenticity of all
documents; delivered to us as certified copies of the original, the
genuineness of all signatures, the authority of each officer executing the
Credit Agreement on behalf of each Bank and the Agent and the conformity
of all photocopies of documents to the originals thereof.

For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed, with your
approval, and without independent investigation, the following:

A. Each of the Loan Documents and the Security Indenture has
been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by the party or parties
thereto;

B. All statements of fact in all representations and
warranties set forth in each of the Loan Documents, the Security Indenture
and in all certificates delivered by or on behalf of any Borrower or
Guarantor at the Closing, and the opinion of Elihu H. Modlin, Esq.
delivered at the Closing, are correct and complete;

C. The proceeds of the initial Loans (none of which shall
have been advanced at the Closing) will be applied for the purposes set
forth in, and not in violation of the provisions of, the Credit Agreement,
and the Loans will be valid and binding obligations of the Borrowers with
respect thereto; and

D. The Company has good, sufficient and marketable title to
the collateral covered by the Security Documents and the Security
Indenture, free and clear of all charges, liens, security interests,
encumbrances or adverse claims of any kind, except for the Liens granted
to the Agent and Liens permitted to exist under the Credit Agreement.

On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the
qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

-2-
<PAGE> 164
To the Banks on the
Attached Schedule
February __, 1992

1. The Agent, acting on behalf of itself and the Banks, is
in receipt of all documents the delivery of which (unless waived by the
Agent) was a condition precedent to the obligations of the Banks to make
the Loans, and of National Westminster Bank USA to issue the L/Cs, under
and pursuant to the Credit Agreement.

2. The Credit Agreement, the Notes, including the
Competitive Bid Notes, if any, the Guaranties and the Security Documents,
when duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement, will be the valid and binding obligations of each
Borrower and/or Guarantor party thereto, under New York Law, enforceable
in accordance with their respective terms, except that we express no
opinion as to:

(a) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction (other
than the State of New York) in which any Bank may be located
which limits rates of interest and other fees which may be
charged or collected by such Bank;

(b) the right, title or interest of the Company or
any other Person in or to any collateral in which any security
interests, liens or pledges are or are purported to be granted by
or under any of the Security Documents or the Security Indenture;

(c) the perfection or priority of any such security
interest referred to in clause (b) above;

(d) the availability of the remedy of specific
performance to the extent it is subject to judicial discretion;

(e) the validity, binding effect or enforceability
under certain circumstances, of contractual provisions in the
Loan Documents and the Security Indenture (i) waiving defenses to
obligations where such waivers are against public policy, and
(ii) waiving broadly or vaguely stated rights or unknown future
rights;

(f) the penultimate sentence of Section 9.9 of the
Credit Agreement;

(g) the application of judicial decisions invoking
statutes or principles of equity which have held that certain
covenants and other provisions or agreements, including those
providing for the acceleration of indebtedness due under debt

-3-
<PAGE> 165
To the Banks on the
Attached Schedule
February __, 1992

instruments upon the occurrence of events therein described, are
unenforceable in circumstances where it cannot be demonstrated
that the enforcement of such provisions is reasonably necessary
for the protection of the lender;

(h) the enforceability, under certain circumstances,
of provisions imposing penalties or forfeitures or providing for
late payment charges or increases in applicable interest rates
upon default;

(i) the enforceability, under certain circumstances,
of provisions relating to self-help or summary remedies without
notice or opportunity for hearing or correction;

(j) whether the proceeds of the collateral covered
by the Security Documents and the Security Indenture will be
subject to the limitations on the enforceability of a security
interest in proceeds set forth in Section 9-306 of the UCC;

(k) the validity, binding effect, or enforceability,
under certain circumstances, of provisions that rights or
remedies are not exclusive, that "reasonable" attorneys' fees are
collectible without court approval, that every right or remedy is
cumulative and may be exercised, in addition to or with any other
right or remedy, or that the election of some particular remedy
or remedies does not preclude recourse to one or more others,
including, without limitation, the right to obtain a deficiency
judgment against the Borrowers or the Guarantors;

(1) the negotiability of any of the Notes;

(m) the effect, if any, of any Federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance,
moratorium or other similar law now or hereafter in effect,
affecting the rights of creditors generally;

(n) the effect on enforceability of the
application of general principles of equity, or laws and judicial
decisions affecting the remedies provided in the Security
Documents and the Security Indenture for the enforcement of the
security interest in the collateral provided for therein;

(o) whether or not any of the Borrowers or any of
the Guarantors is "insolvent" or will be rendered "insolvent" by
the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement or any of

-4-
<PAGE> 166
To the Banks on the
Attached Schedule
February __, 1992

the Guaranties, or the creation of the liens and security
interests provided for in the Security Documents, as the term
"insolvent" is used in Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code or in
the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act as enacted in New York; and

(p) the validity of any collateral security obtained
at security for any obligations hereafter incurred by the
Borrowers to you which obligations are not incurred under and
