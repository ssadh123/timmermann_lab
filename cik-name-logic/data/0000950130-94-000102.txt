issued at the same time, then the documents required to be delivered pursuant to
this Section 3.03(b) must be delivered only once, prior to the authentication
and delivery of the first Debt Security of such series; provided however, that
---------------- 
any subsequent request by the Company to the Trustee to authenticate Debt
Securities of such series upon original issuance shall constitute a

Indenture.

(f) Each Debt Security shall be dated the date of its authentication,
except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt
Securities of such series.

unless there appears on such Debt Security a certificate of authentication
substantially in one of the forms provided for herein duly executed by the
Trustee or by an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of one of its
authorized officers, and such certificate upon any Debt Security shall be
conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Debt Security (and any
Coupons appertaining thereto) has been duly authenticated and delivered
hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Except as
permitted by Section 3.05, 3.06 or 3.07, the Trustee shall not authenticate and
deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant Coupons then matured have
been detached and canceled.

SECTION 3.04. Temporary Debt Securities. Pending the preparation of
-------------------------- 
definitive Debt Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon
Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Debt
Securities that are
<PAGE>

25

printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any
authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Debt
Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if
authorized, in bearer form with one or more Coupons or without Coupons, and with
such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as
the officers executing such Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, may determine,
as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Debt Securities and
Coupons. Any such temporary Debt Security may be in global form, representing
all or a portion of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series. Every such
temporary Debt Security shall be executed by the Company and shall be
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in
substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Debt
Security or Securities in lieu of which it is issued.

If temporary Debt Securities of any series are issued, the Company
will cause definitive Debt Securities of such series to be prepared without
unreasonable delay. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section
3.01(13)(z) with respect to a series of Debt Securities issuable as Bearer
Securities or as one or more Global Securities representing individual Bearer
Securities of the series, (a) after the preparation of definitive Debt
Securities of such series, the temporary Debt Securities of such series shall be
exchangeable for definitive Debt Securities of such series upon surrender of the
temporary Debt Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company
in a Place of Payment for such series, without charge to the Holder, except as
provided in Section 3.05 in connection with a transfer and except that a Person
receiving definitive Bearer Securities shall bear the cost of insurance,
postage, transportation and the like unless otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 3.01, and (b) upon surrender for cancelation of any one or more
temporary Debt Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons
appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of
definitive Debt Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of
like tenor; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be
-------- ------- 
delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security and; provided further
----------------
that delivery of a Global Security representing individual Bearer Securities or
a Bearer Security shall occur only outside the United States. Until so
exchanged, temporary Debt Securities of any series shall in all respects be
entitled to the same benefits
<PAGE>

26

under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities of such series, except as
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01(13)(y) with respect to the
payment of interest on Global Securities in temporary form.

Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, the Company will
execute and deliver each definitive Global Security representing individual
Bearer Securities and each Bearer Security to the Trustee at its principal
office in London or such other place outside the United States specified
pursuant to Section 3.01.

Upon any exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security for a
definitive Global Security or for the individual Debt Securities represented
thereby pursuant to this Section 3.04 or Section 3.05, the temporary Global
Security shall be endorsed by the Trustee to reflect the reduction of the
principal amount evidenced thereby, whereupon the principal amount of such
temporary Global Security shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so
exchanged and endorsed.

SECTION 3.05. Registration, Transfer and Exchange. (a) The Company
------------------------------------ 
shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register
for each series of Registered Securities (the registers maintained in such
office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment
being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company
shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers and
exchanges of Registered Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security
Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and registering
transfers and exchanges of Registered Securities as herein provided; provided,
-------- 
however, that the Company may appoint co-Security Registrars. Such Security
- ------- 
Register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being
converted into written form within a reasonable period of time. At all
reasonable times the Security Register shall be open for inspection by the
Company.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security
of any series at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such
purpose, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent
shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee, one or
<PAGE>

27

more new Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denomination
or denominations of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Except as
otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, in no event may Registered
Securities, including Registered Securities received in exchange for Bearer
Securities, be exchanged for Bearer Securities.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until
it is exchanged in whole or in part for the individual Debt Securities
represented thereby, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Debt
Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the
Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of
such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by
such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or
a nominee of such successor Depositary.

At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series
(other than a Global Security, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for
other Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denomination or
denominations of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of
the Registered Securities to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company
maintained for such purpose.

At the option of the Holder, except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 3.01(11) or 3.01(13) with respect to a Global Security
representing Bearer Securities, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged
for Registered Securities (if the Debt Securities of such series are issuable as
Registered Securities) or Bearer Securities of the same series, of any
authorized denomination or denominations, of like tenor and aggregate principal
amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at the office or
agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, with all unmatured Coupons
and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining; provided, however, that
-------- -------
delivery of a Bearer Security shall occur only outside the United States. If
the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon
or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be
effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable
to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such
missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons
may be waived by the
<PAGE>

28

Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity
as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If
thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying
Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been
made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment;
provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.07, interest
- -------- ------- 
represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of
those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States.

Whenever any Debt Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Debt
Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exchange of Bearer Securities for
Registered Securities will be subject to the provisions of United States income
tax laws and regulations applicable to Debt Securities in effect at the time of
such exchange.

(b) If at any time the Depositary for the Debt Securities of a series
notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary
for the Debt Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the
Debt Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section
3.03(d), the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the
Debt Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Debt
Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after
the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the
Company's election pursuant to Section 3.01(11) shall no longer be effective
with respect to the Debt Securities of such series and the Company will execute,
and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and
delivery of individual Debt Securities of such series, will authenticate and
deliver, individual Debt Securities of such series in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities
representing Debt Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security
or Securities.

The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that
individual Debt Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more
Global Securities shall no longer be
<PAGE>

29

represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company
will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of individual Debt Securities of such series, will
authenticate and deliver, individual Debt Securities of such series in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security
or Securities representing Debt Securities of such series in exchange for such
Global Security or Securities.

If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to a
series of Debt Securities, the Depositary for such series of Debt Securities may
surrender a Global Security for such series of Debt Securities in exchange in
whole or in part for individual Debt Securities of such series on such terms as
are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,

(i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new individual Debt
Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination
as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in
exchange for such Persons' beneficial interest in the Global Security; and

(ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal
to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered
Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of individual Debt
Securities delivered to Holders thereof.

In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs,
the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver
individual Debt Securities (a) in registered form in authorized denominations,
if the Debt Securities of such series are issuable as Registered Securities, (b)
in bearer form in authorized denominations, with or without Coupons attached, if
the Debt Securities of such series are issuable as Bearer Securities or (c) as
either Registered or Bearer Securities, if the Debt Securities of such series
are issuable in either form; provided, however, that individual Bearer
-------- ------- 
Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a Global Security only in
accordance with the procedures specified pursuant to Section 3.01.
<PAGE>

30

Upon the exchange of a Global Security for individual Debt Securities,
such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Individual Registered
Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section
shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the
Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or
indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee
shall deliver such Registered Securities to the Persons in whose names such
Registered Securities are so registered. The Trustee shall deliver individual
Bearer Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this
Section to the Persons and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary
for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect
participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
individual Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a Global
Security only in accordance with the procedures as may be specified pursuant to
Section 3.01.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exchange of Bearer Securities for
Registered Securities will be subject to the provisions of United States income
tax laws and regulations applicable to Debt Securities in effect at the time of
such exchange.

(c) All Debt Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Debt
Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debt Securities
surrendered for such transfer or exchange.

Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for transfer or
exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Security
Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and the Security
Registrar, duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized
in writing.

No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of Debt
Securities except as provided in Section 3.04(b) or 3.06. The Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration, transfer or
exchange of Debt Securities, other than those expressly provided in this
Indenture
<PAGE>

31

to be made at the Company's own expense or without expense or without charge to
the Holders.

The Company shall not be required (i) to register, transfer or
exchange Debt Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening
of business 15 days before the day of the transmission of a notice of redemption
of Debt Securities of such series selected for redemption under Section 13.04
and ending at the close of business on the day of such transmission, or (ii) to
register, transfer or exchange any Debt Security so selected for redemption in
whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Debt Security being
redeemed in part; provided, however, that, if specified pursuant to Section
-------- ------- 
3.01, any Bearer Securities of any series that are exchangeable for Registered
Securities and that are called for redemption pursuant to Section 13.02 may, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, be exchanged for one or more Registered
Securities of such series during the period preceding the Redemption Date.

SECTION 3.06. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Debt Securities.
------------------------------------------------------ 
If (i) any mutilated Debt Security or any mutilated Coupon with the Coupon
Security to which it appertains (and all unmatured Coupons attached thereto) is
surrendered to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office (in the case of
Registered Securities) or at its principal London office (in the case of Bearer
Securities) or (ii) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Debt Security or any
Coupon, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any Paying Agent
harmless, and neither the Company nor the Trustee receives notice that such Debt
Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, then the Company
shall execute and upon Company Request the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Debt Security or in exchange for the Coupon Security to which such
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, a new Debt Security of
the same series of like tenor, form, terms and principal amount, bearing a
number not contemporaneously Outstanding, and, in the case of a Coupon Security,
with such Coupons attached thereto that neither gain nor loss in interest shall
result from such exchange or substitution.
<PAGE>

32

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or
Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Debt Security, pay the amount due on
such Debt Security or Coupon in accordance with its terms; provided, however,
-------- ------- 
that payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on Bearer
Securities or Coupons shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.07, be
payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States.

Upon the issuance of any new Debt Security under this Section, the
Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in respect thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

Every new Debt Security of any series, with its Coupons, if any,
issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or
stolen Debt Security or Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and
shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities of that series and their
Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities or Coupons.

SECTION 3.07. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved. (a)
----------------------------------------------- 
Interest on any Registered Security that is payable and is punctually paid or
duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in
whose name such Registered Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest
notwithstanding the cancelation of such Registered Security upon any transfer or
exchange subsequent to the Regular Record Date. In case a Coupon Security of
any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series
after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for
such series) on any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business (at
such office or agency) on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Coupon
Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest
<PAGE>

33

Payment Date and interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in
respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Coupon Security,
but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance
with the provisions of this Indenture. Payment of interest on Registered
Securities shall be made at the Corporate Trust Office (except as otherwise
specified pursuant to Section 3.01) or, at the option of the Company, by check
mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall
appear in the Security Register or, if provided pursuant to Section 3.01 and in
accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, at the option of the
Registered Holder by wire transfer to an account designated by the Registered
Holder.

(b) Interest on any Coupon Security that is payable and is punctually
paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the
Holder of the Coupon that has matured on such Interest Payment Date upon
surrender of such Coupon on such Interest Payment Date at the principal London
office of the Trustee or at such other Place of Payment outside the United
States specified pursuant to Section 3.01.

Interest on any Bearer Security (other than a Coupon Security) that is
payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date
shall be paid to the Holder of the Bearer Security upon presentation of such
Bearer Security and notation thereon on such Interest Payment Date at the
principal London office of the Trustee or at such other Place of Payment outside
the United States specified pursuant to Section 3.01.

Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, at the direction
of the Holder of any Bearer Security or Coupon payable in Dollars, and subject
to applicable laws and regulations, payments in respect of such Bearer Security
or Coupon will be made by check drawn on a bank in The City of New York or, in
accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, by wire transfer to a
Dollar account maintained by such Holder with a bank outside the United States.
If such payment at the offices of all Paying Agents outside the United States
becomes illegal or is effectively precluded because of the imposition of
exchange controls or similar restrictions on the full payment or receipt of such
amounts in Dollars, the Company will appoint an office or agent in the United
States at which such payment may be made. Unless otherwise specified pursuant
to Section 3.01, at the direction of the Holder of any Bearer
<PAGE>

34

Security or Coupon payable in a Foreign Currency, payment on such Bearer
Security or Coupon will be made by a check drawn on a bank outside the United
States or, in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee, by wire
transfer to an appropriate account maintained by such Holder outside the United
States. Except as provided in this paragraph, no payment on any Bearer Security
or Coupon will be made by mail to an address in the United States or by transfer
to an account maintained by the Holder thereof in the United States.

(c) Any interest on any Debt Security that is payable but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called
"Defaulted Interest") shall, if such Debt Security is a Registered Security,
forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder on the relevant Regular
Record Date by virtue of his having been such a Registered Holder, and such
Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as
provided in clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest
to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business
on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which
shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the
Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid
on each such Registered Security and the date of the proposed payment, and
at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of
money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such
Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when
deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to
such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee
shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest
which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the
date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by
the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall
promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name
and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed
payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to
be mailed, first-class postage
<PAGE>

35

prepaid, to the Holders of such Registered Securities at their addresses as
they appear in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such
Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as
aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose
names such Registered Securities (or their respective Predecessor
Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record
Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
In case a Coupon Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a
Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an
office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Special
Record Date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency)
on the related proposed date of payment of Defaulted Interest, such Coupon
Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such proposed
date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not be payable on such proposed
date of payment in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange
for such Coupon Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such
Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on
Registered Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the
requirements of any securities exchange on which such Registered Securities
may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange,
if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed
payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed
practicable by the Trustee.

(d) Any Defaulted Interest payable in respect of Bearer Securities of
any series shall be payable pursuant to such procedures as may be satisfactory
to the Trustee in such manner that there is no discrimination between the
Holders of Registered Securities (if any) and Bearer Securities of such series,
and notice of the payment date therefor shall be given by the Trustee, in the
name and at the expense of the Company, in the manner provided in Section 1.05
not more than 25 days and not less than 20 days prior to the date of the
proposed payment.

(e) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Debt
Security delivered under this Indenture upon
<PAGE>

36

transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security shall carry
the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by
such other Debt Security.

SECTION 3.08. Cancelation. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to
------------ 
Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series, all Debt Securities surrendered
for payment, redemption, transfer, exchange or credit against any sinking fund
and all Coupons surrendered for payment or exchange shall, if surrendered to any
Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly
canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for
cancelation any Debt Securities or Coupons previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
and all Debt Securities or Coupons so delivered shall be promptly canceled by
the Trustee. No Debt Securities or Coupons shall be authenticated in lieu of or
in exchange for any Debt Securities or Coupons canceled as provided in this
Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Debt
Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee shall be returned to the Company.
The acquisition of any Debt Securities or Coupons by the Company shall not
operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented thereby
unless and until such Debt Securities or Coupons are surrendered to the Trustee
for cancelation.

SECTION 3.09. Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise specified
------------------------ 
pursuant to Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series, interest on the Debt
Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months.

SECTION 3.10. Currency of Payments in Respect of Debt Securities.
--------------------------------------------------- 
(a) Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Bearer
Securities of any series, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest on Bearer Securities of such series denominated in any Currency will be
made in such Currency.

(b) Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for
Registered Securities of any series, payment of the principal of (and premium,
if any) and interest on Registered Securities of such series will be made in
Dollars.

(c) For purposes of any provision of the Indenture
<PAGE>

37

where the Holders of Outstanding Debt Securities may perform an Act that
requires that a specified percentage of the Outstanding Debt Securities of all
series perform such Act and for purposes of any decision or determination by the
Trustee of amounts due and unpaid for the principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest on the Debt Securities of all series in respect of which moneys are to
be disbursed ratably, the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
Outstanding Debt Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency will be the amount
in Dollars based upon exchange rates, determined as specified pursuant to
Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of such series, as of the date for determining
whether the Holders entitled to perform such Act have performed it or as of the
date of such decision or determination by the Trustee, as the case may be.

(d) Any decision or determination to be made regarding exchange rates
shall be made by an agent appointed by the Company; provided that such agent
-------- 
shall accept such appointment in writing and the terms of such appointment
shall, in the opinion of the Company at the time of such appointment, require
such agent to make such determination by a method consistent with the method
provided pursuant to Section 3.01 for the making of such decision or
determination. All decisions and determinations of such agent regarding
exchange rates shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the
Company, the Trustee and all Holders of the Debt Securities.

SECTION 3.11. Judgments. The Company may provide pursuant to Section
---------- 
3.01 for Debt Securities of any series that (a) the obligation, if any, of the
Company to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt
Securities of any series in a Foreign Currency or Dollars (the "Designated
Currency") as may be specified pursuant to Section 3.01 is of the essence and
agrees that, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, judgments in
respect of such Debt Securities shall be given in the Designated Currency; (b)
the obligation of the Company to make payments in the Designated Currency of the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Debt Securities shall,
notwithstanding any payment in any other Currency (whether pursuant to a
judgment or otherwise), be discharged only to the extent of the amount in the
Designated Currency that the Holder receiving such payment may, in accordance
with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other
Currency (after any premium and cost of
<PAGE>

38

exchange) on the business day in the country of issue of the Designated Currency
or in the international banking community (in the case of a composite currency)
immediately following the day on which such Holder receives such payment; (c) if
the amount in the Designated Currency that may be so purchased for any reason
falls short of the amount originally due, the Company shall pay such additional
amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such shortfall; and (d) any
obligation of the Company not discharged by such payment shall be due as a
separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein,
shall continue in full force and effect.

SECTION 3.12. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities
------------- 
may use "CUSIP" numbers, (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee
shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders;
provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
- -------- 
correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Debt Securities or as
contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on
the other identification numbers printed on the Debt Securities, and any such
redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

ARTICLE IV

Satisfaction and Discharge
--------------------------

SECTION 4.01. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This
---------------------------------------- 
Indenture, with respect to the Debt Securities of any series (if all series
issued under this Indenture are not to be affected), shall, upon Company
Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of
registration of transfer or exchange of such Debt Securities herein expressly
provided for and rights to receive payments of principal of (and premium, if
any) and interest on such Debt Securities and any right to receive additional
interest as provided in Section 1202) and the Trustee, at the expense of the
Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture, when:

(1) either

(A) all Debt Securities and the Coupons, if any, of such series
theretofore authenticated and delivered
<PAGE>

39

(other than (i) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities of such
series surrendered in exchange for Registered Securities of such
series and maturing after such exchange, surrender of which is not
required or has been waived as provided in Section 3.05, (ii) Debt
Securities and Coupons of such series that have been destroyed, lost
or stolen and that have been replaced or paid as provided in Section
3.06, (iii) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities of such series
called for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date,
surrender of which has been waived as provided in Section 11.07 and
(iv) Debt Securities and Coupons of such series for whose payment
money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held
in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or
discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 12.04) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancelation; or

(B) all Debt Securities and the Coupons, if any, of such series
not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancelation,

(i) have become due and payable, or

(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year, or

(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,

and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for

to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Debt Securities for
principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the
case of Debt Securities and Coupons that have become due and payable) or to the
Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; provided, however, in
-------- ------- 
the event a petition for relief under the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or
hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or state
<PAGE>

40

bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, is filed with respect to the
Company within 91 days after the deposit and the Trustee is required to return

the Company under this Indenture with respect to such Debt Securities shall not
be deemed terminated or discharged;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
hereunder by the Company; and

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent herein
provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture
with respect to such series have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the
obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.07 and, if money shall
have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of
this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.02 and the last

determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, or the principal (and premium, if
any) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the
Trustee.

SECTION 4.03. Indemnity. The Company shall pay and indemnify the
----------

with Section 4.01 and termination of the Company's obligations under this
Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities and Coupons of such series.

------------------ 
herein with respect to Debt Securities of any series means any one of the

shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law, pursuant
to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation
of any administrative or governmental body):

(1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Debt Security of
such series or any payment with respect to the related Coupons, if any,

period of 30 days; or

(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any,

(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as

(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty
of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a
default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section
specifically dealt with or which expressly has been included in this
Indenture solely for the benefit of Debt Securities of a series other than
such series) or established in or pursuant to the Board Resolution or
supplemental indenture, as the case may be, pursuant to which the Debt
Securities of such series were issued as contemplated by Section 3.01, and
continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there
has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the
Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in

or
<PAGE>

42

(5) the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the
Company by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary
case under the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or
any other applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian,
trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any
substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation
of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed
and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or

(6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case under the
Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other
applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or
the consent by it to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary
case under any such law or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator,
assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of
the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it
of an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or the admission by it
in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due,
or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any
action; or

(7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Debt
Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.01.

SECTION 5.02. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If
--------------------------------------------------- 
an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series at the time
Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of Outstanding Debt Securities
of such series may declare the principal amount (or, if any Debt Securities of
such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of
such Discount Securities as may be specified in the terms of such Discount
Securities) of and all accrued but unpaid interest on all the Debt Securities of
such series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the
Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration
such principal amount (or specified amount) and interest shall become
immediately due and payable. Upon payment of such amounts in the Currency in
which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as otherwise provided
pursuant
<PAGE>

43

to Section 3.01), all obligations of the Company in respect of the payment of
principal of and interest on the Debt Securities of such series shall terminate.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Debt Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Debt Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and
the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum in the
Currency in which such Debt Securities are denominated (except as otherwise
provided pursuant to Section 3.01) sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue installments of interest on all Debt Securities
of such series or all overdue payments with respect to any related
Coupons,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debt
Securities of such series that have become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Debt Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue installments of interest on each Debt Security
or upon overdue payments on any Coupons at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Debt Securities or Coupons, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel; provided, however, that all sums
-------- ------- 
payable under this clause (D) shall be paid in Dollars;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Debt Securities of such
series, other than the nonpayment of principal of and interest on Debt
Securities of such series
<PAGE>

44

that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been
cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.

No such rescission and waiver shall affect any subsequent default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

For all purposes under this Indenture, if a portion of the principal
of any Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and
payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such
declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the
principal amount of such Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes
hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and
payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the
principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration,
together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder,
shall constitute payment in full of such Discount Securities.

SECTION 5.03. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by
-------------------------------------------------------
Trustee. The Company covenants that if:
- -------- 

(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on
any Debt Security or any payment with respect to any Coupons when such
interest or payment becomes due and payable and such default continues for
a period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any, on) any Debt Security at the Maturity thereof,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Debt Securities or of such Coupons, the amount then due and
payable on such Debt Securities or matured Coupons, for the principal (and
premium, if any) and interest, if any, and interest upon the overdue principal
(and premium, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be
legally enforceable, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Debt Securities or Coupons; and, in addition
thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
<PAGE>

45

counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand,
the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities and Coupons,
and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided
by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt
Securities and Coupons wherever situated.

If an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect
and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities and
Coupons of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee
shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in
aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper
remedy.

SECTION 5.04. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
--------------------------------- 
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceedings, or any voluntary or involuntary case under the Federal bankruptcy
laws, as now or hereafter constituted, relative to the Company or any other
obligor upon the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of a particular series or
the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the
Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of such Debt Securities shall
then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration of acceleration
or otherwise; and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand
on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and
premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Debt
Securities and Coupons of such series and to file such other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable
<PAGE>

46

compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
agents and counsel) and of the Holders of such Debt Securities and Coupons
allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian, liquidator, sequestrator (or
other similar official) in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each such
Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Holders, to pay to
the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize
or consent to or accept or adopt, on behalf of any Holder any plan or
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Debt
Securities or any Coupons of such series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or
to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any
such proceeding.

SECTION 5.05. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Debt
-----------------------------------------------------
Securities or Coupons. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or
- ---------------------- 
the Debt Securities and the Coupons, if any, of any series may be prosecuted and
enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Debt Securities or
Coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any
such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name, as
trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision
for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of
the Holders of the Debt Securities or Coupons in respect of which such judgment
has been recovered.

SECTION 5.06. Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by
------------------------------- 
the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at
the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such
money on account
<PAGE>

47

of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Debt
Securities or Coupons of any series in respect of which money has been collected
and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon
surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section
6.07;

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities or
Coupons of such series, in respect of which or for the benefit of which
such money has been collected ratably, without preference or priority of
any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Debt Securities
or Coupons for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively;
and

THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons entitled
thereto.

SECTION 5.07. Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Debt Security or
-------------------- 
Coupon of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial
or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a
receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of
a continuing Event of Default with respect to such series;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Debt Securities of such series shall have made written request
to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default
in its own name as Trustee hereunder;

(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in
compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request
and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
<PAGE>

48

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given
to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such
Holders or of the Holders of Outstanding Debt Securities or Coupons of any other
series, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other
of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the
manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such
Holders. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section
5.07, each and every Holder of Debt Securities or Coupons of any series and the
Trustee for such series shall be entitled to such relief as can be given at law
or in equity.

SECTION 5.08. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal,
----------------------------------------------------
Premium and Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture,
- --------------------- 
the Holder of any Debt Security or of any Coupon shall have the right, which is
absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium,
if any) and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on the respective Stated Maturity
or Maturities expressed in such Debt Security or Coupon (or, in the case of
redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of
any such payment and interest thereon, and such right shall not be impaired
without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 5.09. Restoration of Right and Remedies. If the Trustee or
---------------------------------- 
any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under
this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any
reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then
and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject
to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively
to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of
the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been
instituted.
<PAGE>

49

SECTION 5.10. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise
------------------------------- 
expressly provided elsewhere in this Indenture, no right or remedy herein
conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 5.11. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of
----------------------------- 
the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any
Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of
any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy
given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be
exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the
Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

SECTION 5.12. Control by Holders. The Holders of a majority in
------------------- 
principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series shall have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of such series; provided that
-------- 

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
with this Indenture;

(2) subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, the Trustee shall have
the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good
faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the
Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would be unjustly
prejudicial to the Holders of Debt Securities of such series not joining in
any such direction; and

(3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee
that is not inconsistent with such direction.
<PAGE>

50

SECTION 5.13. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than
------------------------ 
a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series
may on behalf of the Holders of all the Debt Securities of any such series and
any related Coupons waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series
and its consequences, except a default

(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest on any Debt Security of such series or in the payment of any
related Coupon, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that under Article
Eleven cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Debt Security of such series affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of the Debt Securities of such series under this Indenture, but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

SECTION 5.14. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture
---------------------- 
agree, and each Holder of any Debt Security or any Coupon by his acceptance
thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion
require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its
discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and
good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant, but the
provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder or group of Holders holding in the
aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities
of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of a Debt Security or
Coupon for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any) or interest on such Debt Security or the payment of such Coupon on or after
the respective Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Debt Security or
Coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
<PAGE>

51

SECTION 5.15. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company
--------------------------------- 
covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any
time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the
benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at
any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of
this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so)
hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants
that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such
power as though no such law had been enacted.

to Debt Securities of any series, except during the continuance of an Event of
Default with respect to the Debt Securities of such series,

(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties
as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants
or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to
the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in
the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions
hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the
Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or
not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

(b) In case an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of
any series has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall, with respect to
the Debt Securities of such
<PAGE>

52

series, exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture,
and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that
------ 

(1) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of
subsection (a) of this Section;

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in
good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the

for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture; and

(4) the Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds
or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its
duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it
shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured
to it.

(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of
this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section.

SECTION 6.02. Notice of Defaults. Within 90 days after the
------------------- 
occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to Debt Securities or Coupons,
if any, of any series the Trustee shall by the pertinent methods provided in
Section 1.05 give
<PAGE>

53

notice to all Holders of Debt Securities and Coupons of such series of each
default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been
cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of default in the
-------- ------- 
payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Debt
Security or Coupon of such series or in the payment of any sinking fund
installment with respect to Debt Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be
protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors,
the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible
Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such
notice is in the interest of the Holders of Debt Securities and of Coupons of
such series; and provided further that in the case of any default of the
---------------- 
character specified in Section 5.01(4) with respect to Debt Securities of such
series no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the
occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means
any event that is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an
Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities or Coupons of such series.

SECTION 6.03. Certain Rights of Trustee. Except as otherwise

<PAGE>

(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction

reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and
liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or
direction;

(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the
facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,

SECTION 6.05. May Hold Debt Securities or Coupons. The Trustee, any
------------------------------------ 
Paying Agent, the Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company or the
Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or
pledgee of Debt Securities or Coupons, and, subject to Sections 6.08 and 6.13,
may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.

SECTION 6.06. Money Held in Trust. Money in any Currency held by the

------------------------------- 

(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation in
Dollars for all services rendered by it hereunder as may be mutually agreed
upon in writing by the Company and the Trustee (which compensation shall
not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a
trustee of an express trust);

(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
Trustee in Dollars upon its request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance
with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation
and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any
such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its
negligence or bad faith; and

(3) to indemnify in Dollars the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad
faith on its part; arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of this trust or performance of its duties hereunder,
including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or
liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its
powers or duties hereunder.
<PAGE>

As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company
under this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to the Debt Securities
and Coupons, if any, upon all property and funds held or collected by the
Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the payment of amounts due on
the Debt Securities and Coupons.

The obligations of the Company under this Section 6.07 to compensate
and indemnify the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall
constitute additional indebtedness under this Indenture and shall survive the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

SECTION 6.08. Disqualification; Conflicting Interests. (a) The
---------------------------------------- 
Trustee shall comply with TIA (S)310(b); provided, however, that there shall be
-------- ------- 
excluded from the operation of TIA (S)310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures
under under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation
in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such
exclusion set forth in TIA (S)310(b)(1) are met.

(b) If Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act is amended at any
time after the date of this Indenture to change the circumstances under which a
Trustee shall be deemed to have a conflicting interest with respect to the Debt
Securities of any series or to change any of the definitions in connection
therewith, this Section 6.08 shall be automatically amended to incorporate such
changes.

SECTION 6.09. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. There shall
---------------------------------------- 
at all times be a Trustee hereunder that shall be a corporation organized and
doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof
or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000,
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority and having
its Corporate Trust Office or an agency in New York, New York; provided,
-------- 
however, that if Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act or the rules and
- ------- 
regulations of the Commission under the Trust Indenture Act at any time permit a
corporation organized and doing business under the laws of any other
jurisdiction to serve as trustee of an indenture qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act, this Section 6.09 shall be automatically amended to permit a
corporation
<PAGE>

57

organized and doing business under the laws of any such other jurisdiction to
serve as Trustee hereunder. If such corporation publishes reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the
combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition
so published. The Trustee shall comply with Section 310(a)(5) of the Trust
Indenture Act. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in
the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

SECTION 6.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. (a)
-------------------------------------------------- 
No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor
Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 6.11.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Debt
Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the
Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have
been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt
Securities of such series.

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Debt
Securities of any series and a successor Trustee appointed by Act of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such
series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.

(d) If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.08(a) with
respect to the Debt Securities of any series after written request
therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder of a Debt Security of such series for at least six months, or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.09
with respect to the Debt Securities of any series and shall fail to
resign after written request
<PAGE>

58

therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or a decree or
order for relief by a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall
have been entered in respect of the Trustee in an involuntary case
under the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or
any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar law; or a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in
the premises shall have been entered for the appointment of a
receiver, custodian, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or
other similar official) of the Trustee or of its property or affairs,
or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or
of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation, winding up or liquidation, or

(4) the Trustee shall commence a voluntary case under the Federal
bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other
applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or
shall consent to the appointment of or taking possession by a
receiver, custodian, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or
other similar official) of the Trustee or its property or affairs, or
shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit
in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become
due, or shall take corporate action in furtherance of any such action,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the
Trustee with respect to all Debt Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 5.14,
any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Debt Security of any series for
at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and
the appointment of a successor Trustee for the Debt Securities of such series.

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with
respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board
Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect
to
<PAGE>

59

the Debt Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such
successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Debt Securities of one or
more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee
with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series) and shall comply
with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year after
such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a
successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any series shall be
appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Debt Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the
retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its
acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee with respect to the
Debt Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor
Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the
Debt Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the
Holders of such series and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter
provided, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Debt Security of such
series for at least six months may, subject to Section 5.14, on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt
Securities of such series.

(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each
removal of the Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any series and
each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of
any series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 1.05 to the
Holders of Debt Securities of such series. Each notice shall include the name
of the successor Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of such series and
the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

SECTION 6.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. (a) In the
--------------------------------------- 
case of an appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Debt
Securities, each such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting
such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring
Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of the Company or the
successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of
<PAGE>

60

its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor
Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall
duly assign, transfer and deliver, such successor Trustee all property and money
held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if
any, provided for Section 6.07.

(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Debt Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company,
the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Debt
Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture
supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment
and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable
to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such
successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with
respect to all Debt Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed
necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties
of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those
series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be
vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the
provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate
the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being
understood that nothing herein or in any such supplemental indenture shall
constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such
Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from
any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon
the execution and delivery of any such supplemental indenture the resignation or
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided
therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties
of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those
series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on
request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall
duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Debt
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of
<PAGE>

61

such successor Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the
time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible
under this Article.

SECTION 6.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to
--------------------------------------------------
Business. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
- --------- 
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder;
provided that such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under
this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Debt Securities shall have
been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any
successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee
may adopt such authentication and deliver the Debt Securities so authenticated
with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such
Debt Securities. In case any Debt Securities shall not have been authenticated
by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and
deliver such Debt Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor
Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the
certificate of authentication of the Trustee.

SECTION 6.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. (a)
--------------------------------------------------
Subject to subsection (b) of this Section, if the Trustee shall be or shall
become a creditor, directly or indirectly, secured or unsecured, of the Company
within three months prior to a default, as defined in subsection (c) of this
Section, or subsequent to such default, then, unless and until such default
shall be cured, the Trustee shall set apart and hold in a special account for
the benefit of the Trustee individually,
<PAGE>

62

the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the Coupons, if any, and the holders
of other indenture securities (as defined in subsection (c) of this Section):

(1) an amount equal to any and all reductions in the amount due and
owing upon any claim as such creditor in respect of principal and interest,
effected after the beginning of such three-month period and valid as
against the Company and its other creditors, except any such reduction
resulting from the receipt or disposition of any property described in
paragraph (2) of this subsection, or from the exercise of any right of set-
off which the Trustee could have exercised if a voluntary or involuntary
case had been commenced in respect of the Company under the Federal
bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable
Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law upon the date
of such default; and

(2) all property received by the Trustee in respect of any claim as
such creditor, either as security therefor, or in satisfaction or
composition thereof, or otherwise, after the beginning of such three-month
period, or an amount equal to the proceeds of any such property, if
disposed of, subject, however, to the rights, if any, of the Company and
------- ------- 
its other creditors in such property or such proceeds.

Nothing herein contained, however, shall affect the right of the Trustee:

(A) to retain for its own account (i) payments made on account of any
such claim by any Person (other than the Company) who is liable thereon,
and (ii) the proceeds of the bona fide sale of any such claim by the
Trustee to a third Person, and (iii) distributions made in cash, securities
or other property in respect of claims filed against the Company in
bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to
the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other
applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law;

(B) to realize, for its own account, upon any property held by it as
security for any such claim, if such property was so held prior to the
beginning of such three-month period;
<PAGE>

63

(C) to realize, for its own account, but only to the extent of the 
claim hereinafter mentioned, upon any property held by it as security for
any such claim, if such claim was created after the beginning of such
three-month period and such property was received as security therefor
simultaneously with the creation thereof, and if the Trustee shall sustain
the burden of proving that at the time such property was so received the
Trustee has no reasonable cause to believe that a default would occur
within three months; or

(D) to receive payment on any claim referred to in paragraph (B) or
(C), against the release of any property held as security for such claim as
provided in paragraph (B) or (C), as the case may be, to the extent of the
fair value of such property.

For the purposes of paragraphs (B), (C) and (D), property substituted
after the beginning of such three-month period for property held as security at
the time of such substitution shall, to the extent of the fair value of the
property released, have the same status as the property released, and, to the
extent that any claim referred to in any of such paragraphs is created in
renewal of or in substitution for or for the purpose of repaying or refunding
any preexisting claim of the Trustee as such creditor, such claim shall have the
same status as such preexisting claim.

If the Trustee shall be required to account, the funds and property
held in such special account and the proceeds thereof shall be apportioned among
the Trustee, the Holders and the holders of other indenture securities in such
manner that the Trustee, the Holders and the holders of other indenture
securities realize, as a result of payments from such special account and
payments of dividends on claims filed against the Company in bankruptcy or
receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Federal
bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable
Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, the same
percentage of their respective claims, figured before crediting to the claim of
the Trustee anything on account of the receipt by it from the Company of the
funds and property in such special account and before crediting to the
respective claims of the Trustee and the Holders and the holders of other
indenture securities dividends on claims filed against the Company in bankruptcy
or receivership
<PAGE>

64

or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Federal bankruptcy laws, as
now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or State
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, but after crediting thereon
receipts on account of the indebtedness represented by their respective claims
from all sources other than from such dividends and from the funds and property
so held in such special account. As used in this paragraph, with respect to any
claim, the term "dividends" shall include any distribution with respect to such
claim, in bankruptcy or receivership or proceedings for reorganization pursuant
to the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other
applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, whether
such distribution is made in cash, securities, or other property, but shall not
include any such distribution with respect to the secured portion, if any, of
such claim. The court in which such bankruptcy, receivership or proceedings for
reorganization is pending shall have jurisdiction (i) to apportion among the
Trustee and the Holders and the holders of other indenture securities, in
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the funds and property held in
such special account and proceeds thereof, or (ii) in lieu of such
apportionment, in whole or in part, to give to the provisions of this paragraph
due consideration in determining the fairness of the distributions to be made to
the Trustee and the Holders and the holders of other indenture securities with
respect to their respective claims, in which event it shall not be necessary to
liquidate or to appraise the value of any securities or other property held in
such special account or as security for any such claim, or to make a specific
allocation of such distributions as between the secured and unsecured portions
of such claim, or otherwise to apply the provisions of this paragraph as a
mathematical formula.

Any Trustee that has resigned or been removed after the beginning of
such three-month period shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection as
though such resignation or removal had not occurred. If any Trustee has
resigned or been removed prior to the beginning of such three-month period, it
shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection if and only if the
following conditions exist:

(i) the receipt of property or reduction of claim, which would have
given rise to the obligation to account, if such Trustee had continued as
Trustee, occurred after the beginning of such three-month period; and
<PAGE>

65

(ii) such receipt of property or reduction of claim occurred within three
months after such resignation or removal.

(b) There shall be excluded from the operation of subsection (a) of
this Section a creditor relationship arising from

(1) the ownership or acquisition of securities issued under any
indenture, or any security or securities having a maturity of one year or
more at the time of acquisition by the Trustee;

(2) advances authorized by a receivership or bankruptcy court of
competent jurisdiction or by this Indenture, for the purpose of preserving
any property that shall at any time be subject to the lien of this
Indenture or of discharging tax liens or other prior liens or encumbrances
thereon, if notice of such advances and of the circumstances surrounding
the making thereof is given to the Holders at the time and in the manner
provided in this Indenture;

(3) disbursements made in the ordinary course of business in the
capacity of trustee under an indenture, transfer agent, registrar,
custodian, paying agent, fiscal agent or depositary, or other similar
capacity;

(4) an indebtedness created as a result of services rendered or
premises rented; or an indebtedness created as a result of goods or
securities sold in a cash transaction as defined in subsection (c) of this
Section;

(5) the ownership of stock or of other securities of a corporation
organized under the provisions of Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act,
as amended, which is directly or indirectly a creditor of the Company; or

(6) the acquisition, ownership, acceptance or negotiation of any
drafts, bills of exchange, acceptances or obligations which fall within the
classification of self-liquidating paper as defined in subsection (c) of
this Section.

(c) For the purposes of this Section only:
<PAGE>

66

(1) The term "default" means any failure to make payment in full of
the principal of or interest on any of the Debt Securities or upon the
other indenture securities when and as such principal or interest becomes
due and payable.

(2) The term "other indenture securities" means securities upon which
the Company is an obligor outstanding under any other indenture (i) under
which the Trustee is also trustee, (ii) which contains provisions
substantially similar to the provisions of this Section, and (iii) under
which a default exists at the time of the apportionment of the funds and
property held in such special account.

(3) The term "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full
payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after
delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other
orders drawn upon banks and payable upon demand.

(4) The term "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of
exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or
incurred by the Company for the purpose of financing the purchase,
processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or
merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to,
possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the
receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or
merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is
received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor
relationship with the Company arising from the making, drawing, negotiating
or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.

(5) The term "Company" means any obligor upon the Debt Securities.

SECTION 6.14. Appointment of Authenticating Agent. As long as any
------------------------------------ 
Debt Securities of a series remain Outstanding, the Trustee may, by an
instrument in writing, appoint an authenticating agent (the "Authenticating
Agent") which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to
authenticate Debt Securities issued upon exchange, registration of transfer,
partial redemption or pursuant to Section 3.06. Debt Securities
<PAGE>

67

of each such series authenticated by such Authenticating Agent shall be entitled
to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all
purposes as if authenticated by such Trustee. Wherever reference is made in
this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities of any
series by the Trustee for such series or to the Trustee's Certificate of
Authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and
delivery on behalf of the Trustee for such series by an Authenticating Agent for
such series and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf of such
Trustee by such Authenticating Agent. Such Authenticating Agent shall at all
times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$10,000,000 (determined as provided in Section 6.09 with respect to the Trustee)
and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority.

Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency business
of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to the Authenticating Agent with
respect to all series of Debt Securities for which it served as Authenticating
Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of the Trustee for such series or such Authenticating Agent. Any
Authenticating Agent may at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible
shall, resign by giving written notice of resignation to the applicable Trustee
and to the Company.

Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a
termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14 with respect to
one or more of all series of Debt Securities, the Trustee for such series shall
upon Company Request appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, and the Company
shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders of Debt Securities of
such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 1.05. Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its
predecessor hereunder, with like effect
<PAGE>

68

as if originally named as Authenticating Agent. The Company agrees to pay to
the Authenticating Agent for such series from time to time reasonable
compensation for its services. The Authenticating Agent for the Debt Securities
of any series shall have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by
it as such at the direction of the Trustee for such series.

ARTICLE VII

Holders' Lists and Reports by Trustee and Company
-------------------------------------------------

SECTION 7.01. Company to Furnish Trustee Names and Addresses of
-------------------------------------------------
Holders. The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee with
- -------- 
respect to Registered Securities of each series for which it acts as Trustee:

(a) semiannually on June 30 and December 31 of each year, a list, in
such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses
of the Registered Holders as of June 15 or December 15, respectively; and

(b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within
30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of
similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the
time such list is furnished;

provided, however, that if and so long as the Trustee shall be the Security
- -------- ------- 
Registrar, no such list need be furnished.

The Company shall also be required to furnish to the Trustee at all
such times set forth above all information in the possession or control of the
Company or any of its Paying Agents other than the Trustee as to the names and
addresses of the Holders of Bearer Securities of all series; provided, however,
-------- ------- 
that the Company shall have no obligation to investigate any matter relating to
any Holders of Bearer Securities or Coupons, if any, of any series.

SECTION 7.02. Preservation of Information; Communication to Holders.
------------------------------------------------------ 
(a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of Holders contained
in the most recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 7.01,
received by it in the capacity of Paying Agent or Security
<PAGE>

69

Registrar (if so acting) hereunder, and filed with it within the two preceding
years pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(2).

The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in
Section 7.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished, destroy any information
received by it as Paying Agent or Security Registrar (if so acting) hereunder
upon delivering to itself as Trustee, not earlier than 45 days after an Interest
Payment Date, a list containing the names and addresses of the Holders obtained
from such information since the delivery of the next previous list, if any,
destroy any list delivered to itself as Trustee which was compiled from
information received by it as Paying Agent or Security Registrar (if so acting)
hereunder upon the receipt of a new list so delivered, and destroy not earlier
than two years after filing, any information filed with it pursuant to Section
7.03(c)(2).

(b) If three or more Holders (hereinafter referred to as
"applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee
reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Debt Security for a period
of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such
application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders
of Debt Securities of a particular series (in which case the applicants must
hold Debt Securities of such series) or with all Holders of Debt Securities with
respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Debt Securities and is
accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such
applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business
Days after the receipt of such application, at its election either

(i) afford such applicants access to the information preserved at the
time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), or

(ii) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders of
Debt Securities of such series or of all Debt Securities, as the case may
be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the
time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), and as to the
approximate cost of mailing to such Holders the form of proxy, or other
communication, specified in such application.
<PAGE>

70

If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to
such information, the Trustee shall, upon written request of such applicants,
mail to the Holders of Debt Securities of such series or all Holders, as the
case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at
the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), a copy of the form
of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with
reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed
and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of
mailing, unless within five days after such tender the Trustee shall mail to
such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the
material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of
the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders
of Debt Securities of such series or all Holders, as the case may be, or would
be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the
basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon
the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order
refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order
sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have

ARTICLE VIII

Concerning the Holders
----------------------

SECTION 8.01. Acts of Holders. Any request, demand, authorization,
---------------- 
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to
be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or
by an agent or proxy duly appointed in writing, and, except as herein otherwise
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly
required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action
embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the
"Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Whenever in this
Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate
principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series may take any
Act, the fact that the Holders of such specified percentage have joined therein
may be evidenced (a) by the instrument or instruments executed by Holders in
person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by the record of
Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of such Holders duly called and
held in accordance with the provisions of Article IX, or (c) by a combination of
such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Holders.

SECTION 8.02. Proof of Ownership; Proof of Execution of Instruments
-----------------------------------------------------
by Holders. The ownership of Registered Securities of any series shall be
- ----------- 
proved by the Security Register for such series or by a certificate of the
Security Registrar for such series.

The ownership of Bearer Securities shall be proved by production of
such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed by any bank or trust
company, which certificate shall be dated and shall state on the date thereof a
Bearer Security bearing a specified identifying number or other mark was
deposited with or
<PAGE>

73

exhibited to the person executing such certificate by the person named in such
certificate, or by any other proof of possession reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee. The holding by the person named in any such certificate of any Bearer
Security specified therein shall be presumed to continue for a period of one
year unless at the time of determination of such holding (1) another certificate
bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security shall be
produced, (2) such Bearer Security shall be produced by some other Person, (3)
such Bearer Security shall have been registered on the Security Register, if,
pursuant to Section 3.01, such Bearer Security can be so registered, or (4) such
Bearer Security shall have been canceled or paid.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 6.01, 6.03 and 9.05, proof of
the execution of a writing appointing an agent or proxy and of the execution of
any instrument by a Holder or his agent or proxy shall be sufficient and
conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company if made in the following
manner:

The fact and date of the execution by any such person of any
instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other
officer authorized to take acknowledgment of deeds, that the person executing
such instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of
a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such
officer. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association
or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or
partnership, as the case may be, or by any other person acting in a
representative capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute
sufficient proof of his authority.

The record of any Holders' meeting shall be proved in the manner
provided in Section 9.06.

The Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to
any of the matters referred to in this Section so long as the request is a
reasonable one.

If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Debt Securities of
any series any Act, the Company may, at its option, by Board Resolution, fix in
advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Registered Securities
entitled to take such Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so.
<PAGE>

74

Any such record date shall be fixed at the Company's discretion. If such a
record date is fixed, such Act may be sought or given before or after the record
date, but only the Holders of Registered Securities of record at the close of
business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Registered
Securities for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite
proportion of Outstanding Debt Securities of such series have authorized or
agreed or consented to such Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Registered
Securities of such series shall be computed as of such record date.

SECTION 8.03. Persons Deemed Owners. The Company, the Trustee and
---------------------- 
any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any
Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for
the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and
(subject to Section 3.07) interest, if any, on, such Registered Security and for
all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be
overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or
the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company, the
Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder of any
Bearer Security or of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Bearer Security
or Coupon for the purposes of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof
and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Bearer Security or
Coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the
Company or any Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All
payments made to any Holder, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the
extent of the sum or sums paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability
for moneys payable upon such Debt Security or Coupon.

None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security
Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

SECTION 8.04. Revocation of Consents; Future Holders Bound. At any
--------------------------------------------- 
time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in
Section 8.01, of the taking of any Act by the Holders of the percentage in
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities specified in this
<PAGE>

75

Indenture in connection with such Act, any Holder of a Debt Security the number,
letter or other distinguishing symbol of which is shown by the evidence to be
included in the Debt Securities the Holders of which have consented to such Act
may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office and
upon proof of ownership as provided in Section 8.02, revoke such Act so far as
it concerns such Debt Security. Except as aforesaid, any such Act taken by the
Holder of any Debt Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and
upon all future Holders of such Debt Security and all past, present and future
Holders of Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto and of any Debt Securities and
Coupons issued on transfer or in lieu thereof or in exchange or substitution
therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made
upon such Debt Security or Coupons or such other Debt Securities or Coupons.

---------------------------- 
series may at any time call a meeting of Holders of such series to take any
action specified in Section 9.01, to be held at such time or times and at such
place or places as the Trustee for such series shall determine. Notice of every
meeting of the Holders of any series, setting forth the time and place of such
meeting and in general terms the action proposed to be taken at such meeting,
shall be given to Holders of such series in the manner and to the extent
provided in Section 1.05. Such notice shall be given not less than 20 days or
more than 90 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting.

SECTION 9.03. Call of Meetings by Company or Holders. In case at any
--------------------------------------- 
time the Company, pursuant to a Board Resolution, or the Holders of at least 10%
in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of a series or

series to call a meeting of Holders of any or all such series by written request
setting forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the
meeting, and the Trustee shall not have given the notice of such meeting within
20 days after the receipt of such request, then the Company or such Holders may
determine the time or times and the place or places for such meetings and may
call such meetings to take any action authorized in Section 9.01, by giving
notice thereof as provided in Section 9.02.

inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and
other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the
conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate.

The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary
chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the
Company or by Holders of such series as provided in Section 9.03, in which case
the Company or the Holders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in

Subject to the provisos in the definition of "Outstanding", at any
meeting each Holder of a Debt Security of the series with respect to which such
meeting is being held or proxy therefor shall be entitled to vote in such manner
so that whether the specified percentage required for any Act has been voted may
be calculated by the inspectors; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast
--------- ------- 
or counted at any meeting in respect of any Debt Security challenged as not
Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding. The
chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote other than by virtue of
Outstanding Debt Securities of such series held by him or instruments in writing
duly designating him as the person to vote on behalf of Holders of Debt
Securities of such series. Any meeting of Holders with respect to which a

meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the
secretary of the meeting their verified written reports in duplicate of all
votes cast at the meeting. A record in duplicate of the proceedings of
<PAGE>

78

there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of
votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons
having knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting
and showing that said notice was transmitted as provided in Section 9.02. The
record shall show the serial numbers of the Debt Securities voting in favor of
or against any resolution. The record shall be signed and verified by the
affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one of the
duplicates shall be delivered to the Company and the other to the Trustee to be
preserved by the Trustee.

Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the
matters therein stated.

or rights conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to any Holder under any

than the amount provided in such Bearer Security or Coupon to be then due
payable. However, the Company will not be required to make any such payment of
additional interest for or on account of:

(a) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not
have been imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former
connection between such Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor or

or business or present therein or having or having had a permanent

(b) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal
property tax or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(c) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not
have been imposed but for the presentation by the Holder of a Bearer
Security or Coupon for payment more than 15 days after the date on which
such payment became due and payable or on which payment thereof was duly
provided for, whichever occurs later;

(d) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable
otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on a Bearer

nor shall additional interest be paid with respect to a payment on a Bearer
Security or Coupon to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than
the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor
with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to the additional interest had such
beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of such Bearer
Security or Coupon.

Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Debt
Security or payment with respect to any Coupon of any series, such mention shall
be deemed to include mention of the payment of additional interest provided for
in the terms of such Debt Securities and this Section to the extent that, in
such context, additional interest is, was or would be payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this Section and express mention of the payment of
additional interest (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be
construed as excluding additional interest in those provisions hereof where such
express mention is not made.

If the payment of additional interest becomes required in respect of
the Debt Securities of a series, at least ten days prior to the first Interest
Payment Date with respect to which such additional interest will be payable (or
if the Debt Securities of that series will not bear interest prior to Maturity,
the first day on which a payment of principal (and premium, if any) is made and
on which such additional interest will be payable), and at least ten days prior
to each date of payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest if there
has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned
Officers' Certificate, the Company will furnish the Trustee and each Paying
Agent with an Officers' Certificate that shall specify by country the amount, if
any, required to be withheld on such payments to Holders of Debt Securities or
Coupons that are United States Aliens, and the Company will pay to the Trustee
or such Paying Agent the additional interest, if any, required by the terms of
such Debt Securities and this Section. The Company covenants to indemnify the
Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss,
liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence or bad faith on
their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any
of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this
Section 12.02.
<PAGE>

SECTION 12.03. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company will
-------------------------------- 
maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Debt Securities and Coupons,
if any, an office or agency where Debt Securities and Coupons of such series
(but, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.07, unless such Place of Payment
is located outside the United States, not Bearer Securities or Coupons) may be
presented or surrendered for payment, where Debt Securities of such series may
be surrendered for transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon
the Company in respect of the Debt Securities and Coupons of such series and
this Indenture may be served. So long as any Bearer Securities of any series
remain outstanding, the Company will maintain for such purposes one or more
offices or agencies outside the United States in such city or cities specified
pursuant to Section 3.01 and, if any Bearer Securities are listed on a
securities exchange that requires an office or agency for the payment of
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on such Bearer Securities in a
location other than the location of an office or agency specified pursuant to
Section 3.01, the Company will maintain for such purposes an office or agency in
such location so long as any Bearer Securities are listed on such securities
exchange and such exchange so requires. The Company will give prompt written
notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such
office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such
required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address
thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or
served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee (in the case of Registered
Securities) and at the principal London office of the Trustee (in the case of
Bearer Securities), and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to
receive all presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

The Company may also from time to time designate different or
additional offices or agencies to be maintained for such purposes (in or outside
of such Place of Payment), and may from time to time rescind any such
designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall
-------- ------- 
in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations described in the preceding
paragraph. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any
such additional designation or rescission of designation and any change in the
location of any such different or additional office or agency.
<PAGE>

89

SECTION 12.04. Money for Debt Securities; Payments To Be Held in
-------------------------------------------------
Trust. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with
- ------ 
respect to any series of Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, it will, on or
before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on
any of the Debt Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal
(and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid
to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly
notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents with respect
to any series of Debt Securities and Coupons it will, prior to each due date of
the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Securities of such
series, deposit with any such Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal
(and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust
for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless any such Paying
Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action
or failure so to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent with respect to any series of
Debt Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an
instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to
the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and
premium, if any) or interest on Debt Securities of such series and the
payment of any related Coupons in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise
disposed of as herein provided;

(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any
other obligor upon the Debt Securities of such series) in the making of any
payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Debt
Securities of such series or any payment on any related Coupons; and

(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so
held in trust by such Paying
<PAGE>

90

Agent.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent, and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee,
such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to
such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held
by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if
any) or interest on any Debt Security of any series or the payment of any
related Coupon and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and
premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the
Company upon Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be
discharged from such trust, and the Holder of such Debt Security or Coupon shall
thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for
payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee
thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such
-------- -------- 
Paying Agent before being required to make any such repayment, may at the
expense of the Company cause to be transmitted in the manner and to the extent
provided by Section 1.05, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that,
after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the
date of such notification, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining
will be repaid to the Company.

SECTION 12.05. Limitation on Liens. The Company will not, and will
-------------------- 
not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or
suffer to exist any indebtedness for borrowed money (indebtedness for borrowed
money being hereinafter in this Section called "debt") if such debt is secured
by a pledge of, lien on, or security interest in any shares of stock of any
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such stock is now owned or shall hereafter be
acquired, without effectively providing that the Debt Securities of each series
shall be secured equally and ratably with such debt.
<PAGE>

91

SECTION 12.06. Officers' Certificate as to Default.
------------------------------------ 
The Company will deliver to the Trustee, on or before a date not more than four
months after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (which on the date
hereof is the calendar year) ending after the date hereof, an Officers'
Certificate (one of the signers of which shall be the principal executive,
principal financial or principal accounting officer of the Company), stating
whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in
default in the performance and observation of any of the terms, provisions and
conditions of this Indenture, and, if the Company shall be in default,
specifying all such defaults and the nature thereof of which they may have
knowledge. Such compliance shall be determined without regard to periods of
grace or notice requirements.

The Company will deliver written notice to the Trustee promptly after
any officer of the Company has knowledge of the occurrence of any event that
with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both would become an Event of
Default under Clause (4) of Section 5.01.

SECTION 12.07. Waiver of Certain Covenants. The Company may omit in
---------------------------- 
any particular instance to comply, if so provided pursuant to Section 3.01, with
any covenant specified pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt
Securities of any series if, before the time for such compliance, the Holders of
at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of
such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such
instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant, but no such waiver
shall extend to or affect such covenant except to the extent so expressly waived
and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company
and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such covenant shall remain in
full force and effect.

ARTICLE XIII

Redemption of Debt Securities
-----------------------------

SECTION 13.01. Applicability of Article. Debt Securities of any
------------------------- 
series that are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in
accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
<PAGE>

92

SECTION 13.02. Tax Redemption; Special Tax Redemption. (a) Unless
--------------------------------------- 
otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, Bearer Securities of any series
may be redeemed at the option of the Company in whole, but not in part, at any
time, on giving not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice in accordance with
Section 13.05 (which notice shall be irrevocable), at the Redemption Price
thereof (calculated without premium), if the Company has or will become
obligated to pay additional interest on such Bearer Securities pursuant to
Section 12.02 as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any
regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or any change in
the application or official interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings,
which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the date on which any
Person (including any Person acting as underwriter, broker or dealer) agrees to
purchase any of such Bearer Securities pursuant to their original issuance, and
such obligation cannot be avoided by the Company taking reasonable measures
available to it; provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given
-------- 
earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company would be
obligated to pay such additional interest were a payment in respect of the
Bearer Securities of that series then due. Prior to the publication of any
notice of redemption pursuant to this Section 13.02(a), the Company shall
deliver to the Trustee (i) an Officers' Certificate stating that the Company is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company so to redeem
have occurred and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Company has
or will become obligated to pay such additional interest as a result of such
change or amendment.

(b) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, if the
Company shall determine that any payment made outside the United States by the
Company or any of its Paying Agents in respect of any Bearer Security or Coupon,
if any, that is not a Floating Rate Security (an "Affected Security") would,
under any present or future laws or regulations of the United States, be subject
to any certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement
of any kind, the effect of which requirement is the disclosure to the Company,
any Paying Agent or any governmental authority of the nationality, residence or
identity of a beneficial owner of such Affected Security that is a United States
Alien (other than such a requirement (i) that would not be applicable to a
payment made
<PAGE>

93

by the Company or any one of its Paying Agents (A) directly to the beneficial
owner or (B) to a custodian, nominee or other agent of the beneficial owner, or
(ii) that can be satisfied by such custodian, nominee or other agent certifying
to the effect that the beneficial owner is a United States Alien; provided,
--------- 
that, in any case referred to in clause (i)(B) or (ii), payment by the
custodian, nominee or agent to the beneficial owner is not otherwise subject to
any such requirement), then the Company shall elect either (x) to redeem such
Affected Securities in whole, but not in part, at the Redemption Price thereof
(calculated without premium) or (y) if the conditions of the next succeeding
paragraph are satisfied, to pay the additional interest specified in such
paragraph. The Company shall make such determination as soon as practicable and
publish prompt notice thereof (the "Determination Notice"), stating the
effective date of such certification, documentation, information or other
reporting requirement, whether the Company elects to redeem the Affected
Securities or to pay the additional interest specified in the next succeeding
paragraph and (if applicable) the last date by which the redemption of the
Affected Securities must take place, as provided in the next succeeding
sentence. If any Affected Securities are to be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph, the redemption shall take place on such date, not later than one year
after the publication of the Determination Notice, as the Company shall specify
by notice given to the Trustee at least 60 days before the Redemption Date.
Notice of such redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Affected
Securities not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the Redemption
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not so redeem the
Affected Securities if the Company shall subsequently determine, not less than
30 days prior to the Redemption Date, that subsequent payments on the Affected
Securities would not be subject to any such certification, documentation,
information or other reporting requirement, in which case the Company shall
publish prompt notice of such subsequent determination, and any earlier
redemption notice given pursuant to this paragraph shall be revoked and of no
further effect. Prior to the publication of any Determination Notice pursuant
to this paragraph, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee (i) an Officers'
Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to make such determination and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the
obligation of the Company to redeem the Affected Securities or to pay the
additional interest specified in the next succeeding paragraph have occurred and
(ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
<PAGE>

94

such conditions have occurred.

If and so long as the certification, documentation, information or
other reporting requirement referred to in the preceding paragraph would be
fully satisfied by payment of a backup withholding tax or similar charge, the
Company may elect to pay as additional interest such amounts as may be necessary
so that every net payment made outside the United States following the effective
date of such requirement by the Company or any of its Paying Agents in respect
of any Affected Security of which the beneficial owner is a United States Alien
(but without any requirement that the nationality, residence or identity of such
beneficial owner be disclosed to the Company, any Paying Agent or any
governmental authority), after deduction or withholding for or on account of
such backup withholding tax or similar charge (other than a backup withholding
tax or similar charge that (i) would not be applicable in the circumstances
referred to in the parenthetical clause of the first sentence of the preceding
paragraph or (ii) is imposed as a result of presentation of any such Affected
Security for payment more than 15 days after the date on which such payment
became due and payable or on which payment thereof was duly provided for,
whichever occurred later), will not be less than the amounts provided for in any
such Affected Security to be then due and payable. If the Company elects to pay
additional interest pursuant to this paragraph, then the Company shall have the
right to redeem the Affected Securities at any time in whole, but not in part,
at the Redemption Price thereof (calculated without premium), subject to the
provisions of the last three sentences of the immediately preceding paragraph.
If the Company elects to pay additional interest pursuant to this paragraph and
the condition specified in the first sentence of this paragraph should no longer
be satisfied, then the Company shall redeem the Affected Securities in whole,
but not in part, at the Redemption Price thereof (calculated without premium),
subject to the provisions of the last three sentences of the immediately
preceding paragraph. Any redemption payments made by the Company pursuant to
the two immediately preceding sentences shall be subject to the continuing
obligation of the Company to pay additional interest pursuant to this paragraph.
If the Company elects to, or is required to, redeem the Affected Securities
pursuant to this paragraph, it shall publish prompt notice thereof. If the
Affected Securities are to be redeemed pursuant to this paragraph, the
redemption shall take place on such date, not later than one year after the
publication of the notice of
<PAGE>

95

redemption, as the Company shall specify by notice to the Trustee at least 60
days prior to the Redemption Date.

SECTION 13.03. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee. The election
-------------------------------------- 
of the Company to redeem any Debt Securities shall be evidenced by a Board
Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less
than all of the Debt Securities of any series pursuant to Section 13.04, the
Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the
Company (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Debt
Securities of such series to be redeemed. In case of any redemption at the
election of the Company of all of the Debt Securities of any series, the Company
shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company
(unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the
Trustee of such Redemption Date. In the case of any redemption of Debt
Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption
provided in the terms of such Debt Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture,
the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing
compliance with such restrictions.

SECTION 13.04. Selection by Trustee of Debt Securities To Be
---------------------------------------------
Redeemed. Except in the case of a redemption in whole of the Bearer Securities
- --------- 
or the Registered Securities of such series, if less than all the Debt
Securities of any series are to be redeemed at the option of the Company (other
than as provided in Section 13.02), the particular Debt Securities to be
redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by
the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series not previously
called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions
(equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such
series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Debt
Securities of such series in a denomination larger than the minimum authorized
denomination for Debt Securities of such series. In any case where more than
one Registered Security of such series is registered in the same name, the
Trustee in its discretion may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered
as if it were represented by one Registered Security of such series.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in
<PAGE>

96

writing of the Debt Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any
Debt Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to
be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Debt Securities shall
relate, in the case of any Debt Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in
part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debt Security that has been
or is to be redeemed.

SECTION 13.05. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be
--------------------- 
given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name
and at the expense of the Company, not less than 30 days and not more than 60
days prior to the Redemption Date, to the Holders of Debt Securities of any
series to be redeemed in whole or in part pursuant to this Article XIII, in the
manner provided in Section 1.05. Any notice so given shall be conclusively
presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such
notice. Failure to give such notice, or any defect in such notice to the Holder
of any Debt Security of a series designated for redemption, in whole or in part,
shall not affect the sufficiency of any notice of redemption with respect to the
Holder of any other Debt Security of such series.

All notices of redemption shall identify the Debt Securities to be
redeemed (including CUSIP numbers) and shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price,

(3) that Debt Securities of such series are being redeemed by the
Company pursuant to provisions contained in this Indenture or the terms of
the Debt Securities of such series or a supplemental indenture establishing
such series, if such be the case, together with a brief statement of the
facts permitting such redemption,

(4) if less than all Outstanding Debt Securities of any series are to
be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption,
the principal amounts) of the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed,
<PAGE>

97

(5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due
and payable upon each such Debt Security to be redeemed, and that interest
thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date,

(6) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Coupon Securities
of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by
all Coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption, failing
which the amount of any such missing Coupon or Coupons will be deducted
from the Redemption Price,

(7) the Place or Places of Payment where such Debt Securities are to
be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price,

(8) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any
Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such
Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to
redemption on this Redemption Date pursuant to Section 305(b) or otherwise,
the last date on which such exchanges may be made,

(9) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case,
and

(10) if any Debt Security of any series is to be redeemed in part,
that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Debt Security
and any Coupons appertaining thereto, a new Debt Security or Debt
Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof and with appropriate Coupons will be issued or, in the case
of Debt Securities providing appropriate space for such notation, at the
option of the Holders, the Trustee, in lieu of delivering a new Debt
Security or Debt Securities as aforesaid, may make a notation on such Debt
Security of the payment of the redeemed portion thereof.

SECTION 13.06. Deposit of Redemption Price. On or prior to the
---------------------------- 
Redemption Date for any Registered Securities, the Company shall deposit with
the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own
Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 12.04) an
amount of money in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are
<PAGE>

98

denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.01) sufficient to pay the
Redemption Price of such Debt Securities or any portions thereof that are to be
redeemed on that date. In the case of any redemption pertaining to Bearer or
Coupon Securities, the Company shall, no later than the Business Day prior to
such Redemption Date, deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (other
than the Company) an amount of money in the Currency in which such Debt
Securities are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.01)
sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of such Debt Securities or any portion
thereof that are to be redeemed on the Redemption Date.

SECTION 13.07. Debt Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of
------------------------------------------- 
redemption having been given as aforesaid, any Debt Securities so to be redeemed
shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price
and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of
the Redemption Price) such Debt Securities shall cease to bear interest and any
Coupons for such interest appertaining to any Coupon Securities to be redeemed,
except to the extent described below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such
Debt Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Debt Security
shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
installments of interest that have a Stated Maturity on or prior to the
Redemption Date for such Debt Securities shall be payable according to the terms
of such Debt Securities and the provisions of Section 3.07.

If any Debt Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall,
until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed
therefor in the Debt Security.

If any Coupon Security surrendered for redemption shall not be
accompanied by all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing on or after the
Redemption Date, the Redemption Price for such Coupon Security may be reduced by
an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons. If thereafter
the Holder of such Coupon shall surrender to any Paying Agent outside the United
States any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been
made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the
amount so deducted. The surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be
waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to them such
<PAGE>

99

security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying
Agent harmless.

SECTION 13.08. Debt Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Debt Security
--------------------------------- 
that is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the Corporate Trust
Office or such other office or agency of the Company as is specified pursuant to
Section 3.01 (in the case of Registered Securities) and at the principal London
office of the Trustee or such other office or agency of the Company outside the
United States as is specified pursuant to Section 3.01 (in the case of Bearer
Securities) with, if the Company, the Security Registrar or the Trustee so
requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company, the Security Registrar and the Trustee duly
executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the
Holder of such Debt Security without service charge, a new Debt Security or Debt
Securities of the same series, of like tenor and form, of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to
and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Debt Security
so surrendered, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with appropriate Coupons
attached; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for
such Global Security, without service charge, a new Global Security in a
denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
principal of the Global Security so surrendered. In the case of a Debt Security
providing appropriate space for such notation, at the option of the Holder
thereof, the Trustee, in lieu of delivering a new Debt Security or Debt
Securities as aforesaid, may make a notation on such Debt Security of the
payment of the redeemed portion thereof.

ARTICLE XIV

Sinking Funds
-------------

SECTION 14.01. Applicability of Article. The provisions of this
------------------------- 
Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Debt
Securities of a series except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01
for Debt Securities of such series.
<PAGE>

100

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the
terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory
sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided
for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as an
"optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Debt
Securities of any series, the amount of any cash sinking fund payment may be
subject to reduction as provided in Section 14.02. Each sinking fund payment
shall be applied to the redemption of Debt Securities of any series as provided
for by the terms of Debt Securities of such series.

SECTION 14.02. Satisfaction of Mandatory Sinking Fund Payments with
----------------------------------------------------
Debt Securities. In lieu of making all or any part of a mandatory sinking fund

payment with respect to any Debt Securities of a series in cash, the Company may
at its option, at any time no more than sixteen months and no less than 45 days
prior to the date on which such sinking fund payment is due, deliver to the
Trustee Debt Securities of such series (together with the unmatured Coupons, if
any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Company, except Debt Securities of such series that have been redeemed through
the application of mandatory or optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the
terms of the Debt Securities of such series, accompanied by a Company Order
instructing the Trustee to credit such obligations and stating that the Debt
Securities of such series were originally issued by the Company by way of bona
fide sale or other negotiation for value; provided that such Debt Securities
-------- 
shall not have been previously so credited. Such Debt Securities shall be
received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price
specified in such Debt Securities for redemption through operation of the
sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be
reduced accordingly.

SECTION 14.03. Redemption of Debt Securities for Sinking Fund. Not
----------------------------------------------- 
less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Debt
Securities (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), the
Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the
amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the
terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by
payment of cash in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are
denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.01) and the portion
<PAGE>

101

thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Debt
Securities of such series pursuant to Section 14.02 and whether the Company
intends to exercise its rights to make a permitted optional sinking fund payment
with respect to such series. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its
delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments
therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund
payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such
certificate (or, as required by this Indenture, the Debt Securities and Coupons,
if any, specified in such certificate), the sinking fund payment due on the next
succeeding sinking fund payment date for such series shall be paid entirely in
cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of the Debt
Securities of such series subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without
the right to deliver or credit Debt Securities as provided in Section 14.02 and
without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment with respect to such
series at such time.

Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in
cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made with
respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the
Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) on
the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment
is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date
immediately following the date of such payment) to the redemption of Debt
Securities of such series at the Redemption Price specified in such Debt
Securities with respect to the sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so
applied or allocated by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting
as its own Paying Agent) to the redemption of Debt Securities shall be added to
the next sinking fund payment received by the Trustee (or if the Company is
acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in
Section 12.04) for such series and, together with such payment (or such amount
so segregated) shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 14.03. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Debt
Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (or if the Company is
acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in
Section 12.04) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Debt
Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of
particular Debt Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by
the Company if the Company is
<PAGE>

102

acting as its own Paying Agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be
deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the
principal of the Debt Securities of such series at Maturity.

The Trustee shall select or cause to be selected the Debt Securities
to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in
Section 13.04 and the Company shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be
given in the manner provided in Section 13.05. Such notice having been duly
given, the redemption of such Debt Securities shall be made upon the terms and
in the manner stated in Section 13.07.

On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to
the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company
shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 12.04) in cash a sum in
the Currency in which Debt Securities of such series are denominated (except as
provided pursuant to Section 3.01) equal to the principal and any interest
accrued to the Redemption Date for Debt Securities or portions thereof to be
redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section.

Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall redeem any Debt Securities
of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Debt
Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund for such series
during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on any Debt
Securities of such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to the Debt
Securities of such series, except that, if the notice of redemption shall have
been provided in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee (or the
Company if the Company is then acting as its own Paying Agent) shall redeem such
Debt Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the
Trustee (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the
terms of this Article. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for
such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur
and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the
continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the
payment of the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of such series; provided,
-------- 
however, that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or
- ------- 
waived as provided herein, such moneys shall
<PAGE>

103

thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for the Debt
Securities of such series on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the
provisions of this Section.

ARTICLE XV

----------

SECTION 15.01. Applicability of Article. If, pursuant to Section
------------------------- 
3.01, provision is made for the defeasance of Debt Securities of a series and if
the Debt Securities of such series are Registered Securities and denominated and
payable only in Dollars (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.01), then the

pursuant to Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of such series. Defeasance
provisions, if any, for Debt Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency or for
Bearer Securities may be specified pursuant to Section 3.01.

SECTION 15.02. Defeasance Upon Deposit of Moneys or U.S. Government
----------------------------------------------------

set forth below have been satisfied or (b) the Company shall cease to be under
any obligation to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in
Section 10.01 or 12.05 with respect to Debt Securities of any series (and, if so

the opinion (with respect to (ii) and (iii)) of a nationally
<PAGE>

104

recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge each
installment of principal (including any mandatory sinking fund payments) of
and premium, if any, and interest on, the Outstanding Debt Securities of
such series on the dates such installments of interest or principal and
premium are due;

(2) if the Debt Securities of such series are then listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Company's exercise of its option
under this Section would not cause such Debt Securities to be delisted;

(3) no Event of Default or event (including such deposit) that, with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with
respect to the Debt Securities of such series shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such deposit; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that Holders of the Debt Securities of such series
will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as
a result of the Company's exercise of its option under this Section and
will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such option had
not been exercised and, in the case of the Debt Securities of such series
being Discharged, accompanied by a ruling to that effect received from or
published by the Internal Revenue Service.

"Discharged" means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire indebtedness represented by, and obligations under, the
Debt Securities of such series and to have satisfied all the obligations under
this Indenture relating to the Debt Securities of such series (and the Trustee,
at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging
the same), except (A) the rights of Holders of Debt Securities of such series to
receive, from the trust fund described in clause (1) above, payment of the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Debt Securities when
such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to the Debt
Securities of such series under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 12.03, 15.03 and

<PAGE>

105

duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder.

"U.S. Government Obligations" means securities that are (i) direct
obligations of the United States for the payment of which its full faith and
credit is pledged or (ii) obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by
and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States the timely
payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit
obligation by the United States, that, in either case under clauses (i) or (ii),
are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and shall
also include a depository receipt issued by a bank or trust company as custodian
with respect to any such U.S. Government Obligation or a specific payment of
interest on or principal of any such U.S. Government Obligation held by such
custodian for the account of the holder of a depository receipt; provided that
-------- 
(except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any
deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from
any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government
Obligation or the specific payment of interest on or principal of the U.S.
Government Obligation evidenced by such depository receipt.

SECTION 15.03. Deposited Moneys and U.S. Government Obligations To Be
------------------------------------------------------
Held in Trust. All moneys and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the
- -------------- 
Trustee pursuant to Section 15.02 in respect of Debt Securities of a series
shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of
such Debt Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or
through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent)
as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Debt Securities, of all
sums due and to become due thereon for principal (and premium, if any) and
interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except
to the extent required by law.

SECTION 15.04. Repayment to Company. The Trustee and any Paying
--------------------- 
Agent shall promptly pay or return to the Company upon Company Request any
moneys or U.S. Government Obligations held by them at any time that are not
required for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest
on the Debt Securities of any series for which money or U.S. Government
Obligations have been deposited pursuant to Section 15.02.

The provisions of the last paragraph of Section 12.04
<PAGE>

106

shall apply to any money held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent under this
Article that remains unclaimed for two years after the Maturity of any series of
Debt Securities for which money or U.S. Government Obligations have been
deposited pursuant to Section 15.02.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts
shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
