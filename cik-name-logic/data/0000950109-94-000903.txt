NEWS RELEASE

For Release: May 25, 1994

PECO Energy To Sell Conowingo Power Company
To Delmarva Power & Light Company

PECO Energy Company announced that it has entered into a stock purchase 
agreement to sell its Maryland retail electric subsidiary, Conowingo Power 
Company (COPCO) to Delmarva Power & Light Company.

Under the terms of the sale, Delmarva Power will pay $150 million for 
COPCO. The transaction also includes a ten year contract for PECO Energy to sell
power to Delmarva Power. The sale is subject to State and Federal regulatory 
approvals.

In announcing the agreement, PECO Energy Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Joseph F. Paquette Jr. said, "After a comprehensive evaluation, the 
Board selected the proposal which would bring value to our shareholders, while
at the same time, provide for lower rates to COPCO customers."

In commenting on this purchase Delmarva Power Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer, Howard Cosgrove said, "This agreement makes winners out of all 
concerned. COPCO customers benefit from a lower cost of service. Also, it 
improves Delmarva's business position while adequately compensating PECO 
Energy shareholders."

The agreement provides that upon the closing COPCO employees will be 
employed by Delmarva Power.

This sale agreement does not involve the Conowingo Hydro-Electric Station,
which is owned by Susquehanna Power Company, a PECO Energy subsidiary. 
Electric service to York County (Pa.) customers now served by COPCO will be 
provided by PECO Energy.

Conowingo Power Company supplies electric service to about 35,000 customers
in portions of Cecil and Harford (Md.) counties with annual revenues of $77.5 
million.
