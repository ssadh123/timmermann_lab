Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On December 22, 1993, Atmos Energy Corporation ("Atmos") acquired by
means of a merger all of the assets and liabilities of Greeley Gas Company
("Greeley") in accordance with the terms and provisions of an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization dated July 2, 1993 (the "Agreement") by and among
Atmos, Greeley Gas Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Atmos ("Acquisition Corp"), and Greeley. Under the terms of the Agreement,
Greeley merged with and into Acquisition Corp, with Acquisition Corp being
the surviving corporation. All of the shares of Greeley's common stock
were exchanged for a total of 2,329,330 shares of Atmos common stock.
(Fractional shares were paid in cash.) Immediately following the merger of
Greeley and Acquisition Corp, Acquisition Corp was merged with and into its
parent, Atmos.

The amount of consideration paid for the outstanding stock of Greeley
was established in the Agreement. Atmos based its offer to pay such
consideration on various factors, including the nature and quality of
Greeley's assets, the financial condition and business prospects of
Greeley, and the impact on Atmos' earnings per share. Atmos and
Acquisition Corp also received a separate fairness opinion from Stephens
Inc., their investment banker and financial advisor.

Greeley was a privately owned natural gas utility engaged in the
distribution and sale of natural gas to residential, commercial,
industrial, agricultural, and other customers throughout Colorado, Kansas,
and a small portion of Missouri. Greeley's assets consisted of physical
property, plant, and equipment (including a pipeline system consisting of
208 miles of gathering system, 219 miles of transmission pipeline, and
3,242 miles of distribution main) used in the conduct of its utility
business.
