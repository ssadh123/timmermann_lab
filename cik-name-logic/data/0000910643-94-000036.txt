INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

We have audited the accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain
Operating Expenses of Sedgefield Apartments (the "Property") for the year
ended October 31, 1993. This Historical Summary is the responsibility of
New Plan Realty Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on this Historical Summary based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical Summary is free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Historical Summary has been prepared for the purpose of complying with
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
its use for any other purpose may be inappropriate. Accordingly, as
described in the Note to the Historical Summary, the statement excludes
interest, depreciation, and general and administrative expenses for the
period examined, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the
Property's revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the revenues and certain operating expenses
(exclusive of interest, depreciation and general and administrative
expenses) in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTE:

The Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain Operating Expenses relates
to the operations of Sedgefield Apartments (the "Property") while under
ownership previous to New Plan Realty Trust. The Property is a residential
apartment complex.

The summary has been prepared on the accrual method of accounting. 
Operating expenses include maintenance and repair expenses, utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. In accordance with the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest
expense, depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been
excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular
owner, purchase price or financial arrangement.

INFORMATION PURSUANT TO RULE 3-14 REGULATION S-X

Part I MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

Management's assessment of the Property prior to acquisition includes,
but is not limited to, the quality of the tenant base, regional
demographics, the competitive environment, operating expenses and local
property taxes. In addition, the physical aspect of the property,
location, condition and quality of design and construction are evaluated. 
Management also always conducts Phase I and II environmental tests. All
factors, when viewed in their entirety, have met management's acquisition
criteria. Management is not aware of any material factors relating to the
acquisition other than those discussed above. 

Part II ESTIMATES OF TAXABLE OPERATING INCOME AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM
CERTAIN PROPERTY ACQUIRED (UNAUDITED)

from the operation of the acquired Property for a twelve month period
ended October 31, 1993 based on the Historical Summary of Revenues and
Certain Operating Expenses for the Year Ended October 31, 1993. These
estimated results do not purport to present expected results of
operations for the Property in the future and were prepared on the
basis described in the accompanying notes which should be read in
conjunction herewith.

(UNAUDITED)

Basis of Presentation

1. Estimated depreciation was based upon an allocation of the
purchase price to land (20%) and building (80%) with the
depreciation being taken over a 40 year life using the straight
line method.

2. No income taxes have been provided because New Plan Realty Trust
is taxed as a real estate investment trust under the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Trust does not
pay Federal income tax whenever income distributed to
shareholders is equal to at least 95% of real estate investment
trust taxable income and certain other conditions are met.

The pro forma condensed statements of income for the year ended July
31, 1993 and the nine months ended April 30, 1994 assume the acquisition of
this property as if it had occurred as of August 1, 1992 and 1993,
respectively. This pro forma information is based on the historical
statements of the Trust after giving effect to the acquisition of this
property.

indicated. Also, they may not be indicative of the results that may be
achieved in the future. The unaudited pro forma condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with New Plan Realty Trust's
audited financial statements as of July 31, 1993 and for the year then
ended (which are contained in the Trust's Form 10-K for the year ended
