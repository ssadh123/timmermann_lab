For Immediate Release
Tuesday, October 18, 1994

New York, October 18 -- Chemical Banking Corporation today
reported third quarter net income of $439 million, or $1.60 per
common share, up 24 percent from earnings on a comparable basis of
$355 million, or $1.26 per share, in the third quarter of 1993.

Reported net income in last year's third quarter was $502
million, or $1.84 per share, which included income tax benefits of
$214 million and a one-time merger-related charge of $115 million
($67 million after-tax).

For the first nine months of 1994, net income was $1.115
billion, an increase of 16 percent from $958 million on a
comparable basis in the same period a year ago.

"Earnings benefited from solid performances in several core
businesses, including national consumer services and capital
markets-related activities, while credit costs continued to
decrease significantly," said Walter V. Shipley, chairman and chief
executive officer. "We also increased the common dividend by 16
percent and completed a stock repurchase program during the
quarter, reflecting our continued positive outlook for the
corporation."

The provision for losses for the third quarter was $100
million, down 38 percent from $160 million in the second quarter
and down 66 percent from $298 million in the third quarter a year
ago. At September 30, total nonperforming assets were $2,193
million, down 12 percent from $2,493 million at June 30 and down 47
percent from $4,132 million on September 30 a year ago.

<PAGE> 6

CAPITAL ACTIONS

On September 20, the corporation increased the quarterly
dividend on the outstanding shares of its common stock to 44 cents
per share, up 16 percent from 38 cents per share. On an annual
basis, this represents an increase in the dividend rate to $1.76,
from $1.52. Since March 1993, the corporation has increased the
common dividend by 47 percent. In addition, during the third
quarter the corporation completed the repurchase of 10 million
shares of its common stock in the open market under a stock
repurchase plan originally announced on May 27, 1994.

The corporation also redeemed its approximately $400 million
of Adjustable Rate Series C Preferred Stock on July 15, 1994 and
issued $200 million of Series L Adjustable Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock on June 8, 1994. The one-time premium paid upon
redemption to holders of the Series C Preferred Stock reduced net
income per common share in the current quarter by $.05.

The corporation's estimated Tier I risk-based capital ratio
was 8.1 percent at September 30, compared with 7.9 percent a year
ago. At September 30, the estimated total risk-based capital ratio
was 12.3 percent, compared with 12.1 percent a year ago.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income for the third quarter was $1,177 million,
compared with $1,163 million in the same year-ago period. The
rise in net interest income is attributable to an increase in
average interest-earning assets.

Average interest-earning assets for the third quarter were
$129.5 billion, compared with $125.8 billion in the same year-ago
period.

The net yield on average interest-earning assets was 3.63
percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.68 percent in the
third quarter of 1993.

Average interest-earning assets increased when compared with
the second quarter of 1994, primarily reflecting growth in consumer
loans, particularly from mortgage and credit card activities, and
in commercial loans, including those to middle market companies.

NONINTEREST REVENUE

Noninterest revenue for the third quarter was $984 million,
compared with $1,004 million in the same period a year ago.

Trust and investment management fees were $104 million in the
third quarter, compared with $97 million in the year-ago quarter,
reflecting the acquisition of Ameritrust Texas Corporation.

<PAGE> 7

Corporate finance fees were $97 million in the third quarter,
up from $95 million in the third quarter a year ago.

Fees for other banking services were $285 million in the
quarter, up from $266 million in the year-ago third quarter. This
improvement primarily reflected increased revenues generated by the
new co-branded Shell MasterCard.

Combined revenues from all trading activities were $212
million in the third quarter versus $268 million in the same year-
ago period, but up from $203 million in the second quarter and from
$185 million in the first quarter of 1994. The consistent results
of the past three quarters reflected the corporation's emphasis on
market-making and customer-related activities in its trading
business, while results for the third quarter of 1993 were affected
by a more favorable trading environment in certain markets such as
domestic fixed income and foreign exchange.

Other noninterest revenue for the third quarter was $202
million versus $154 million in the same period a year ago.
Revenues on equity-related investments in the third quarter were
$86 million, compared with $57 million in the same year-ago period.
The current quarter included $80 million from the sale of LDC-
related past-due interest bonds, versus $52 million from the sale
of such bonds in the 1993 third quarter.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense in the third quarter was $1,311 million,
compared with $1,255 million (excluding the one-time merger-related
charge of $115 million) in the third quarter of 1993.

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 1994 included $28
million of expenses resulting from the July 1, 1994 acquisition of
Margaretten Financial Corporation. Expenses for the third quarter
of 1994 also reflected operating expenses of approximately $11
million associated with Ameritrust and $30 million in operating
costs connected with the Shell MasterCard.

Foreclosed property expense was $2 million in the quarter,
compared with $70 million in the third quarter a year ago,
reflecting significant progress in managing the corporation's
foreclosed real estate portfolio.

Total headcount at September 30, 1994 was 42,492 (including
1,574 from the Margaretten acquisition), compared with 41,670 at
September 30, 1993.

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES

The provision for losses was $100 million in the third
quarter, compared with $160 million in the second quarter of 1994
and $298 million in the third quarter of 1993.

Total net charge-offs were $125 million in the third quarter,
compared with $185 million (excluding the final valuation of the
LDC portfolio) in the second quarter of 1994 and $325 million in
the third quarter a year ago. Included in these amounts were
consumer net charge-offs of $100 million in the third quarter,
compared with consumer net charge-offs of $94 million in the second
quarter and $84 million in the third quarter a year ago.

Recoveries in the third quarter were $76 million, compared
with $55 million in the second quarter and $67 million in the third
quarter a year ago.

At September 30, the total allowance for losses was $2,650
million, compared with $2,972 million on the same date a year ago.
The LDC allowance was transferred to the general reserve in the
second quarter of 1994 following completion of the Brazilian
refinancing package and the final valuation of the LDC portfolio.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS

At September 30, total nonperforming assets were $2,193
million, down $300 million from June 30 and down $1,939 million, or
47 percent, from September 30, 1993.

Nonperforming loans at September 30 were $1,524 million, down
from $1,758 million at June 30 and down from $3,046 million at
September 30 last year. Assets acquired as loan satisfactions were
$669 million at September 30, down from $735 million at June 30 and
down $417 million from $1,086 million on September 30 a year ago.

OTHER FINANCIAL DATA

As previously mentioned, on July 1 Chemical completed its
tender offer for all of the outstanding common stock and the
depositary shares representing the preferred stock of Margaretten
Financial Corporation, a leading mortgage banking company. With
this acquisition, Chemical now ranks fourth nationwide in mortgage
originations and fifth in mortgage servicing.

The corporation's effective tax rate was 41.5 percent in the
third quarter. Tax expense in the year-ago third quarter included
an income tax benefit of $214 million.

The impact of marking the "Available for Sale" securities to
market resulted in a net unfavorable impact of approximately $296
million after-tax on the corporation's stockholders' equity at
September 30, 1994, compared with a net unfavorable impact of 

<PAGE> 9

$291 million after-tax at June 30, 1994. The market valuation 
does not include the favorable impact of related funding sources.

On January 1, 1994, the corporation adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 39, which changed the reporting of unrealized
gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange contracts on
the balance sheet. The adoption of this Interpretation has
resulted in an increase of assets and liabilities of $17.0 billion
at September 30, 1994, with unrealized gains reported as Trading
Assets-Risk Management Instruments and the unrealized losses
reported in Other Liabilities.

Net income for the first nine months of 1993 included a $35
million net favorable impact from the January 1, 1993 adoption of
two accounting standards relating to the recognition of tax
benefits and the costs associated with postretirement benefits.

Total assets at September 30 were $169.3 billion, versus
$149.4 billion on the same date a year ago. Total loans at
September 30 were $77.1 billion, compared with $77.8 billion a year
ago. At the end of the third quarter, total deposits were $93.0
billion, compared with $95.5 billion at September 30, 1993.

The return on average total assets was 1.03 percent for the
third quarter, compared with 1.39 percent (.98 percent excluding
tax benefits and the one-time charge to expense) in the same year-
ago period.

The return on average common stockholders' equity was 16.92
percent for the third quarter, compared with 20.90 percent (14.26
percent excluding tax benefits and the one-time charge to expense)
in the year-ago third quarter.

Book value per common share was $38.29 at September 30, versus
$35.96 per share on the same date a year ago.

TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES

Texas Commerce Bancshares (TCB) reported net income of $57
million in the third quarter, unchanged from a year ago. Its net
yield on interest-earning assets was 4.29 percent in the third
quarter, versus 3.75 percent in the 1993 third quarter. At
September 30, total assets of TCB were $20.1 billion, versus $22.0
billion a year ago.
