Item 5. Other Events
- ---------------------

New England Power Company (the Company), a subsidiary of New
England Electric System, has been sued by Milford Power Limited
Partnership (MPLP) in the Superior Court for Worcester County,
Massachusetts. MPLP, a venture formed by Enron Corporation, owns
a 149 MW gas-fired power plant in Milford, Massachusetts. The
Company purchases 56% of the power output of the facility under a
long-term contract with MPLP. The suit alleges that the Company
has engaged in a scheme to cause MPLP and its power plant to fail
and has prevented MPLP from finding a long-term buyer for the
remaining 44% of the facility's output. The complaint includes
allegations that the Company has violated the Federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, engaged in unfair or
deceptive acts in trade or commerce, and breached contracts. 
MPLP seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, as well
as treble damages. The Company believes that the allegations of
wrongdoing are without merit.
