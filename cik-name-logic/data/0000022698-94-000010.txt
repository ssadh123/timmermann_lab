COMSAT REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 1994 RESULTS
AND DECLARES DIVIDEND

BETHESDA, MD - COMSAT Corporation (NYSE:CQ) today reported record
first quarter 1994 revenues of $169.5 million, up two percent
over the $166.3 million reported for the same period a year
earlier. Net income was $18.3 million, or 45 cents per share,
compared to the same numbers for the first quarter of 1993 --
before the cumulative effect for the change in tax accounting.

"We are committed to achieving our goal of double-digit
growth in earnings for the year," said Bruce L. Crockett,
President and CEO. "We are continuing to look for additional
opportunities to enhance revenues and have implemented cost-
containment programs."

COMSAT Video Enterprises, Inc. (CVE) saw revenues grow 20
percent, from $21.7 million a year ago to $26.1 million in the
first quarter of this year. Operating income was $2.2 million,
slightly less than a year ago, based on depreciation costs and
severe winter weather along the East Coast and the California
earthquake that hindered the rate of installations and sales. The
total number of installed and backlog hotel rooms for the On
Command Video service reached 293,000 in the first quarter,
compared to 111,000 for the same period last year.

Revenues in the International Communications segment, which
includes COMSAT World Systems (CWS) and COMSAT International
Ventures (CIV), were $63.9 million, or about $1 million less than
a year ago. An increase in traffic was offset by rate cuts in
long-term contracts. Operating income was down 21 percent to
$22.0 million -- largely due to a depreciation increase of 14
percent, resulting from the launch of the first INTELSAT VII
satellite in the fourth quarter of 1993.

COMSAT Mobile Communications (CMC) revenues fell by 12
percent to $44 million from $50.0 million a year earlier. The
drop was due primarily to a decrease in traffic from a year
earlier when world events such as the crisis in

Somalia result in record system usage, and also was offset by
price cuts and conversions to digital service. Operating income
was off 23 percent, $13.0 million to $10.0 million, from the same
period a year ago due to lower revenues and additional
depreciation.

Crockett said rate reductions in both CWS and CMC "were
factored into our financial planning and we expect improved
results for the remainder of the year." He said the company's
belief that lower rates will stimulate demand has already begun
to show up in World System's traffic.

COMSAT Technology Services (CTS) revenues increased 21
percent to $24.3 million from $20.1 million a year earlier. 
Operating income increased $2.1 million from the first quarter of
1993. The CTS merger with Radiation Systems, Inc. of Sterling,
VA, will be completed in the second quarter of 1994. The new
business unit will be called COMSAT RSI.

Other corporate revenues were up $1.6 million, primarily due
to the success of the company's NBA Denver Nuggets, which showed
paid attendance, ticket sales and net gate receipts sharply
higher than a year earlier, when bond redemption costs were
incurred.

The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend
of 18.5 cents per share, payable June 13, 1994, to shareholders
of record May 13, 1994. This is the 95th consecutive quarterly
dividend declared by the corporation.

COMSAT Corporation (NYSE:CQ) is an international
communications, information and entertainment-distribution
services company. It provides voice, video and data services to
customers worldwide by fixed and mobile technologies and is the
largest owner and user of the global INTELSAT and Inmarsat
communications satellite networks. COMSAT Corporation also
furnishes satellite systems integration, wireless networks and
technical consulting; offers on-demand entertainment and
information services to the hospitality industry, and owns the
NBA Denver Nuggets.
