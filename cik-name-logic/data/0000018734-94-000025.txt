Item 5. Other Events

Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Deferred Accounting

New Developments

On June 22, 1994, the Supreme Court of Texas issued a
decision in the deferred accounting case of Central Power
and Light Company (CPL or Company).

In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court of Texas sustained
deferred accounting as an appropriate mechanism for the
Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Commission) to use
in preserving the financial integrity of utilities. The
Supreme Court of Texas held that the Texas Commission can
authorize utilities to defer those costs that are incurred
between the in-service date of a plant and the effectiveness
of new rates, which includes such costs.

The Supreme Court of Texas upheld the portion of the
1992 Third Court of Appeals', Austin, Texas (Court of
Appeals) decision that permitted CPL to include in rate base
deferred post-in-service operations and maintenance costs
from Unit 1 of the South Texas Project (STP) nuclear plant.
The Supreme Court of Texas also reversed the portion of the
Court of Appeals decision providing that deferred post-in-
service carrying costs could not be included in rate base.
In addition, the Supreme Court of Texas remanded the case to
the Court of Appeals for consideration of specific
unresolved arguments. CPL's total pre-tax STP deferrals for
the periods affected were approximately $492 million, of
which $270 million are carrying costs.

While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
CPL's deferred accounting proceeding, management believes
that CPL will successfully sustain approval of its deferred
accounting orders or will be successful in renegotiation of
its rate settlement, so there will be no material adverse
effect on the Cormpany's financial position or continuing
results of operations.

The parties have 15 days in which to apply to the
Supreme Court for a rehearing.
