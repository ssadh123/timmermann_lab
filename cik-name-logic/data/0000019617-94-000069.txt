For Immediate Release

New York, June 16 -- Chemical Bank, National Association announced today
that its wholly-owned subsidiary is extending its tender offer for the common
stock and preferred stock of Margaretten Financial Corporation until 12:00 
midnight, New York City time, on Thursday, June 30, 1994. Chemical, which had 
earlier announced that it anticipated extending the offer to month-end, said 
the purpose of the extension was to facilitate accounting for the acquisition.

As of 12:00 midnight on June 15, 1994, approximately 13,026,435 shares of
common stock and 1,490,224 depositary shares representing the preferred stock of
Margaretten Financial Corporation had been tendered and not withdrawn, 
representing over 97% and 93% of outstanding common shares and depositary 
shares, respectively.

Chemical also announced that the financial condition to be satisfied by
Margaretten prior to Chemical's consummation of the offer relating to the 
amount of Margaretten's adjusted net tangible common equity and the level of 
its servicing portfolio (set forth in paragraph (h) of section 14 of the 
Offer to Purchase) has been satisfied for purposes of a June 30 completion of 
the offer.

Chemical currently anticipates that there will be no further extension of
the offer beyond 12:00 midnight on June 30,1994, with payment for tendered 
shares to be made promptly thereafter.
