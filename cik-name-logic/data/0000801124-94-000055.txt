Item 2.Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On August 17, 1994, Vanguard Real Estate Fund I (the "Fund") sold the
Arden Hills building in its Minnesota Portfolio for $5,550,000. Arden
Hills, purchased in February 1988 for $7,275,000, is the largest of
the three office buildings in the Minnesota Portfolio. In accordance
with the terms of the advisory agreement between the Fund and Aldrich,
Eastman and Waltch (AEW), the Fund paid an acquisition fee of
$145,500, representing 2% of the purchase price, and will pay a dispo-
sition fee of $111,000, representing 2% of the sales price, in connec-
tion with its investment in the Arden Hills building. The Fund also,
at closing, paid a brokerage commission of $111,000. The Fund expects
to realize a capital loss of approximately $1,200,000 on the sale of
the Arden Hills building, substantially all of which was recognized
via a write-down of the investment s carrying value in the second
quarter of 1994.

("Carmel") and Citadel II each occurred on January 1, 1993. Such pro forma

disposed of Arden Hills, Carmel, and Citadel II on January 1, 1993. This
statement should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of
VREF I included in its 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports

NOTES TO PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

(1) To record decreases in rental income, real estate taxes, property
operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization based on the
historical operating results of Arden Hills included in VREF I's
historical results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(2) The Fund currently anticipates that the net proceeds of the Arden
Hills transaction will be paid out with its year-end 1994 distribution
to shareholders. For purposes of pro forma presentation of the Fund's
operating results for the year ended December 31, 1993, Fund manage-
ment has assumed that the net proceeds made available from the Arden
Hills and Carmel transactions were immediately distributed to share
holders on January 1, 1993, and, accordingly, (i) no investment earn-
ings have been imputed on the Arden Hills net proceeds and (ii) a pro
forma adjustment to decrease short-term investment income by $169,000
has been recorded to reverse income earned during the last five months
of 1993 on the funds received from the payoff of the Carmel mortgage
loan investment.

(3) To record a decrease in the investment advisory fee based upon the
decrease in real estate assets held by the Fund.

(4) To record a decrease in the administrative fee based upon the decrease
in assets held by the Fund.

(5) To record decreases in rental income, net income from in-substance
foreclosed assets, mortgage interest expense, real estate taxes,
property operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization based
on the historical operating results of Citadel II and Carmel included
in VREF I s historical results of operations for the year ended Decem-
ber 31, 1993.

(6) To reverse the amount recorded in the provision for possible losses in
1993 related to Carmel and Citadel II.

(7) The estimated $1,200,000 loss on the sale of Arden Hills has not been
included in the pro forma statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 1993 since such loss is a nonrecurring loss after income
from continuing operations. 

Pursuant to the Fund s prospectus, the Fund may not reinvest the net
proceeds received from sales in additional real estate investments
after December 31, 1993. If cash available for investment (giving
effect to Arden Hills and Carmel as if they had been disposed of on
January 1, 1993) were assumed to have been invested in short-term
money market instruments (it is, in the opinion of the Fund's manage
ment, impracticable to assume that a suitable real estate investment
consistent with the Fund s investment objectives would have been
identified for the investment of such available cash) and not assumed
to have been distributed on January 1, 1993, the Fund would have
earned approximately an additional $399,000 in short-term investment
income, using an average interest rate of 3.0%, on a pro forma basis
for the year ended December 31, 1993, resulting in investment income
from short-term investments of $766,000.

historical results of operations for VREF I and Arden Hills for the six-
months ended June 30, 1994, giving effect to the pro forma adjustments
described below. This statement does not purport to be indicative of
results of operations that actually would have resulted if VREF I had

NOTES TO PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE SIX-MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1994

(1) To record decreases in rental income, real estate taxes, property
operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization based on the
historical operating results of Arden Hills included in VREF I's
historical results of operations for the six-months ended June 30,
1994.

(2) To reverse the provision for possible losses recorded in the second
quarter of 1994 to reduce the carrying value of the Arden Hills build
ing to its estimated fair value minus selling costs.

(3) The Fund currently anticipates that the net proceeds of the Arden
Hills transaction will be paid out with its year-end 1994 distribution
to shareholders. For purposes of pro forma presentation of the Fund's
operating results for the six-months ended June 30, 1994, Fund manage-
ment has assumed that the net proceeds made available from this trans-
action were immediately distributed to shareholders on January 1,
1993, and, accordingly, no investment earnings have been imputed on
the Arden Hills net proceeds.

(4) To record a decrease in the investment advisory fee based upon the
decrease in real estate assets held by the Fund.

(5) To record a decrease in the administrative fee based upon a decrease
in assets, resulting from the assumed January 1, 1993 distribution to
shareholders of the net proceeds of the Arden Hills transaction, held
by the Fund.

(6) Pursuant to the Fund s prospectus, the Fund may not reinvest the net
proceeds received from sales in additional real estate investments
after December 31, 1993. If cash available for investment, giving
effect to Arden Hills if it had been disposed of on January 1, 1993,
were assumed to have been invested in short-term money market instru-
ments for the first six months of 1994, and not assumed to have been
distributed on January 1, 1993, the Fund would have earned approxi-
mately $82,000 in short-term investment income, using an average
interest rate of 3.0%, on a pro forma basis for the six-months ended
June 30, 1994.
