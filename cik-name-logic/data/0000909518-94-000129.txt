The Board of Directors
Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.
245 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10167

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special United States tax counsel to The Bear Stearns
Companies Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the issuance of the
Japan Index Call Warrants and the Japan Index Put Warrants described
in the prospectus supplement, subject to completion, dated July 18,
1994 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus dated April 8,
1994 (the "Prospectus").

We have examined the Prospectus Supplement and such corporate records,
agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or
comparable documents of public officials and of officers and
representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such
officers and representatives as we have deemed relevant and necessary
as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth.

In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents
submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the
authenticity of the originals of such later documents. As to all
questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been
independently established, we have relied upon certificates of
officers and representatives of the Company. We have further assumed
that the Warrants will conform to the forms thereof that we have
examined.

Based upon the foregoing we are of the opinion that the statements in
the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain United States
Federal Income Tax Considerations",

insofar as they relate to the provisions of United States federal tax
law therein described, are accurate in all material respects.

We consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to any and all references to our firm in
the Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement.

This opinion is rendered solely for your benefit in connection with
the transactions described above. This opinion may not be used or
relied upon by any other person and may not be disclosed, quoted,
filed with a governmental agency or otherwise referred to without our
prior written consent except as noted above.

Very truly yours,

WEIL, GOTSHAL & MANGES
