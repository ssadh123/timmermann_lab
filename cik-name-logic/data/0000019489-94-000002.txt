CHASE REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 1993 RECORD EARNINGS,
UP 85% TO $313 MILLION 

The Chase Manhattan Corporation today reported record consolidated net
income for the fourth quarter of 1993 of $313 million ($1.53 per share), up 85%
from the $169 million ($.87 per share) reported for the fourth quarter of 1992.

For the full year of 1993, Chase reported consolidated net income of $966
million ($4.79 per share), up 51% from the $639 million ($3.46 per share)
reported for the full year of 1992.

Thomas G. Labrecque, Chase Chairman said, "Chase made great progress in 1993
through an outstanding effort by our employees. With aggressive action
programs, we substantially improved our asset quality, including significant
reductions in our real estate and cross-border exposures. We also strengthened
our capital base to support the growth of our core businesses."

Highlights for the fourth quarter of 1993 included the following.

EARNINGS
- Profitability ratios were strong. Return on assets was 1.18% and return
on common equity was 17.9%.
- The expense to revenue ratio, excluding ORE expenses, improved to 58%.
- The net interest margin was 4.33%.
- Trading revenues were $167 million, up 46% from fourth quarter 1992.
- The provision for possible credit losses declined to $195 million, $110
million less than the fourth quarter of 1992.

ASSET QUALITY
- Within nine months, Chase liquidated almost 80% of the assets held for
accelerated disposition, reducing the carrying value to $222 million. The

<PAGE> 2
fourth quarter reduction was $500 million which included a successful bulk
sale auction and repayments. The remaining domestic commercial real
estate assets were reduced during the fourth quarter by $699 million to
$4.0 billion. These actions resulted in fourth quarter net pre-tax gains
of $108 million, which included $215 million of gains from assets held for
accelerated disposition, less $107 million of ORE valuation losses and
expenses.
- Chase's cross-border exposure, principally to refinancing countries, was
reduced by approximately $1.3 billion through sales, charge-offs and
valuations to market. These transactions resulted in fourth quarter net
pre-tax losses of $10 million, and net loan charge-offs of $484 million,
which effectively eliminated the reserve applicable to refinancing
countries.
- Total nonaccrual loans were reduced by 47% to $1.1 billion, or less than
1.8% of total loans, resulting in a ratio of reserves to nonaccrual loans
of 135% at December 31, 1993.

CAPITAL
- Tier 1 and total capital ratios improved to 8.4% and 13.2%, respectively. 

OTHER ITEMS
- Charges for business-related investments, which included leasehold write-
offs and other costs associated with updating and expanding dealer trading
activities, particularly in Europe, and costs associated with data center
consolidations and enhanced information systems totaled $45 million.
- On December 31, 1993, Chase adopted SFAS No. 115 entitled, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which resulted in a
net positive impact of $264 million on total stockholders' equity. 
- The adoption of SFAS No. 112 entitled, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," resulted in a charge of $10 million.

Chase President, Arthur F. Ryan added, "Our strong fourth quarter results
reflect the continuing success of our business strategies. The accelerated
liquidation of uneconomic assets frees up resources for investment to achieve
future growth and enhanced productivity. Our improved financial position has
already expanded our market opportunities as is particularly evident in our
trading results."

NET INTEREST REVENUE - TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS
Net interest revenue, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $1,008 million for the
fourth quarter of 1993, up $42 million, or 4%, from $966 million for the fourth
quarter of 1992. Included in the fourth quarter of 1993 net interest revenue
was $21 million from the sale of Argentine past due interest bonds. The fourth
quarter of 1993 net interest margin was 4.33%, compared with 4.31% reported for
the fourth quarter of 1992. Average interest-earning assets for the fourth
quarter of 1993 were $92.4 billion, compared with $89.1 billion for the fourth
quarter of 1992. Average loans decreased to $62.4 billion for the fourth
quarter of 1993 from the $63.1 billion level reported for the fourth quarter
of 1992.

For the full year of 1993, net interest revenue, on a taxable equivalent basis,
was $3,892 million, up $289 million, or 8%, from $3,603 million for the full
year of 1992. The net interest margin was 4.33% for full year 1993, compared
with 4.09% for the full year of 1992. Excluding $163 million of revenue
realized in 1993 from the sales of both Brazilian and Argentine past due
interest bonds, the net interest margin would have been 4.15% for
full year 1993. Average interest-earning assets for the full year of 1993 were
$89.9 billion, compared with $88.1 billion for full year 1992. For full year
1993, average loans decreased to $61.5 billion from the $64.6 billion level
reported for the full year of 1992.

TRADING REVENUE
For the fourth quarter of 1993, total trading revenue of $167 million was $53
million, or 46%, higher than the fourth quarter of 1992. This increase was
primarily the result of strong customer demand across geographic regions for
derivative products as well as emerging markets securities. Total trading
revenue for full year 1993 increased by $248 million, or 53%, from the level
reported for the full year of 1992.

</TABLE> 

FEES AND COMMISSIONS
Fees and commissions for the fourth quarter of 1993 were $401 million, down $16
million from the same period in 1992, primarily due to a decline in consumer
banking fees which reflected $33 million of charges resulting from accelerated
write downs of mortgage servicing assets. Such write downs in the fourth
quarter

<PAGE> 4
of 1993 continue to reflect an industry-wide high level of mortgage refinancing
activity that started to abate during the quarter.

Fee revenue from trust and fiduciary activities for the fourth quarter of 1993
increased 19% over the same period in 1992, reflecting continued growth in
client assets.

OTHER REVENUE
Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $309 million, up $269 million
from the same period in 1992. For the full year of 1993, other revenue was $671
million, or $372 million higher than the $299 million reported for the full year
of 1992.

During the fourth quarter of 1993, Chase continued to reduce its domestic
commercial real estate exposure, particularly the accelerated disposition
portfolio, through sales, including the bulk sale auction of several portfolios,
repayments, and valuation write downs. Other revenue for the fourth quarter of
1993 included $215 million of net gains from assets held for accelerated
disposition.

In addition, the reduction in cross-border exposure resulted in $10 million of
net losses, which reflected net losses of $31 million in other revenue and
interest revenue of $21 million. 

As in prior quarters, other revenue also included gains from the disposition of
corporate finance-related equity investments. For the fourth quarter of 1993,
$110 million of such gains were recognized, compared with $32 million for the
fourth quarter of 1992.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Total operating expenses were $1,199 million for the fourth quarter of 1993 and
$1,019 million for the fourth quarter of 1992. Compared with the same period in
1992, operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 1993 included: $9 million

<PAGE> 5
applicable to the acquisition of Troy and Nichols; $10 million due to the
adoption of SFAS 106; $10 million resulting from the adoption of SFAS 
112; and increased compensation accruals related to higher earnings. In
addition, fourth quarter 1993 operating expenses included $107 million of ORE
valuation losses and expenses, including valuation losses related to ORE
transactions expected to close in 1994. This compared with $36 million of ORE
costs for the fourth quarter of 1992. Fourth quarter 1993 operating expenses
also included $45 million of charges for business-related investments,
including the costs associated with expanding dealer trading activities. 

For the full year of 1993, operating expenses (excluding the first quarter of
1993 provision for ORE held for accelerated disposition) were $4,202 million,
compared with $3,868 million for the full year of 1992. Compared with the full
year of 1992, operating expenses for full year 1993 included: an additional
$91 million of ORE expenses; $41 million of expenses related to SFAS 106;
$10 million of expenses related to SFAS 112; $19 million due to the Troy and
Nichols acquisition; and increased performance related compensation accruals. 
In addition, full year 1993 operating expenses included $45 million of charges
for various business-related investments. 

INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes was $172 million for the fourth quarter of 1993,
representing an effective tax rate of 35%. For the fourth quarter of 1992, the
provision for income taxes was $35 million. The increased tax provision was due
primarily to a higher level of pre-tax income. In addition, fourth quarter 1992
income tax expense reflected the utilization of $37 million of tax benefits
carried forward from prior periods. 

PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES AND NET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS 
For the fourth quarter of 1993, the provision for possible credit losses was
$195 million, or $20 million lower than the third quarter of 1993 and $110
million lower than the fourth quarter of 1992.

Net loan charge-offs, excluding refinancing countries, were $195 million for
fourth quarter 1993, down $106 million from the fourth quarter of 1992. For the
fourth quarter of 1993, domestic commercial real estate net loan charge-offs
declined $85 million and domestic consumer net loan charge-offs declined $9
million from the fourth quarter of 1992. 

For the fourth quarter of 1993, net loan charge-offs applicable to refinancing
countries were $484 million, which were related to the reduction in cross-border
exposure.

DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS - ACCELERATED DISPOSITION PORTFOLIO
During the fourth quarter of 1993, the carrying value of domestic commercial
real estate assets held for accelerated disposition was reduced by
approximately 70% to $222 million primarily through sales and repayments.
Net gains of $215 million were included in other revenue for the fourth
quarter of 1993. At December 31, 1993, the carrying value of the assets held
for accelerated disposition was 38% of their aggregate contractual amount.

</TABLE>

Since taking the disposition action at March 31, 1993, Chase has reduced
assets held for accelerated disposition by approximately 80% through
December 31, 1993. 

CAPITAL
Tier I and total risk-based capital ratios increased to 8.4% and 13.2%,
respectively, at December 31, 1993, primarily as a result of increased retained
earnings. The tier I leverage ratio increased to 7.8% at December 31, 1993. 
Although Chase adopted SFAS 115 on December 31, 1993, which resulted in an
increase to stockholders' equity of $264 million, the risk-based capital ratios
and tier I leverage ratio do not reflect this increase.

In addition, on January 1, 1994, Chase adopted FASB Interpretation 39 (FIN
39), entitled, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts." If Chase
had adopted FIN 39 during the fourth quarter of 1993, total assets and
total liabilities would each have been increased by approximately $10 billion.
The asset-based ratios, including the tier I leverage ratio would have been
lower, although net income and the risk-based capital ratios would not have
been affected.
