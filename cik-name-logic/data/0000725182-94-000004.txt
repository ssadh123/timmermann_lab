Item 5. Other Events

On October 15, 1993, AST Research, Inc. ("Registrant") completed the 
purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of
Tandy/GRiD France, effective as of September 1, 1993. Assets acquired
consist primarily of inventory, personal property, equipment and French 
leased real property. The Registrant intends to utilize the French leased
real property for sales, marketing and administration office space.

The purchase price of $4,716,000 consists of $3,002,000 based on 75% of the
net book value of the purchased assets as of August 31, 1993 less certain
assumed liabilities plus the net book value of the French leased real
property which is priced separately at $1,714,000. In addition, the
original purchase price has been increased by $2,004,000 to account for the
purchase of additional Tandy/GRiD inventory in Europe and other certain
assets in the United States.

The purchase price for the Tandy/GRiD France acquisition and the additional
European inventory and U.S. assets has been paid through a $5,006,000
increase of the principal amount in the three-year promissory note payable 
to Tandy Corporation pursuant to the Agreement for Purchase and Sale of 
Assets, dated as of June 30, 1993, from $90,000,000 to $95,006,000.
The Registrant and Tandy Corporation executed a third amendment to the
promissory note on December 30, 1993 increasing the principal amount by
$1,714,000 from $95,006,000 to $96,720,000 to reflect the purchase price
for the French leased real property, effective July 12, 1993. As a 
result, the letter of credit securing 70% of the face value of the note
has been increased to $67,704,000.
