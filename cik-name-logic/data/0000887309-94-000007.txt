ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

Control Data Systems, Inc. (the "Registrant" or the "Company") has
announced results of its third quarter for fiscal 1994. The Company reported
a third quarter net loss of $5.0 million, or $0.36 per share on revenues of
$113.6 million. This compares to net earnings of $1.0 million, or $.07 per
share, on revenues of $97.1 million for the third quarter of 1993. The
Company also anticipates recording restructuring and asset revaluation
charges of approximately $95 million that will be taken in the fourth
quarter.

The restructuring charges will include expenses for reducing the
worldwide employee population by approximately 600 people and consolidating
operations in selected locations. In addition, related charges will include
the revaluation of intangible assets associated with several acquisitions and
certain proprietary hardware assets. The cash portion of the restructuring
charge will be about half of the total charge.

``
The Company normally experiences revenue and profit weakness in its
third quarter, primarily due to the seasonal slowdown of its European
operations,''
said Joe Killoran, chief financial officer of the Company. ``The
primary factors for the third quarter net loss were the slowdown of our
European operations, shortfalls in our Asian and North American markets, and
margin erosion worldwide. While we did see continued growth in contracts
with major international companies for our electronic messaging solutions,
these factors have not offset the decline in our other sectors.''

``
Our future direction is based on certain key technologies,
particularly in electronic commerce and network reengineering, as well as our
ability to fulfill large, geographically dispersed integration projects,''
said Jim Ousley, president and CEO of the Company. ``
We are focusing our
resource base to align with this direction.

``
We have had to make some difficult decisions in order to transition
our business,''
said Ousley. ``We believe these actions will allow us to more
rapidly complete our transition from a proprietary computer manufacturer into
a systems integration company focused in the rapidly expanding electronic
commerce marketplace.''
