units and lower severance costs. Also during the fourth quarter, $10.5
million was provided in cost of sales to reflect the results of our
continuing review of world-wide assets to identify any permanent declines
in their value as a result of manufacturing productivity improvements and
refinements in the strategic direction of our business units.

(2) Provided for transaction and consolidation charges related to the
acquisition of Revco Scientific, Inc. Prior periods presented were
