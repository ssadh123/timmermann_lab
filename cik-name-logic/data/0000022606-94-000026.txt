Notes to Financial Statements
May 31, 1994

(1) A settlement related to various proceedings and matters affecting the 
Company's rates became final on November 4, 1993. As a result, effective 
as of November 4, 1993, the Company reduced its rates by approximately 
$339 million annually and commenced refunding approximately $1.26 billion 
(including revenue taxes), plus interest at five percent on the unpaid 
balance, through temporarily reduced rates over an initial refund period 
scheduled to be twelve months (to be followed by a reconciliation period 
of no more than five months). The Company had previously deferred the
recognition of revenues during 1993 as a result of developments in one of 
the rate proceedings, which resulted in a reduction to 1993 net income 
of approximately $160 million. The recording of the effects of the 
settlement in October 1993 reduced the Company's 1993 net income and 
retained earnings by approximately $292 million or $1.37 per common 
share, in addition to the effect of the deferred recognition of revenues 
and after the partially offsetting effect of recording approximately $269 
million (or $1.26 per common share) in deferred carrying charges, net of 
income taxes, previously authorized by the Illinois Commerce Commission 
(ICC). The deferred recognition of revenues was eliminated in October 
1993 at the time the provisions for revenue refunds related to the 
settlement, which reflected those deferred revenues, were recorded. 
Consistent with such treatment of the deferred recognition of revenues 
in 1993, the financial statements reflect the reclassification of the 
deferred recognition of revenues from operating revenues to provisions 
for revenue refunds. This reclassification had no effect on net 
electric operating revenues.

A second settlement related to proceedings concerning the Company's fuel 
adjustment clause became final on November 15, 1993. As a result, 
effective as of December 2, 1993, the Company commenced paying 
approximately $108 million (including revenue taxes) to its customers 
through temporarily reduced collections under its fuel adjustment clause 
over a twelve-month period. The Company recorded the effects of that 
settlement in October 1993, which effects reduced the Company's 1993 net 
income and retained earnings by approximately $62 million or $0.29 per 
common share.

(2) As of May 31, 1994, the Company had recorded $31.3 million related to an 
early retirement program announced in February 1994, reflecting the 
employees who elected during March through May of 1994 to take early 
retirement. The effects of that recording reduced the Company's net 
income and retained earnings by approximately $19 million or $0.09 per 
common share.

(3) In May 1994, the Company recorded a reduction in the carrying value of 
its investments in uranium-related properties after completing a review 
of various alternatives and reassessing the long-term recoverability of 
those investments. The effects of the reduction lowered the Company's 
net income and retained earnings by approximately $33.8 million or $0.16 
per common share.
