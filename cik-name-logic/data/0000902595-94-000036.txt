Dear Sirs:

International Lease Finance Corporation, a California
corporation (including its predecessor identified in the
Registration Statement (as defined below), the "Company"),
confirms its agreement with each of you (together with your
affiliates, individually, an "Agent" and collectively, the
"Agents") (which terms shall, for all purposes of this Agreement,
include Lehman Special Securities Inc., an affiliate of Lehman
Brothers Inc.) with respect to the issue and sale by the Company
of up to the aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule I 
hereto of its Medium-Term Notes, Series G, Due from Nine Months 
to Thirty Years from Date of Issue (the "Notes"). The Notes
will be issued under an indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of
November 1, 1991, between the Company and Continental Bank,
National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes will
be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in denominations
exceeding such amount by integral multiples of $1,000, will be
issued only in fully registered form and will bear interest at
rates to be provided in a supplement to the Prospectus referred
to below.

1. Representations and Warranties. The Company
represents and warrants to you as of the date hereof, as of each
Closing Date and Settlement Date hereinafter referred to, and as
of the times referred to in Section 4(h) hereof, as follows:

(a)The Company meets the requirements for use of
Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on
such Form (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule
I hereto), which has become effective, for the registration
under the Act of the aggregate principal amount set forth in
Schedule I hereto of debt securities including the Notes
(the "Securities"). Such registration statement, as amended
at the date of this Agreement, meets the requirements set
forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x) under the Act and complies in all
other material respects with said Rule. In connection with
the sale of Notes the Company proposes to file with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a supplement
to the form of prospectus included in such registration
statement relating to the Notes and the plan of distribution
thereof and has previously advised you of all further
information (financial and other) with respect to the
Company to be set forth therein. Such registration
statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended to the
date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the
"Registration Statement"; such prospectus, as supplemented
pursuant to the previous sentence, is hereinafter called the
"Prospectus". Any reference herein to the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
include the documents incorporated by reference therein
pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), on or before the date of this Agreement or the date
of the Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference
herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement"
with respect to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any
document under the Exchange Act after the date of this
Agreement or the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be,
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

(b)As of the date hereof, when any amendment to
the Registration Statement becomes effective (including the
filing of any document incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement), when any supplement to the
Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at the date of
delivery by the Company of any Notes sold hereunder (a
"Closing Date"), (i) the Registration Statement, as amended
as of any such time, and the Prospectus as supplemented as
of any such time, and the Indenture will comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust
Indenture Act"), and the Exchange Act and the respective
rules thereunder and (ii) neither the Registration
Statement, as amended as of any such time, nor the
Prospectus as supplemented as of any such time, will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading;
provided, however, that the Company makes no representations
or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration
Statement which shall constitute the Statement of
Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust
Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information
contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or
Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by or on
behalf of the Agents specifically for use in connection with
the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus.

(c)Subsequent to the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus, and except as set forth or contemplated in the
Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
has incurred any material liabilities or obligations, direct
or contingent, nor entered into any material transactions
not in the ordinary course of business, and there has not
been any material adverse change in the condition (financial
or otherwise), business, prospects or results of operations
of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole.

(d)The Securities have been duly authorized and,
when issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement and, if
applicable, the Terms Agreement (as defined in Section 2(b)
hereof) or otherwise, will have been duly executed,
authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute
valid and legally binding obligations of the Company
entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, which
will be substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement or a document incorporated by
reference therein; the Indenture has been duly authorized
and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and
constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the
Securities and the Indenture will conform to the
descriptions thereof in the Prospectus.

(e)The Notes have been rated by a "nationally
recognized statistical rating agency" (as that term is
defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2)
under the Act), including one or both of Moody's Investor
Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Corporation.

(f)The Company confirms as of the date hereof,
and each acceptance by the Company of an offer to purchase
Notes will be deemed to be an affirmation, that the Company
is in compliance with all provisions of Section 1 of Laws of
Florida, Chapter 92-198, An Act Relating to Disclosure of
Doing Business with Cuba, and the Company further agrees
that if it commences engaging in business with the
government of Cuba or with any person or affiliate located
in Cuba after the date the Registration Statement becomes or
has become effective with the Commission or with the Florida
Department of Banking and Finance (the "Department"),
whichever date is later, or if the information reported in
the Prospectus, if any, concerning the Company's business
with Cuba or with any person or affiliate located in Cuba
changes in any material way, the Company will provide the
Department notice of such business or change, as
appropriate, in a form acceptable to the Department.

2.Appointment of Agents; Purchases as Principals.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Company hereby authorizes you to act as its
agents to solicit offers for the purchase of all or part of
the Notes, upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus, as
supplemented, during a period beginning on the date hereof
and ending on the date the Company shall specify to you in
writing. The commission to be paid to each Agent in respect
of sales of Notes shall be that percentage specified in
Schedule I hereto of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
sold by the Company in respect of offers to purchase
solicited by each Agent and shall be payable as specified in
the Procedures (as defined in Section 3). Offers for the
purchase of Notes may be solicited by the Agents as agents
for the Company at such time and in such amounts as the
Agents deem advisable. The Company may from time to time
offer Notes for sale otherwise than through the Agents;
provided, however, that so long as this Agreement shall be
in effect, the Company shall not solicit or accept offers to
purchase Notes through any agent at a commission different
from those described in this Agreement for offers to
purchase through the Agents. If any agent, other than an
Agent, is appointed during the term of this Agreement with
respect to the Notes, the Company shall promptly notify the
Agents of such appointment.

(b)Each sale of Notes to you as principal shall
be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a
separate agreement which will provide for the sale of such
Notes to, and the purchase and reoffering thereof by, you. 
Each such separate agreement (which may be an oral agreement
confirmed in writing or which may be substantially in the
form of Schedule II hereto and which may take the form of an
exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication
between you and the Company) is herein referred to as a
"Terms Agreement". Your commitment to purchase Notes
pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been
made on the basis of the representations and warranties of
the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the
terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement
shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be purchased
by you pursuant thereto, the price to be paid to the Company
for such Notes, the initial public offering price, if any,
at which the Notes are proposed to be reoffered, and the
time and place of delivery of and payment for such Notes
(the "Settlement Date"). Such Terms Agreement shall also
specify any requirements for opinions of counsel, officers'
certificates and letters from independent auditors pursuant
to Section 5 hereof.

3.Offering Procedure. The Agents shall communicate
to the Company, orally or in writing, each offer to purchase
Notes on terms previously communicated by the Company to the
Agents, and the Company shall have the sole right to accept such
offers to purchase Notes and may refuse any proposed purchase of
Notes in whole or in part for any reason. Each of the Agents
shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to
reject any proposed purchase of Notes on different terms, as a
whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a
breach of its agreement contained herein. The Agents and the
Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations
specifically provided to be performed by them in the Medium-Term
Notes Administrative Procedures (attached hereto as Exhibit A)
(the "Procedures"), as amended from time to time. The Procedures
may only be amended by written agreement of the Company and the
Agents after notice to, and with the approval of, the Trustee.

4.Agreements. The Company agrees with you that:

(a)Prior to the termination of the offering of
the Notes, the Company will not file any amendment of the
Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus
unless the Company has furnished you with copies for your
review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed
amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. 
Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause
each supplement to the Prospectus to be filed (or trans-
mitted for filing) with the Commission as required pursuant
to Rule 424. The Company will promptly advise you (i) when
each supplement to the Prospectus shall have been filed (or
transmitted for filing) with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424, (ii) when any amendment of the Registration Statement
shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the
Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement
or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any
additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commis-
sion of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of
any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by
the Company of any notification with respect to the suspen-
sion of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any pro-
ceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best
efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and,
if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal
thereof.

(b)If, at any time when a prospectus relating to
the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, any
event occurs as a result of which the Registration
Statement, as then amended, or the Prospectus, as then
supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement
or to supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or
the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the
Company promptly will (i) notify the Agents to suspend
solicitation of offers to purchase Notes (and, if so
notified by the Company, the Agents shall forthwith suspend
such solicitation and cease using the Prospectus as then
amended or supplemented), (ii) prepare and file with the
Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a)
of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will
correct such statement or omission or an amendment or
supplement which will effect such compliance and (iii) will
supply any such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the
Agents in such quantities as the Agents may reasonably
request. If such amendment or supplement is satisfactory in
all respects to the Agents, the Agents will, upon the filing
of such amendment or supplement with the Commission and upon
the effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration
Statement if such an amendment is required, resume their
obligation to solicit offers to purchase Notes hereunder.

(c)As soon as practicable, the Company will make
generally available to its security holders and to you an
earnings statement or statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act and, not later
than 45 days after the end of the 12-month period beginning
at the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company (other than
the last fiscal quarter of any fiscal year) during which the
effective date of any post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement occurs, not later than 90 days after
the end of the fiscal year beginning at the end of each last
fiscal quarter of any fiscal year of the Company during
which the effective date of any post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement occurs, and not later than 90
days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company during
which any Notes were issued, the Company will make generally
available to its security holders an earnings statement
covering such 12-month period or such fiscal year, as the
case may be, that will satisfy the provisions of such
Section 11(a) and Rule 158.

(d)The Company will furnish to you and your
counsel, without charge, copies of the Registration
Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment
thereto which shall become effective and, so long as
delivery of a prospectus may be required by the Act, as many
copies of any preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and
any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as you may
reasonably request.

(e)The Company will arrange for the
qualification of the Notes for sale under the laws of such
jurisdictions as you may reasonably designate, will maintain
such qualifications in effect so long as required for the
distribution of the Notes, and, if requested by the Agents,
will arrange for the determination of the legality of the
Notes for purchase by institutional investors.

(f)The Company shall, whether or not any sale of
the Notes is consummated, (i) pay all expenses incident to
the performance of its obligations under this Agreement,
including the fees and disbursements of its accountants and
counsel, the cost of printing and delivery of the
Registration Statement, any preliminary Prospectus, the
Prospectus, all amendments thereof and supplements thereto,
the Indenture and all other documents relating to the
offering, the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and
delivering the Notes, the fees and disbursements, including
fees of counsel incurred in connection with the
qualification of the Notes for sale and determination of
eligibility for investment of the Notes under the securities
or Blue Sky laws of each such jurisdiction as you may
reasonably designate, the fees and disbursements of the
Trustee and the fees of any agency that rates the Notes, and
(ii) reimburse the Agents on a monthly basis for all
out-of-pocket expenses (including without limitation
advertising expenses) incurred by the Agents and approved by
the Company in advance, in connection with the offering and
the sale of the Notes, and (iii) be responsible for the
reasonable fees of counsel for the Agents incurred in
connection with the offering and sale of the Notes.

(g)Each acceptance by the Company of an offer to
purchase Notes, and each sale of Notes to you pursuant to a
Terms Agreement, will be deemed to be an affirmation that
the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement and in any certificate theretofore
delivered to you pursuant hereto are true and correct at and
as of such date and a representation and warranty to you
that neither the Registration Statement nor the Prospectus,
as then amended or supplemented, fails to reflect any facts
or events which, individually or in the aggregate, represent
a fundamental change in the information set forth in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as then amended or
supplemented, and/or includes any untrue statement of a
material fact, or omits to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except that the foregoing does not apply to (i) that part of
the Registration Statement which shall constitute the
Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under
the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the
information contained in or omitted from the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by you or on
your behalf specifically for use in connection with the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto.

(h)Each time that the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by an
amendment or supplement providing solely for a change in the
interest rates offered on the Notes), or, if so indicated in
the applicable Terms Agreement, the Company sells Notes to
you pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company will deliver
or cause to be delivered forthwith to you a certificate of
the Company signed by the Chairman of the Board or the
President and the principal financial or accounting officer
of the Company, dated the date of the effectiveness of such
amendment or the date of filing of such supplement, in form
reasonably satisfactory to you, to the effect that the
statements contained in the certificate that was last
furnished to you pursuant to either Section 5(e) or this
Section 4(h) are true and correct at the time of the
effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of such
supplement as though made at and as of such time (except
that (i) the last day of the fiscal quarter for which
financial statements of the Company were last filed with the
Commission shall be substituted for the corresponding date
in such certificate and (ii) such statements shall be deemed
to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
as amended and supplemented to the time of the effectiveness
of such amendment or the filing of such supplement) or, in
lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as
the certificate referred to in Section 5(e) but modified to
relate to the last day of the fiscal quarter for which
financial statements of the Company were last filed with the
Commission and to the Registration Statement and the Pro-
spectus as amended and supplemented to the time of the
effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of such
supplement.

(i)Each time that the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by an
amendment or supplement (i) providing solely for a change in
the interest rates offered on the Notes or (ii) setting
forth or incorporating by reference financial statements or
other information as of and for a fiscal quarter, unless, in
the case of clause (ii) above, in your reasonable judgment,
such financial statements or other information are of such a
nature that an opinion of counsel should be furnished), or,
if so indicated in the applicable Terms Agreement, the
Company sells Notes to you pursuant to a Terms Agreement,
the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith
to you a written opinion or opinions of counsel to the
Company satisfactory to you, dated the date of the effec-
tiveness of such amendment or the date of filing of such
supplement, of the same tenor as the opinions referred to in
Sections 5(b) and 5(c) but modified to relate to the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and
supplemented to the time of the effectiveness of such
amendment or the filing of such supplement or, in lieu of
such opinions, counsel last furnishing such an opinion to
you may furnish you with a letter to the effect that you may
rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it
were dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance
(except that statements in such last opinion will be deemed
to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
as amended and supplemented to the time of the effectiveness
of such amendment or the filing of such supplement).

(j) Each time that the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus is amended or supplemented to set forth
amended or supplemental financial information or such
amended or supplemental information is incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus,
or, if so indicated in the applicable Terms Agreement, the
Company sells Notes to you pursuant to a Terms Agreement,
the Company shall cause Ernst & Young, its independent
auditors, forthwith to furnish you a letter, dated the date
of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing
of such supplement, in form satisfactory to you, of the same
tenor as the letter referred to in Section 5(f) with such
changes as may be necessary to reflect the amended and
supplemental financial information included or incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented to the date of such
letter, provided that if the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus is amended or supplemented solely to include or
incorporate by reference financial information as of and for
a fiscal quarter, Ernst & Young may limit the scope of such
letter, which shall be satisfactory in form to you, to the
unaudited financial statements included in such amendment or
supplement, unless any other information included or
incorporated by reference therein of an accounting,
financial or statistical nature is of such a nature that, in
your reasonable judgment, such letter should cover such
other information.

(k)Between the date of any Terms Agreement and
the Settlement Date with respect to such Terms Agreement,
the Company will not, without your prior consent, offer or
sell, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt
securities of the Company, except as may otherwise be
provided in any such Terms Agreement.

5.Conditions to Obligations. Your obligations as
Agents to solicit offers to purchase the Notes and your
obligations to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement or
otherwise shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations
and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of
the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any
amendment to the Registration Statement (including the filing of
any document incorporated by reference therein), as of the date
any supplement to the prospectus is filed with the Commission, as
of each Closing Date and as of each Settlement Date with respect
to any applicable Terms Agreement, to the accuracy of the
statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to
the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(a)No stop order suspending the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement, as amended from time to time,
shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose
shall have been instituted or threatened.

(b)The Company shall have furnished to you the
opinion of corporate counsel for the Company, dated the date
hereof, or of such Settlement Date, if applicable, to the
effect that:

(i)The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good stand-
ing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the
ownership or leasing of its property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified; provided,
however, that the Company may not be so qualified in
certain jurisdictions, the effect of which would not
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

(ii)To the best knowledge of such counsel,
Interlease Aviation Corporation, ILFC Aircraft Holding
Corporation, Interlease Management Corporation,
Aircraft SPC-1, Inc., Aircraft SPC-2, Inc. and Atlantic
International Aviation Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Interlease Management Corporation, are
the only domestic subsidiaries of the Company.

(iii)No subsidiary of the Company nor all of
the subsidiaries of the Company taken as a whole is a
"significant subsidiary" as defined in Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(iv)To the best knowledge of such counsel,
there is no pending or threatened action, suit or
proceeding before any court or governmental agency,
authority or body or any arbitrator involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries of a character
required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement
which is not adequately disclosed in the Prospectus.

(c)The Company shall have furnished to you the
opinion of O'Melveny & Myers, special counsel for the
Company, dated the date hereof, or of such Settlement Date,
if applicable, to the effect that:

(i)Each of the Company and its domestic
subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is incorporated.

(ii)Each of the Company and its domestic
subsidiaries has the corporate power to own its
properties and conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus.

(iii)The Indenture has been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and is a legally valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by bank-
ruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or simi-
lar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and
except that such counsel may advise that the
enforceability of the Indenture is subject to the
effect of general principles of equity including,
without limitation, concepts of materiality,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the
possible unavailability of specific performance or
injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law, and, if applicable,
is subject to provisions of law which may require that
a judgment for money damages rendered by a court in the
United States be expressed in United States dollars.

(iv)The Notes have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and when the final terms of a particular Note
and of its issuance and sale have been duly established
in conformity with the Indenture, and when such Note
has been duly executed, authenticated and issued in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and
upon payment for and delivery of the Notes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be
legally valid and binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms, except as limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and except that
such counsel may advise that the enforceability of the
Notes is subject to the effect of general principles of
equity including, without limitation, concepts of
materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair
dealing and the possible unavailability of specific
performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and, if
applicable, is subject to provisions of law which may
require that a judgment for money damages rendered by a
court in the United States be expressed in United
States dollars.

(v)The Indenture has been duly qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act.

(vi)This Agreement (and if the opinion is
being furnished on a Settlement Date, the applicable
Terms Agreement) has been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company
and has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company.

(vii)No consent, authorization, order or
approval of any California, New York or federal court
or governmental agency or body is required on the part
of the Company for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or for the issuance and sale of the Notes,
except such as have been obtained under the Act, the
Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under
the Blue Sky or securities laws of any jurisdiction and
such other approvals (specified in such opinion) as
have been obtained.

(viii)Neither the execution and delivery of
the Indenture nor the issuance of the Notes will
conflict with, result in a breach by the Company or any
of its domestic subsidiaries of, or constitute a
default under, the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
of the Company or its domestic subsidiaries or the
terms of any of the agreements, instruments, contracts,
orders, injunctions or judgments identified to such
counsel in an Officer's Certificate of the Company (a
copy of which will be delivered with the opinion of
such counsel) as agreements, instruments, contracts,
orders, injunctions or judgments binding on the Company
which have provisions relating to the issuance by the
Company of debt securities and the breach of or default
under or a conflict with which would have a material
adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as a whole, except that no opinion need be
expressed regarding the effect, if any, of the issuance
of the Notes upon the Company's compliance with any of
the financial covenants contained in any of said
agreements, instruments, contracts, orders, injunctions
or judgements.

(ix)The Registration Statement has been
declared effective under the Act and, to such counsel's
knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement has been issued or
threatened by the Commission.

(x)The Registration Statement, on the date
it was filed, appeared on its face to comply in all
material respects with the requirements as to form for
registration statements on Form S-3 under the Act and
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder,
except that no opinion need be expressed concerning the
financial statements and other financial and
statistical information contained or incorporated by
reference therein.

(xi)Such counsel does not know of any
material contract or other material document of a
character required to be filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement or required to be described in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which is
not filed or described as required.

(xii)The documents incorporated by reference
into the Prospectus (the "Incorporated Documents")
appear on their face to comply in all material respects
with the requirements as to form for reports on Form
10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, as the case may be, under
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder in effect at the respective dates of their
filing, except that no opinion need be expressed
concerning the financial statements and other financial
and statistical information contained or incorporated
by reference therein.

(xiii)The statements in the Prospectus under
the caption "Description of Debt Securities", and in
the Prospectus Supplement under the caption
"Description of Medium-Term Notes, Series G", insofar
as such statements constitute a summary of provisions
of the Indenture or the Notes, fairly present the
information required therein by Form S-3.

(xiv)The purchase and sale of the Notes in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, the Indenture and
the Notes will not violate the provisions of Section 1
of Article XV of the Constitution of the State of
California.

(xv)The Company is not an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended.

Such counsel shall also state that on the basis of
their review of the Registration Statement, the documents
incorporated therein on the effective date of the Registra-
tion Statement, the Prospectus and the Incorporated Docu-
ments, and their participation in conferences in connection
with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, they do not believe that the Registration State-
ment and the documents incorporated therein on the date the
Registration Statement became effective (or if later, the
date the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K was
filed with the Commission), considered as a whole as of such
date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and they do not believe that the Prospectus and
the Incorporated Documents, considered as a whole on the
date of the Final Prospectus and on the date of the opinion,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 
Such counsel need not express any opinion or belief as to
any document filed by the Company under the Exchange Act,
whether prior or subsequent to the effective date of the
Registration Statement, except to the extent that any such
document is an Incorporated Document read together with the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus and considered as a
whole and as specifically stated in clause (xii) above, nor
must such counsel express any opinion or belief as to the
Form T-1 filed by the Trustee in connection with the Notes
or the financial statements and other financial and
statistical information included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or
the Incorporated Documents.

(d)You shall have received from Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley & McCloy, your counsel, such opinion or opinions,
dated the date hereof, or of such Settlement Date, if
applicable, with respect to the issuance and sale of the
Notes, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus and other related matters as you may reasonably
require, and the Company shall have furnished to such
counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of
enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(e)The Company shall have furnished to you a
certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the
Board or the President and the principal financial or
accounting officer of the Company, dated the date hereof, or
of such Settlement Date, if applicable, to the effect that
the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus and this Agreement
and that:

(i)the representations and warranties of
the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in
all material respects on and as of the date hereof, or
of such Settlement Date, if applicable, with the same
effect as if made on the date hereof, or of such
Settlement Date, if applicable, and the Company has, in
all material respects, complied with all the agreements
and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be
performed or satisfied as a condition to your
obligation as Agents to solicit offers to purchase the
Notes, or your obligation to purchase Notes pursuant to
any Terms Agreement;

(ii)no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been
issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been
instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened;
and

(iii)since the date of the most recent
financial statements included in the Prospectus, there
has been no material adverse change in the condition
(financial or other), earnings, business or properties
of the Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not
arising from transactions in the ordinary course of
business, except as set forth or contemplated in the
Prospectus.

(f)At the date hereof, or of such Settlement
Date, if applicable, Ernst & Young shall have furnished to
you a letter or letters (which may refer to letters
previously delivered to you), dated as of the date hereof,
or of such Settlement Date, if applicable, in form and
substance satisfactory to you, confirming that they are
independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and
the Exchange Act and the respective applicable published
rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:

(i)in their opinion the audited financial
statements and financial statement schedules included
or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus and reported on by them comply in form in
all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the
related published rules and regulations;

(ii)on the basis of a reading of the latest
unaudited financial statements made available by the
Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain
specified procedures (but not any examination in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards)
which would not necessarily reveal matters of signifi-
cance with respect to the comments set forth in such
letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the
shareholders, directors and audit committees of the
Company and the subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain
officials of the Company who have responsibility for
financial and accounting matters of the Company and its
subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent
to the date of the most recent audited financial
statements included or incorporated in the Prospectus,
nothing came to their attention which caused them to
believe that:

(1)any unaudited financial statements
included or incorporated in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus do not comply in form
in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the Commission with
respect to financial statements included or
incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited
financial statements are not in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a basis substantially consistent with that of
the audited financial statements included or
incorporated in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus;

(2)with respect to the period
subsequent to the date of the most recent
financial statements (other than any capsule
information), audited or unaudited, in or
incorporated in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified
date not more than five business days prior to the
date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the
Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of
the Company or decreases in the shareholders'
equity of the Company as compared with the amounts
shown on the most recent consolidated balance
sheet included or incorporated in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus, or for the period
from the date of the most recent financial
statements included or incorporated in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus to such
specified date there were any decreases, as
compared with the corresponding period in the
preceding year, in consolidated revenues or in
total amounts of net income of the Company and its
subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes
or decreases set forth in such letter, in which
case the letter shall be accompanied by an
explanation by the Company as to the significance
thereof unless said explanation is not deemed
necessary by the Agents; or

(3)the amounts included in any
unaudited "capsule" information included or
incorporated in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth
in the unaudited financial statements for the same
periods or were not determined on a basis
substantially consistent with that of the
corresponding amounts in the audited financial
statements included or incorporated in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus;

(iii)they have performed certain other
specified procedures as a result of which they
determined that certain information of an accounting,
financial or statistical nature (which is limited to
accounting, financial or statistical information
derived from the general accounting records of the
Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus and in
Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the
information included or incorporated in Items 1, 2, 6,
7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K,
incorporated in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, and the information included in the
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" included or
incorporated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q, incorporated in the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of
the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any
questions of legal interpretation; and

(iv)if pro forma financial statements are
included or incorporated in the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus, on the basis of a reading of the
unaudited pro forma financial statements, carrying out
certain specified procedures, inquiries of certain
officials of the Company who have responsibility for
financial and accounting matters, and proving the
arithmetic accuracy of the application of the pro forma
adjustments to the historical amounts in the pro forma
financial statements, nothing came to their attention
which caused them to believe that the pro forma
financial statements do not comply in form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X or that
the pro forma adjustments have not been properly
applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of
such statements.

References to the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus in this paragraph (f) are to such documents as
amended and supplemented at the date of the letter.

(g)Subsequent to the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or
decrease specified in the letter referred to in paragraph
(f) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development
involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business
or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries the effect
of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
above, is, in your judgment, so material and adverse as to
make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the
purchase or soliciting of offers to purchase the Notes as
contemplated by the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus.

(h)Prior to the date hereof, the Company shall
have furnished you such further information, certificates
and documents as you may reasonably request.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5
shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and
as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and
certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to you and your counsel, this Agreement and all of
your obligations hereunder may be canceled at any time by you. 
Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in
writing or by telephone or telecopy confirmed in writing.

The documents required to be delivered by this Section
5 shall be delivered at the office of O'Melveny & Myers at 400
South Hope Street, Los Angeles, California, on the date hereof.

6.Reimbursement of Expenses. If any condition to
your obligations set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied,
if any termination pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall occur or in
the case of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the
Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any
provision hereof other than by reason of a default by you, the
Company will reimburse you upon demand for all out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel)
that you shall have incurred in connection with this Agreement.

7.Indemnification and Contribution.

(a)The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each of you and each person, if any, who controls
each of you within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act as
follows:

(i)against any and all loss, liability,
claim, damage and expense whatsoever arising out of any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Registration Statement
(or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission
therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, unless such untrue statement or such
alleged untrue statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by you expressly
for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto);

(ii)against any and all loss, liability
claim, damage and expense whatsoever to the extent of
the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any
litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened,
or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished by you as
aforesaid) if such settlement is effected with the
written consent of the Company; and

(iii)against any and all expense whatsoever
as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of
counsel chosen by you) reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any
litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened,
or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
statement or omission (except as made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished by you as
aforesaid), to the extent that any such expense is not
paid under (i) or (ii) above.

(b)Each of you agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers
who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if
any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section
15 of the Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,
damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in
subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to
untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements
or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by you
expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto).

(c)Each indemnified party shall give prompt
notice to each indemnifying party of any action commenced
against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder but failure to so notify an indemnifying party
shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have
otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In
case any such action shall be brought against any
indemnified party, the indemnifying party may participate at
its own expense in the defense of such action. In no event
shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel (other than local counsel)
for all indemnified parties in connection with any one
action or separate but similar or related actions in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances. The indemnifying party shall
not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its written consent, but if settled with such
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff,
the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified
party to the extent set forth in subsection (a) or (b)
hereof, as applicable, from and against any loss or
liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No
indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent
of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
indemnified party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such indemnified party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such
proceeding.

(d)If the indemnification provided for in this
Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to an
indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof in
respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any
action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable
by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim,
damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in
such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand,
and the Agents, on the other, from the offering of the Notes
or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is
not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault
of the Company, on the one hand, and the Agents, on the
other, with respect to the statements or omissions which
resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action
in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Company, on the one hand, and the Agents, on the other, with
respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of
the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the
Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received
by any Agent with respect to such offering. The relative
fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company or any Agent, the intent
of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The Company and the Agents agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro
rata allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss,
claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof,
referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to
include, for purposes of this Section 7(d), any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party
in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim to the extent not already paid or payable
pursuant to another provision of this Section 7. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no
Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes
sold through any Agent and distributed to the public were
offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages
which any Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay
by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations under this
Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to the
respective principal amounts of Notes purchased by each such
Agent and not joint.

8. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated for
any reason, at any time by any party hereto, with respect to such
party, upon the giving of 30 days written notice of such
termination to the other parties hereto. You may also terminate
any Terms Agreement, immediately upon notice to the Company, at
any time prior to the Settlement Date if any of the following
shall have occurred: (i) since the respective dates as of which
information is given in the Registration Statement, any material
adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the
Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, or in
the earnings, affairs or business prospects of the Company and
its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not
arising in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth
or contemplated in the Prospectus, which, in your reasonable
judgement, makes it impracticable to market the Notes or enforce
contracts for the sale of Notes, (ii) trading in any securities
of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national
securities exchange, or trading generally on either the New York
Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange shall have been
suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have
been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall
have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of
the Commission or any other governmental authority, (iii) a
banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or
New York State authorities, (iv) any outbreak or escalation of
hostilities or other national or international calamity or
crisis, if the effect of such outbreak, escalation, calamity or
crisis would, in your reasonable judgment, make the offering or
delivery of the Notes impracticable, or (v) any decrease in the
ratings of any of the Company's debt securities by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation or
either of said organizations shall publicly announce that it has
under consideration or review with negative implications any of
the Company's debt securities. In the event of any such
termination, neither party will have any liability to the other
party hereto, except that (i) the Agents shall be entitled to any
commissions earned in accordance with Section 2(a) hereof, (ii)
if at the time of termination (A) the Agent shall own any of the
Notes acquired pursuant to a Terms Agreement with the intention
of reselling them or (B) an offer to purchase any of the Notes
has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the
purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has
not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 3, 4 and 6
hereof shall remain in effect until such Notes are so resold or
delivered, as the case may be, and (iii) the covenants set forth
in Sections 4(c) and 4(f) hereof, the indemnity agreement set
forth in Section 7 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 9 and
12 hereof shall remain in effect.

The Company also agrees to offer to any person who has
agreed to purchase Notes as a result of an offer to purchase
solicited by any Agent the right to refuse to purchase and pay
for such Notes if, on the related Settlement Date fixed pursuant
to the Procedures, any of the following events has occurred: 
(i) since the respective dates as of which information is given
in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the
condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, or in the earnings,
affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the
ordinary course of business, which materially impairs the
investment quality of the Notes; (ii) any decrease in the ratings
of the Notes by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &
Poor's Corporation or either of said organizations shall publicly
announce that it has under consideration or review with negative
implications any of the Company's debt securities; (iii) trading
in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the
Commission or a national securities exchange, or trading
generally on either the New York Stock Exchange or the American
Stock Exchange shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum
prices for trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for
prices for securities shall have been required, by either of said
exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental
authority; (iv) a banking moratorium shall have been declared
either by federal or New York state authorities; or (v) any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or
international calamity or crises, if the effect of any such event
specified in clauses (iii), (iv) or (v) make it impracticable to
proceed with the sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and
in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

9.Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The
respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities
and other statements of the Company, its officers and you set
forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agree-
ment will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any

Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for
the Notes. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall
survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

respective successors and the officers and directors and con-
trolling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other
person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

EXHIBIT A

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEDURES FOR FIXED RATE AND FLOATING RATE NOTES
(Dated as of May 17, 1994)

Medium-Term Notes, Series G (the "Notes"), in the
aggregate principal amount of up to U.S. $500,000,000 are to be
offered on a continuing basis by International Lease Finance
Corporation (the "Company") through Lehman Brothers Inc., Merrill
Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Salomon Brothers Inc and
Goldman, Sachs & Co., who, as agents (each an "Agent," and,
collectively, the "Agents"), have agreed to use their best
efforts to solicit offers to purchase the Notes from the Company. 
The Agents may also purchase Notes as principal for resale.

The Notes are being sold pursuant to a Distribution 
Agreement between the Company and the Agents, dated May 17, 1994
(the "Distribution Agreement"). The Notes will be issued 
pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 1, 1991,
between the Company and Continental Bank, National Association,
as trustee (the "Trustee"). A Registration Statement (the
"Registration Statement", which term shall include any additional
registration statements filed in connection with the Notes as
provided in the introductory paragraph of the Distribution
Agreement) with respect to the Notes has been filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). The most
recent basic Prospectus included in the Registration Statement,
as supplemented with respect to the Notes, is herein referred to as
the "Prospectus Supplement." The most recent supplement to the
Prospectus with respect to the specific terms of the Notes is
herein referred to as the "Pricing Supplement."

The Notes will either be issued (a) in book-entry form
and represented by one or more fully registered Notes (each, a
"Book-Entry Note") delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the book-entry
system maintained by DTC, or (b) in certificated form delivered
to the purchaser thereof or a person designated by such purchaser. 
Owners of beneficial interests in Notes issued in book-entry form
will be entitled to physical delivery of Notes in certificated
form equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial
interests only upon certain limited circumstances described in the
Prospectus.

General procedures relating to the issuance of all
Notes are set forth in Part I hereof. Additionally, Notes issued in
book-entry form will be issued in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Part II hereof and Notes issued in certificated form
will be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Part III hereof. Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture
or the Notes, as the case may be.

PART I: PROCEDURES OF GENERAL
APPLICABILITY

Date of Issuance/
Authentication: Each Note will be dated as of the date of its
authentication by the Trustee. Each Note
shall also bear an original issue date (the
"Original Issue Date"). The Original Issue
Date shall remain the same for all Notes
subsequently issued upon transfer, exchange or
substitution of an original Note regardless of
their dates of authentication.

Maturities: Each Note will mature on a date selected by
the purchaser and agreed to by the Company
which is not less than nine months nor more
than thirty years from its Original Issue
Date; provided, however, that Notes bearing
interest at rates determined by reference to
selected indices ("Floating Rate Notes") will
mature on an Interest Payment Date.

Registration: Notes will be issued only in fully registered
form.
Calculation of
Interest: In the case of Notes bearing interest at fixed
rates ("Fixed Rate Notes") interest (including
payments for partial periods) will be
calculated and paid on the basis of a 360-day
year of twelve 30-day months. In the case of
Floating Rate Notes, interest will be
calculated and paid on the basis of the actual
number of days in the interest period divided
by 360 for Commercial Paper Rate, Federal
Funds Rate, Prime Rate, LIBOR Notes and LIBID
Notes and on the basis of the actual number of
days in the interest period divided by the
actual number of days in the year for Treasury
Rate Notes.
Acceptance and
Rejection of 
Offers: The Company shall have the sole right to
accept offers to purchase Notes from the
Company and may reject any such offer in whole
or in part. Each Agent shall communicate to
the Company, orally or in writing, each
reasonable offer to purchase Notes from the
Company received by it. Each Agent shall have
the right, in its discretion reasonably
exercised, without notice to the Company, to
reject any offer to purchase Notes through it
in whole or in part.

Preparation 
of Pricing
Supplement: If any offer to purchase a Note is accepted by
the Company, the Company, with the assistance
of the Agent which presented such offer (the
"Presenting Agent"), will prepare a Pricing
Supplement reflecting the terms of such Note
and file 10 Pricing Supplements relating to
the Notes and the plan of distribution
thereof, if changed (the "Supplemented
Prospectus"), with the Commission in
accordance with Rule 424 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The
Presenting Agent will cause a stickered
Supplemented Prospectus to be delivered to the
purchaser of the Note.

In addition, the Company shall deliver each
completed Pricing Supplement, via next day
mail or telecopy to arrive no later than 11:00
A.M. on the Business Day following the trade
date, to the Presenting Agent at the following

Supplement to Supplemented Prospectuses prior
to their use. Outdated Pricing Supplements,
and the Supplemented Prospectuses to which
they are attached (other than those retained
for files) will be destroyed.

Settlement: The receipt of immediately available funds by
the Company in payment for a Note and the
authentication and delivery of such Note
shall, with respect to such Note, constitute
"settlement." Offers accepted by the Company
will be settled from three to five Business
Days after the Company's acceptance of the
offer, or at a time as the purchaser and the
Company shall agree, pursuant to the timetable
for settlement set forth in Parts II and III
hereof under "Settlement Procedures" with
respect to Book-Entry Notes and Certificated
Notes, respectively. If procedures A and B of
the applicable Settlement Procedures with
respect to a particular offer are not

under the applicable "Settlement Procedures
Timetable," such offer shall not be settled
until the Business Day following the
completion of settlement procedures A and B or
such later date as the purchaser and the
Company shall agree.

In the event of a purchase of Notes by any
Agent as principal, appropriate settlement
details will be as agreed between the Agent
and the Company pursuant to the applicable
Terms Agreement.

Procedure for 
Changing Rates 
or Other
Variable Terms: When a decision has been reached to change the
interest rate or any other variable term on
any Notes being sold by the Company, the
Company will promptly advise the Agents and
the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation
of offers to purchase such Notes. The Agents
will telephone the Company with recommenda-
tions as to the changed interest rates or
other variable terms. At such time as the
Company advises the Agents of the new interest
rates or other variable terms, the Agents may
resume solicitation of offers to purchase such
Notes. Until such time only "indications of
interest" may be recorded. Immediately after
acceptance by the Company of an offer to
purchase at a new interest rate or new
variable term, the Company, the Presenting
Agent and the Trustee shall follow the
procedures set forth under the applicable
"Settlement Procedures."

Suspension of
Solicitation;
Amendment
or Supplement: The Company may instruct the Agents to suspend
solicitation of purchases at any time. Upon
receipt of such instructions the Agents will
forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to
purchase from the Company until such time as
the Company has advised them that solicitation
of offers to purchase may be resumed. If the
Company decides to amend the Registration
Statement (including incorporating any
documents by reference therein) or supplement
any of such documents (other than to change
rates or other variable terms), it will
promptly advise the Agents and will furnish
the Agents and their counsel with copies of
the proposed amendment (including any document
proposed to be incorporated by reference
therein) or supplement. One copy of such
filed document, along with a copy of the cover
letter sent to the Commission, will be
delivered or mailed to the Agents at the
following respective addresses:

In the event that at the time the solicitation
of offers to purchase from the Company is
suspended (other than to change interest rates
or other variable terms) there shall be any
orders outstanding which have not been
settled, the Company will promptly advise the
Agents and the Trustee whether such orders may
be settled and whether copies of the
Prospectus as theretofore amended and/or
supplemented as in effect at the time of the
suspension may be delivered in connection with
the settlement of such orders. The Company
will have the sole responsibility for such
decision and for any arrangements which may be
made in the event that the Company determines
that such orders may not be settled or that
copies of such Prospectus may not be so
delivered.
Delivery of
Prospectus: A copy of the most recent Prospectus,
Prospectus Supplement and Pricing Supplement
must accompany or precede the earlier of (a)
the written confirmation of a sale sent to a
customer or his agent and (b) the delivery of
Notes to a customer or his agent.
Authenticity of
Signatures: The Agents will have no obligations or
liability to the Company or the Trustee in
respect of the authenticity of the signature
of any officer, employee or agent of the
Company or the Trustee on any Note.

Documents 
Incorporated
by Reference: The Company shall supply the Agents with an
adequate supply of all documents incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement.

Business Day: "Business Day" means any day that is not a
Saturday or Sunday, and that, in The City of
New York (and with respect to LIBOR Notes, the
City of London), is not a day on which banking
institutions are generally obligated or
authorized by law to close.

PART II: PROCEDURES FOR NOTES ISSUED
IN BOOK-ENTRY FORM

In connection with the qualification of Notes issued in book-
entry form for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by
DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and
administrative functions described below, in accordance with its
respective obligations under a Letter of Representation from the
Company and the Trustee to DTC (the "Certificate Agreement"), and
its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day
Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").

Issuance: All Fixed Rate Notes issued in book-entry form
having the same Original Issue Date, interest
rate and Stated Maturity (collectively, the
"Fixed Rate Terms") will be represented
initially by a single global security in fully
registered form without coupons (each, a
"Book-Entry Note"); and all Floating Rate
Notes issued in book-entry form having the
same Original Issue Date, base rate upon which
interest may be determined (each, a "Base
Rate"), which may be the Commercial Paper
Rate, the Treasury Rate, LIBOR, LIBID, the CD
Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, the Prime Rate,
any other rate set forth by the Company,
Initial Interest Rate, Index Maturity, Spread
or Spread Multiplier, if any, the minimum
interest rate, if any, the maximum interest
rate, if any, and the Stated Maturity
(collectively, "Floating Rate Terms") will be
represented initially by a single Book-Entry
Note.

Each Book-Entry Note will be dated and issued
as of the date of its authentication by the
Trustee. Each Book-Entry Note will bear an
Interest Accrual Date, which will be (a) with
respect to an original Book-Entry Note (or any
portion thereof), its Original Issue Date and
(b) with respect to any Book-Entry Note (or
portion thereof) issued subsequently upon
exchange of a Book-Entry Note or in lieu of a
destroyed, lost or stolen Book-Entry Note, the
most recent Interest Payment Date to which
interest has been paid or duly provided for on
the predecessor Book-Entry Note or Notes (or
if no such payment or provision has been made,
the original Issue Date of the predecessor
Book-Entry Note or Notes), regardless of the
date of authentication of such subsequently
issued Book-Entry Note. No Book-Entry Note
shall represent any Note issued in
certificated form.

Identification: The Company has arranged with the CUSIP
Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's
Corporation (the "CUSIP Service Bureau") for
the reservation of approximately 900 CUSIP
numbers which have been reserved for and
relating to Book-Entry Notes and the Company
has delivered to the Trustee and DTC such list
of such CUSIP numbers. The Company will
assign CUSIP numbers to Book-Entry Notes as
described below under Settlement Procedure B.

DTC will notify the CUSIP Service Bureau
periodically of the CUSIP numbers that the
Company has assigned to Book-Entry Notes. The
Trustee will notify the Company at any time
when fewer than 100 of the reserved CUSIP
numbers remain unassigned to Book-Entry Notes,
and, if it deems necessary, the Company will
reserve additional CUSIP numbers for
assignment to Book-Entry Notes. Upon
obtaining such additional CUSIP numbers, the
Company will deliver a list of such additional
numbers to the Trustee and DTC. Book-Entry
Notes having an aggregate principal amount in
excess of $150,000,000 and otherwise required
to be represented by the same Global
Certificate will instead be represented by two
or more Global Certificates which shall all be
assigned the same CUSIP number.

Registration: Each Book-Entry Note will be registered in the
name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, on the
register maintained by the Trustee under the
Indenture. The beneficial owner of a Note
issued in book-entry form (i.e., an owner of a
beneficial interest in a Book-Entry Note) (or
one or more indirect participants in DTC
designated by such owner) will designate one
or more participants in DTC (with respect to
such Note issued in book-entry form, the
"Participants") to act as agent for such
beneficial owner in connection with the book-
entry system maintained by DTC, and DTC will
record in book-entry form, in accordance with
instructions provided by such Participants, a
credit balance with respect to such Note
issued in book-entry form in the account of
such Participants. The ownership interest of
such beneficial owner in such Note issued in
book-entry form will be recorded through the
records of such Participants or through the
separate records of such Participants and one
or more indirect participants in DTC.

Transfers: Transfers of a Book-Entry Note will be
accomplished by book entries made by DTC and,
in turn, by Participants (and in certain
cases, one or more indirect participants in
DTC) acting on behalf of beneficial
transferors and transferees of such Book-Entry
Note.

Exchanges: The Trustee may deliver to DTC and the CUSIP
Service Bureau at any time a written notice
specifying (a) the CUSIP numbers of two or
more Book-Entry Notes Outstanding on such date
that represent Book-Entry Notes having the
same Fixed Rate Terms or Floating Rate Terms,
as the case may be, (other than Original Issue
Dates) and for which interest has been paid to
the same date; (b) a date, occurring at least
30 days after such written notice is delivered
and at least 30 days before the next Interest
Payment Date for the related Notes issued in
book-entry form, on which such Book-Entry
Notes shall be exchanged for a single
replacement Book-Entry Note; and (c) a new
CUSIP number, obtained from the Company, to be
assigned to such replacement Book-Entry Note.

Upon receipt of such a notice, DTC will send
to its participants (including the Trustee) a
written reorganization notice to the effect
that such exchange will occur on such date. 
Prior to the specified exchange date, the
Trustee will deliver to the CUSIP Service
Bureau written notice setting forth such
exchange date and the new CUSIP number and
stating that, as of such exchange date, the
CUSIP numbers of the Book-Entry Notes to be
exchanged will no longer be valid. On the
specified exchange date, the Trustee will
exchange such Book-Entry Notes for a single
Book-Entry Note bearing the new CUSIP number
and the CUSIP numbers of the exchanged Book-
Entry Notes will, in accordance with CUSIP
Service Bureau procedures, be cancelled and
not immediately reassigned. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Book-Entry Notes to be
exchanged exceed $150,000,000 in aggregate
principal amount, one replacement Book-Entry
Note will be authenticated and issued to
represent $150,000,000 of principal amount of
the exchanged Book-Entry Notes and an
additional Book-Entry Note or Notes will be
authenticated and issued to represent any
remaining principal amount of such Book-Entry
Notes (See "Denominations" below).

Denominations: All Notes issued in book-entry form will be
denominated in U.S. dollars. Notes issued in
book-entry form will be issued in
denominations of $1,000 and any larger
denomination which is an integral multiple of
$1,000. Book-Entry Notes will be denominated
in principal amounts not in excess of
$150,000,000. If one or more Notes issued in
book-entry form having an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $150,000,000 would, but
for the preceding sentence, be represented by
a single Book-Entry Note, then one Book-Entry
Note will be issued to represent $150,000,000
principal amount of such Note or Notes issued
in book-entry form and an additional Book-
Entry Note or Notes will be issued to
represent any remaining principal amount of
such Note or Notes issued in book-entry form.

In such a case, each of the Book-Entry Notes
representing such Note or Notes issued in
book-entry form shall be assigned the same
CUSIP number.

Interest: General. Interest on each Note issued in
book-entry form will accrue from the Interest
Accrual Date of the Book-Entry Note
representing such Note. Each payment of
interest on a Note issued in book-entry form
will include interest accrued through and
including the day preceding, as the case may
be, the Interest Payment Date (provided that
in the case of Floating Rate Notes which reset
weekly, interest payments will include
interest accrued to and including the Regular
Record Date immediately preceding the Interest
Payment Date), or the Stated Maturity (each
Stated Maturity or earlier redemption or
repayment is referred to herein as a
"Maturity"). Interest payable at Maturity of
a Note issued in book-entry form will be
payable to the Person to whom the principal of
such Note is payable. DTC will arrange for
each pending deposit message described under
Settlement Procedure C below to be transmitted
to Standard & Poor's which will use the
information in the message to include certain
terms of the related Book-Entry Note in the
appropriate daily bond report published by
Standard & Poor's.

Regular Record Dates. Unless otherwise
specified in the applicable Pricing
Supplement, the Regular Record Date with
respect to any Interest Payment Date for a
Fixed Rate Note shall be the close of business
on the date 15 calendar days (whether or not a
Business Day) preceding such Interest Payment
Date. The Regular Record Date with respect to
any Interest Payment Date for a Floating Rate
Note shall be the close of business on the
date 15 calendar days (whether or not a
Business Day) preceding such Interest Payment
Date.

Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments
will be made on each Interest Payment Date
commencing with the first Interest Payment
Date following the Original Issue Date;
provided, however, the first payment of
interest on any Book-Entry Note originally
issued between a Regular Record Date and an
Interest Payment Date will occur on the
Interest Payment Date following the next
Regular Record Date.

If an Interest Payment Date with respect to
any Floating Rate Note issued in book-entry
form would otherwise fall on a day that is not
a Business Day with respect to such Note, such
Interest Payment Date will be the following
day that is a Business Day with respect to
such Note, except that in the case of a LIBOR
or LIBID Note, if such day falls in the next
calendar month, such Interest Payment Date
will be the preceding day that is a London
Business Day.

Fixed Rate Notes. Unless otherwise specified
in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest
payments on Fixed Rate Notes issued in book-
entry form will be made semi-annually on April
15 and October 15 of each year and at
Maturity.

Floating Rate Notes. Interest payments on
Floating Rate Notes issued in book-entry form
will be made as specified in the Floating Rate
Note.

Notice of Interest Payments and Regular Record
Dates. On the first Business Day of March,
June, September and December of each year, the
Trustee will deliver to the Company and DTC a
written list of Regular Record Dates and
Interest Payment Dates that will occur during
the six-month period beginning on such first
Business Day with respect to Floating Rate
Notes issued in book-entry form. Promptly
after each Interest Determination Date for
Floating Rate Notes issued in book-entry form,
the Trustee will notify Standard & Poor's of
the interest rates determined on such Interest
Determination Date.
Payments of 
Principal and
Interest: Payments of Interest Only. Promptly after
each Regular Record Date, the Trustee will
deliver to the Company and DTC a written
notice specifying by CUSIP number the amount
of interest to be paid on each Book-Entry Note
on the following Interest Payment Date (other
than an Interest Payment Date coinciding with
Maturity) and the total of such amounts. DTC
will confirm the amount payable on each Book-
Entry Note on such Interest Payment Date by
referring to the daily bond reports published
by Standard & Poor's. On such Interest
Payment Date, the Company will pay to the
Trustee, and the Trustee in turn will pay to
DTC, such total amount of interest due (other
than at Maturity), at the times and in the
manner set forth below under "Manner of
Payment".

Payments at Maturity. On or about the first
Business Day of each month, the Trustee will
deliver to the Company and DTC a written list
of principal, interest and premium, if any, to 
be paid on each Book-Entry Note maturing
either at Stated Maturity or on a Redemption
Date in the following month. The Trustee, the
Company and DTC will confirm the amounts of
such principal and interest payments with
respect to a Book-Entry Note on or about the
fifth Business Day preceding the Maturity of
such Book-Entry Note. At such Maturity the
Company will pay to the Trustee, and the
Trustee in turn will pay to DTC, the principal
amount of such Note, together with interest
and premium, if any, due at such Maturity, at
the times and in the manner set forth below
under "Manner of Payment". If any Maturity of
a Book-Entry Note is not a Business Day, the
payment due on such day shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day and no interest
shall accrue on such payment for the period
from and after such Maturity. Promptly after
payment to DTC of the principal, interest and
premium, if any, due at the Maturity of such
Book-Entry Note, the Trustee will cancel such
Book-Entry Note and deliver it to the Company
with an appropriate debit advice. On the
first Business Day of each month, the Trustee
will deliver to the Company a written
statement indicating the total principal
amount of Outstanding Book-Entry Notes as of
the immediately preceding Business Day.

Manner of Payment. The total amount of any
principal, premium, if any, and interest due
on Book-Entry Notes on any Interest Payment
Date or at Maturity shall be paid by the
Company to the Trustee in funds available for
use by the Trustee as of 9:30 a.m., New York
City time, on such date. The Company will
make such payment on such Book-Entry Notes by
instructing the Trustee to withdraw funds from
an account maintained by the Company at the
Trustee. The Company will confirm such
instructions in writing to the Trustee. Prior
to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such
date or as soon as possible thereafter, the
Trustee will pay by separate wire transfer
(using Fedwire message entry instructions in a
form previously specified by DTC) to an
account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York previously specified by DTC, in funds
available for immediate use by DTC, each
payment of interest, principal and premium, if
any, due on a Book-Entry Note on such date. 
Thereafter on such date, DTC will pay, in
accordance with its SDFS operating procedures
then in effect, such amounts in funds
available for immediate use to the respective
Participants in whose names such Notes are
recorded in the book-entry system maintained
by DTC. Neither the Company nor the Trustee
shall have any responsibility or liability for
the payment by DTC of the principal of, or
interest on, the Book-Entry Notes to such
Participants.

Withholding Taxes. The amount of any taxes
required under applicable law to be withheld
from any interest payment on a Note will be
determined and withheld by the Participant,
indirect participant in DTC or other Person
responsible for forwarding payments and
materials directly to the beneficial owner of
such Note.

Settlement Procedures
Timetable: For orders of Notes accepted by the
Company, Settlement Procedures "A"
through "L" set forth above shall be
completed as soon as possible but not
later than the respective times (New York
City time) set forth below:

Settlement
Procedure Time

A-B 11:00 a.m. on the trade date
C 2:00 p.m. on the trade date
D 3:00 p.m. on the Business
Day before Settlement Date
E 9:00 a.m. on Settlement
Date
F 10:00 a.m. on Settlement
Date
G-H No later than 2:00 p.m. on
Settlement Date
I 4:45 p.m. on Settlement
Date
J-L 5:00 p.m. on Settlement 
Date

If a sale is to be settled more than one
Business Day after the sale date, Settlement
Procedures A, B and C may, if necessary, be
completed at any time prior to the specified
times on the first Business Day after such
sale date. In connection with a sale which is
to be settled more than one Business Day after
the trade date, if the initial interest rate
for a Floating Rate Note is not known at the
time that Settlement Procedure A is completed,
Settlement Procedures B and C shall be
completed as soon as such rates have been
determined, but no later than 11:00 a.m. and
2:00 p.m., New York City time, respectively,
on the second Business Day before the
Settlement Date. Settlement Procedure I is
subject to extension in accordance with any
extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in
the other events specified in the SDFS
operating procedures in effect on the
Settlement Date.

If settlement of a Note issued in book-entry
form is rescheduled or cancelled, the Trustee
will deliver to DTC, through DTC's Participant
Terminal system, a cancellation message to
such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the scheduled Settlement
Date.

Failure to Settle: If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver
order with respect to a Book-Entry Note issued
in book-entry form pursuant to Settlement
Procedure G, the Trustee may deliver to DTC,
through DTC's Participant Terminal System, as
soon as practicable a withdrawal message
instructing DTC to debit such Note to the
participant account of the Trustee maintained
at DTC. DTC will process the withdrawal
message, provided that such participant
account contains a principal amount of the
Book-Entry Note representing such Note that is
at least equal to the principal amount to be
debited. If withdrawal messages are processed
with respect to all the Notes represented by a
Book-Entry Note, the Trustee will mark such
Book-Entry Note "cancelled", make appropriate
entries in its records and send such cancelled
Book-Entry Note to the Company. The CUSIP
number assigned to such Book-Entry Note shall,
in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau
procedures, be cancelled and not immediately
reassigned. If withdrawal messages are
processed with respect to a portion of the
Notes represented by a Book-Entry Note, the
Trustee will exchange such Book-Entry Note for
two Book-Entry Notes, one of which shall
represent the Book-Entry Notes for which
withdrawal messages are processed and shall be
cancelled immediately after issuance, and the
other of which shall represent the other Notes
previously represented by the surrendered
Book-Entry Note and shall bear the CUSIP
number of the surrendered Book-Entry Note.

If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Note
is not timely paid to the Participants with
respect to such Note by the beneficial
purchaser thereof (or a person, including an
indirect participant in DTC, acting on behalf
of such purchaser), such Participants and, in
turn, the related Agent may enter SDFS deliver
orders through DTC's Participant Terminal
System reversing the orders entered pursuant
to Settlement Procedures G and H,
respectively. Thereafter, the Trustee will
deliver the withdrawal message and take the
related actions described in the preceding
paragraph. If such failure shall have
occurred for any reason other than default by
the applicable Agent to perform its
obligations hereunder or under the
Distribution Agreement, the Company will
reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for
its loss of the use of funds during the period
when the funds were credited to the account of
the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any
failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry
Note, DTC may take any actions in accordance
with its SDFS operating procedures then in
effect. In the event of a failure to settle
with respect to a Note that was to have been
represented by a Book-Entry Security also
representing other Notes, the Trustee will
provide, accordance with Settlement Procedures
D and E, for the authentication and issuance
of a Book-Entry Note representing such
remaining Notes and will make appropriate
entries in its records.

PART III: PROCEDURES FOR NOTES ISSUED IN
CERTIFICATED FORM

Denominations: The Notes will be issued in denominations of
U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples of U.S.
$1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest: Each Note will bear interest in accordance
with its terms. Interest will begin to accrue
on the Original Issue Date of a Note for the
first interest period and on the most recent
interest payment date to which interest has
been paid for all subsequent interest periods. 
Each payment of interest shall include
interest accrued to, but excluding, the date
of such payment. Unless otherwise specified
in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest
payments in respect of Fixed Rate Notes will
be made semi-annually on April 15 and
October 15 of each year and at Maturity. 
However, the first payment of interest on any
Note issued between a Record Date and an
Interest Payment Date will be made on the
Interest Payment Date following the next
succeeding Record Date. Unless otherwise
specified in the applicable Pricing
Supplement, the Record Date for any payment of
interest shall be the close of business 15
calendar days prior to the applicable Interest
Payment Date. Interest at Maturity will be
payable to the person to whom the principal is
payable.

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of
Floating Rate Notes which reset weekly,
interest payments shall include accrued
interest from, and including, the date of
issue or from, but excluding, the last date in
respect of which interest has been accrued and
paid, as the case may be, through, and
including, the record date which is 15
calendar days immediately preceding such
Interest Payment Date (the "Record Date"),
except that at Maturity the interest payable
will include interest accrued to, but
excluding, the Maturity date. For additional
special provisions relating to Floating Rate
Notes, see the Prospectus Supplement.

Payments of 
Principal and 
Interest: Upon presentment and delivery of the Note, the
Trustee will pay the principal amount of each
Note at Maturity and the final installment of
interest in immediately available funds. All
interest payments on a Note, other than
interest due at Maturity, will be made by
check drawn on the Trustee and mailed by the
Trustee to the person entitled thereto as
provided in the Note. However, holders of ten
million dollars or more in aggregate principal
amount of Notes (whether having identical or
different terms and provisions) shall be
entitled to receive payments of interest,
other than at Maturity, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to a designated
account maintained in the United States upon
receipt by the Trustee of written instructions
from such a holder not later than the regular
Record Date for the related Interest Payment
Date. Any payment of principal or interest
required to be made on an Interest Payment
Date or at Maturity of a Note which is not a
Business Day need not be made on such day, but
may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day with the same force and effect as if made
on the Interest Payment Date or at Maturity,
as the case may be, and no interest shall
accrue for the period from and after such
Interest Payment Date or Maturity.

The Trustee will provide monthly to the
Company a list of the principal and interest
to be paid on Notes maturing in the next
succeeding month. The Trustee will be
responsible for withholding taxes on interest
paid as required by applicable law, but shall
be relieved from any such responsibility if it
acts in good faith and in reliance upon an
opinion of counsel.

Notes presented to the Trustee at Maturity for
payment will be cancelled by the Trustee. All
cancelled Notes held by the Trustee shall be
destroyed, and the Trustee shall furnish to
the Company a certificate with respect to such
destruction.
Settlement
Procedures: Settlement Procedures with regard to each
Note purchased through any Agent, as agent,
shall be as follows:

A. The Presenting Agent will advise the
Company by telephone of the following
Settlement information with regard to
each Note:

1. Exact name in which the Note is to be

Supplement.

deduction of its applicable commission to the Company pursuant to
standard wire instructions given by the Company.

Agent will forthwith notify the Trustee and
the Company by telephone, confirmed in
writing, and return the Note to the Trustee.

The Trustee, upon receipt of the Note from the
Agent, will immediately advise the Company and
the Company will promptly arrange to credit
the account of the Presenting Agent in an
amount of immediately available funds equal to
the amount previously paid by such Agent in
settlement for the Note. Such credits will be
made on the settlement date if possible, and
in any event not later than the Business Day
following the settlement date; provided that
the Company has received notice on the same
day. If such failure shall have occurred for
any reason other than failure by such Agent to
perform its obligations hereunder or under the
Distribution Agreement, the Company will
reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for
its loss of the use of funds during the period
when the funds were credited to the account of
the Company. Immediately upon receipt of the

INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION, a California
corporation (hereinafter called the "Company," which term
includes any successor corporation under the Indenture, as
hereinafter defined), for value received, hereby promises to pay
to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum set forth
above at Stated Maturity shown above and to pay interest thereon
from the Original Issue Date shown above or from the most recent
Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for, in arrears on the Interest
Payment Dates set forth above ("Interest Payment Dates"), until
the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and
on Stated Maturity, commencing with the Interest Payment Date
next succeeding the Original Issue Date, at the rate per annum
determined in accordance with the provisions on the reverse
hereof, depending on the Interest Rate Basis specified above. 
Interest will be payable on each Interest Payment Date and at
Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment. 
Interest will be payable to the Holder at the close of business
on the Regular Record Date as set forth above next preceding such
Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable
at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment will
be payable to the person to whom principal is payable and (to the
extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally
enforceable) at the Overdue Rate, if any, per annum set forth
above on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue
installment of interest. If the Original Issue Date is between a
Regular Record Date and the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date, the first payment of interest hereon will be made on the
Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular
Record Date to the Holder on such next Regular Record Date.

Payment of the principal, and premium, if any, and
interest payable at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or
optional repayment of this Security will be made in immediately
available funds at the corporate trust office of the Trustee in
Chicago, Illinois or at the agency of the Trustee maintained for
that purpose in New York, New York, provided that this Security
is presented to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such
payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. 
Interest (other than interest payable at Stated Maturity or upon
redemption or optional repayment) will be paid by check mailed to
the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears in the
Security Register on the applicable Regular Record Date or, at
the option of the Company, by wire transfer to an account
maintained by such person with a bank located in the United
States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Depositary or its
nominee, if it is the registered Holder of this Security, will be
entitled to receive payments of interest (other than at Stated
Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment) by wire
transfer to an account maintained by such Holder with a bank
located in the United States, and (ii) a Holder of $10,000,000 or
more in aggregate principal amount of Securities having the same
Interest Payment Date will, upon receipt on or prior to the
Regular Record Date preceding an applicable Interest Payment Date
by the Trustee of written instructions from such Holder, be
entitled to receive payments of interest (other than at Stated
Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment) by wire
transfer to an account maintained by such Holder with a bank
located in the United States. Such instructions shall remain in
effect with respect to payments of interest made to such Holder
on subsequent Interest Payment Dates unless revoked or changed by
written instructions received by the Trustee from such Holder,
provided that any such written revocation or change which is
received by the Trustee after a Regular Record Date and before
the related Interest Payment Date shall not be effective with
respect to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.

REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF
THIS SECURITY SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER
PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET
FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has

Indenture 

CONTINENTAL BANK,

As Trustee Attest:

By
Authorized Signatory 

INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION
MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, SERIES G
(FLOATING RATE)

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of
Medium-Term Notes, Series G of the Company (herein called the
"Securities"), issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated
as of November 1, 1991 (herein called the "Indenture") between
the Company and Continental Bank, National Association, as
trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and
all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for
a statement of the respective rights, limitation of rights,
duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and
the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This
Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof. The
Securities of this series may be issued from time to time at
varying maturities, interest rates and other terms as may be
designated with respect to a Security.

Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date specified
on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on
the face hereof, the rate at which interest on this Security is
payable shall be reset weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually
or annually as shown on the face hereof under the Interest Rate
Reset Period based upon the interest rate in effect on the
applicable interest determination date specified on the face
hereof (the "Interest Determination Date"); provided, however,
that (i) the interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date
to the first Interest Reset Date with respect to this Security
will be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof
and (ii) the interest rate in effect for the ten days immediately
prior to Stated Maturity (or redemption or optional repayment)
will be that in effect on the tenth day preceding such Stated
Maturity date (or such date of redemption or optional repayment).

Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable on or after the
Interest Reset Date to which it relates, to, but not including,
the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until the Stated
Maturity. If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day
that is not a Business Day (as defined below), such Interest
Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is
a Business Day, except that if the Interest Rate Basis specified
on the face hereof is LIBOR, and if such Business Day is in the
next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be
the immediately preceding Business Day. Subject to provisions of
applicable law and except as specified herein, on each Interest
Reset Date the rate of interest on this Security shall be the
rate determined in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable heading below.

Determination of Commercial Paper Rate

If the Interest Rate Basis on this Security is the
Commercial Paper Rate, the interest rate with respect to this
Security shall be the Commercial Paper Rate determined by the
Calculation Agent appointed as agent by and of the Company to
calculate the rates of interest applicable to securities
including this Security ("Calculation Agent") in accordance with
the following provisions, adjusted by the Spread, if any,
specified on the face hereof or by the Spread Multiplier, if any,
specified on the face hereof:

"Commercial Paper Rate" means, with respect to an
Interest Determination Date, the Money Market Yield (as defined
below) of the rate on that date for commercial paper having the
Index Maturity stated above as published by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical Release
H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates," or any successor publication
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
("H.15(519)") under the heading "Commercial Paper." In the event
that such rate is not published by 9:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination
Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market
Yield of the rate on that Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper having the Index Maturity stated above as
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in its daily
statistical release "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S.
Government Securities" or any successor publication published by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("Composite Quotations")
under the heading "Commercial Paper." If by 3:00 p.m., New York
City time, on such Calculation Date such rate is not yet
published in H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the Commercial
Paper Rate for that Interest Determination Date shall be
calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Money Market
Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates of three
leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of New York
(selected by the Calculation Agent) as of 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, on that Interest Determination Date, for commercial
paper having the Index Maturity stated above placed for an
industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent,
from a nationally recognized rating agency; provided, however,
that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation
Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the
Commercial Paper Rate will be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect
on such Interest Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield calculated in
accordance with the following formula:

Money Market Yield = 
[D X 360 divided by 360 - (D X M)] X 100

where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper
quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and
"M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest period
for which interest is being calculated.

The Commercial Paper Rate determined with respect to
any Interest Determination Date will become effective on and as
of the second Business Day following the Interest Determination
Date (the "Commercial Paper Reset Date"); provided, however, that
(i) the interest rate in effect for the period from the date of
issue to the first Commercial Paper Reset Date will be the
Initial Interest Rate specified on the face hereof; and (ii) the
interest rate in effect for the ten days immediately preceding
the Stated Maturity (or redemption or optional repayment) will be
that in effect on the tenth day preceding such Stated Maturity
date (or such date of redemption or optional repayment).

Determination of LIBOR

If the Interest Rate Basis on this Security is LIBOR,
the interest rate with respect to this Security shall be LIBOR
determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the
following provisions, adjusted by the Spread, if any, specified
on the face hereof or by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified
on the face hereof:

(i) With respect to an Interest Determination Date,
LIBOR will be, as shown on the face hereof, either: (a) the
arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars
having the Index Maturity stated above, commencing on the second
London Business Day immediately following that Interest
Determination Date, that appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page
as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination
Date, if at least two such offered rates appear on the Reuters
Screen LIBO Page ("LIBOR Reuters"), or (b) the rate for deposits
in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity stated above,
commencing on the second London Business Day immediately
following that Interest Determination Date, that appears on the
Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that
Interest Determination Date ("LIBOR Telerate"). "Reuters Screen
LIBO Page" means the display designated as page "LIBO" on the
Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may
replace the LIBO page on that service for the purpose of
displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks).
"Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as page "3750"
on the Telerate Service (or such other page as may replace the
3750 page on that service or such other service or services as
may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the
purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S.
dollar deposits). If neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is
specified above, LIBOR will be determined as if LIBOR Telerate
had been specified. If fewer than two offered rates appear on
the Reuters Screen LIBO Page, or if no rate appears on the
Telerate Page 3750, as applicable, LIBOR in respect of that
Interest Determination Date will be determined as if the parties
had specified the rate described in (ii) below.

(ii) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on
which fewer than two offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen
LIBO Page, as specified in (i)(a) above, or on which no rate
appears on Telerate Page 3750, as specified in (i)(b) above, as
applicable, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at
which deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity stated
above are offered at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on
that Interest Determination Date by four major banks in the
London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent
("Reference Banks") to prime banks in the London interbank market
commencing on the second London Business Day immediately
following that Interest Determination Date and in a principal
amount equal to an amount of not less than $1,000,000 that is
representative for a single transaction in such market at such
time. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London
office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of
its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR in
respect of that Interest Determination Date will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations
are provided, LIBOR in respect of that Interest Determination
Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at
approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest
Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York
selected by the Calculation Agent for the loans in U.S. dollars
to leading European banks having the Index Maturity stated above
commencing on the second London Business Day immediately
following that Interest Determination Date and in a principal
amount equal to an amount of not less than $1,000,000 that is
representative for a single transaction in such market at such
time; provided, however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid
by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this
sentence, LIBOR with respect to such Interest Determination Date
will be the rate of LIBOR in effect on such date.

LIBOR determined with respect to any Interest
Determination Date will become effective on and as of the second
London Business Day following such Interest Determination Date
(the "LIBOR Reset Date"); provided, however, that (i) the
interest rate in effect for the period from the Original Issue
Date to the first LIBOR Reset Date will be the Initial Interest
Rate specified on the face hereof; and (ii) the interest rate in
effect for the ten days immediately preceding the Stated Maturity
(or redemption or optional repayment) will be that in effect on
the tenth day preceding such Stated Maturity date (or such date
of redemption or optional repayment). 

"London Business Day" means any day on which dealings
in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.

Determination of Treasury Rate

If the Interest Rate Basis on this Security is the
Treasury Rate, the interest rate with respect to this Security
shall be the Treasury Rate determined by the Calculation Agent in
accordance with the following provisions, adjusted by the Spread,
if any, specified on the face hereof or by the Spread Multiplier,
if any, specified on the face hereof:

"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to an Interest
Determination Date, the rate for the auction held on such
Interest Determination Date of direct obligations of the United
States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity stated above
as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Treasury bills--
auction average (investment)" or, if not so published by 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to
such Interest Determination Date, the auction average rate
(expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) as
otherwise announced by the United States Department of the
Treasury. In the event that the results of the auction of
Treasury bills having the Index Maturity stated above are not
published or reported as provided above by 3:00 p.m., New York
City time, on such Calculation Date or if no such auction is held
on such Interest Determination Date, then the Treasury Rate shall
be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield to
maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year
of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis)
of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of
approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such Interest
Determination Date, of three leading primary United States
government securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent
for the issue of Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closes
to the Index Maturity stated above; provided, however, that if
the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are
not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate will
be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Interest Determination
Date.

The Treasury Rate determined with respect to any
Interest Determination Date will become effective on and as of
the next succeeding Interest Reset Date specified on the face
hereof (the "Treasury Reset Date"); provided, however, that (i)
the interest rate in effect for the period from the date of issue
to the first Treasury Reset Date will be the Initial Interest
Rate specified on the face hereof; and (ii) the interest rate in
effect for the ten days immediately preceding the Stated Maturity
(or redemption or optional repayment) will be that in effect on
the tenth day preceding such Stated Maturity date (or such date
of redemption or optional repayment).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon
shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or
less than the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, shown on the face
hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate
on this Security in accordance with the foregoing on each
Interest Determination Date.

The interest rate on this Security will in no event be
higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York or California
law as the same may be modified by the United States law of
general applicability. 

The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of the
Holder of this Security, provide to such Holder the interest rate
hereon then in effect and, if different, the interest rate which
will become effective as of the next applicable Interest Reset
Date.

If any Interest Payment Date specified on the face
hereof would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the
Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is
a Business Day, except that if (i) the rate of interest on this
Security shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of
the heading "Determination of LIBOR" above, and (ii) such
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such
Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business
Day. "Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday or
Sunday and that, in The City of New York (and, if the rate of
interest on this Security shall be determined in accordance with
the provisions of the heading "Determination of LIBOR" above, the
City of London), is not a day on which banking institutions are
generally authorized or obligated by law to close.

Interest payments for this Security will include
interest accrued from and including the date of issue or from and
including the last date in respect of which interest has been
paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, the Interest Payment
Date; provided, however, that if the Interest Reset Dates with
respect to this Security are weekly, interest payments shall
include accrued interest from and including the date of issue or
from but excluding the last date in respect of which interest has
been paid, as the case may be, to and including, the date which
is 15 calendar days immediately preceding such Interest Payment
Date, except that at Stated Maturity (or upon redemption or
optional repayment) the interest payable will include interest
accrued to, but excluding, the Stated Maturity date (or such date
of redemption or optional repayment). Accrued interest hereon
from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which
interest hereon has been paid, as the case may be, shall be an
amount calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an
accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be
computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day
from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which
interest shall have been paid, as the case may be, to the date
for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest
factor for each such day shall be computed by dividing the
interest rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such day by
360, in case the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the
Commercial Paper Rate or LIBOR, or by the actual number of days
in the year in the case the Interest Rate Basis of this Security
is the Treasury Rate.

Unless otherwise indicated on the face of this
Security, this Security may not be redeemed prior to Stated
Maturity. If so indicated on the face of this Security, this
Security may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, on any
date on or after the date set forth on the face hereof, either in
whole or from time to time in part at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount redeemed, together with interest
accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of redemption. Notice of
redemption shall be mailed to the Holders of the Securities
designated for redemption at their addresses as the same shall
appear in the Security Register not less than 30 and not more
than 60 days prior to the date of redemption, subject to all the
conditions and provisions of the Indenture. In the event of any
redemption, the Company will not be required to (i) issue,
register the transfer of, or exchange any Security during a
period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any
selection of Securities to be redeemed and ending at the close of
business on the date of mailing of the relevant notice of
redemption or (ii) register the transfer or exchange of any
Security, or any portion thereof, called for redemption, except
the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. 
Only a new Security or Securities for the amount of the
unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the
Holder upon the cancellation hereof.

If so provided on the face of this Security, the
Security will be subject to repayment at the option of the Holder
on the date or dates so indicated on the face hereof. If no date
or dates for such repayment are set forth on the face hereof,
this Security will not be repayable at the option of the Holder
prior to Stated Maturity. On an optional repayment date, if any,
this Security will be repayable in whole or in part in increments
of $1,000 at the option of the Holder at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount to be repaid, together with interest thereon
payable to the date of repayment, if the "Option to Elect
Repayment," duly completed and received by the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Security, is received by the
Company not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the date
or dates of repayment set forth on the face hereof. In the event
of repayment of this Security in part only, a new Security for
the unrepaid portion thereof shall be issued in the name of the
Holder hereof upon the surrender hereof.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the
Securities of the series may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as
therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of
the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the
Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each series
to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Securities of any series to waive
compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and
upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon this Security.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision
of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this
Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or
currency, herein prescribed. However, the Indenture limits
Holder's rights to enforce the Indenture and this Security.

This Security is exchangeable only if (i) the
Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for this Global Security or if at any time
the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor
Depositary is not appointed within the time specified in the
Indenture, or (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines
that all Global Securities of the same series as this Security
shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of differing
denominations aggregating a like amount in registered form. If
this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence,
it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of differing
denominations aggregating a like amount in registered form in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof, bearing interest at the same rate or pursuant to
the same formula, having the same date of issuance, redemption
provisions, if any, Stated Maturity and other terms.

The Depositary will not sell, assign, transfer or
otherwise convey any beneficial interest in this Security unless
such beneficial interest is in an amount equal to $1,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Depositary,
by accepting this Security, agrees to be bound by such provision.

No service charge shall be made for any such
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for
registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent
of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name
this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes,
whether or not this Security be overdue and none of the Company,
the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

All percentages resulting from any calculation on this
Security will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of
a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage
point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be
rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used
in or resulting from such calculation on this Security will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded
upwards).

THE INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in
the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.

INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION, a California
corporation (herein called the "Company", which term includes any
successor corporation under the Indenture, as hereinafter
defined), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede &
Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum set forth above at
Stated Maturity shown above and to pay interest thereon from the
Original Issue Date shown above or from the most recent Interest
Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest has been paid
or duly provided for at a fixed rate per annum semi-annually in
arrears on April 15 and October 15 in each year, unless otherwise
set forth above ("Interest Payment Dates"), until the principal
hereof is paid or made available for payment, and on Stated
Maturity. Interest will be payable on each Interest Payment Date
and at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment. 
Interest will be payable to the Holder at the close of business
on the Regular Record Date which shall be April 1 and October 1
of each year, unless otherwise set forth above, next preceding
such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest
payable at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional
repayment will be payable to the person to whom principal is
payable and (to the extent that the payment of such interest
shall be legally enforceable) at the Overdue Rate, if any, per
annum set forth above on any overdue principal and premium and on
any overdue installment of interest. If the Original Issue Date
is between a Regular Record Date and the next succeeding Interest
Payment Date, the first payment of interest hereon will be made
on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding
Regular Record Date to the Holder on such next Regular Record
Date.

Payment of the principal, and premium, if any, and
interest payable at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or
optional repayment on this Security will be made in immediately
available funds at the corporate trust office of the Trustee in
Chicago, Illinois or at the agency of the Trustee maintained for
that purpose in New York, New York, provided that this Security
is presented to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such
payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. 
Interest (other than interest payable at Stated Maturity or upon
redemption or optional repayment) will be paid by check mailed to
the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears in the
Security Register on the applicable Regular Record Date or, at
the option of the Company, by wire transfer to an account
maintained by such person with a bank located in the United
States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Depositary or its
nominee, if it is the registered Holder of this Security, will be
entitled to receive payments of interest (other than at Stated
Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment) by wire
transfer to an account maintained by such Holder with a bank
located in the United States, and (ii) a Holder of $10,000,000 or
more in aggregate principal amount of Securities having the same
Interest Payment Date will, upon receipt on or prior to the
Regular Record Date preceding an applicable Interest Payment Date
by the Trustee of written instructions from such Holder, be
entitled to receive payments of interest (other than at Stated
Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment) by wire
transfer to an account maintained by such Holder with a bank
located in the United States. Such instructions shall remain in
effect with respect to payments of interest made to such Holder
on subsequent Interest Payment Dates unless revoked or changed by
written instructions received by the Trustee from such Holder,
provided that any such written revocation or change which is
received by the Trustee after a Regular Record Date and before
the related Interest Payment Date shall not be effective with
respect to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.

REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF
THIS SECURITY SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER
PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET
FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of
Medium-Term Notes, Series G of the Company (herein called the
"Securities"), issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated
as of November 1, 1991 (herein called the "Indenture") between
the Company and Continental Bank, National Association, as
trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and
all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for
a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights,
duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and
the Holders of the Securities and the terms upon which the
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This
Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof. The
Securities of this series may be issued from time to time at
varying maturities, interest rates and other terms as may be
designated with respect to a Security.

Interest payments for this Security will include
interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Dates. 
Interest payments for this Security shall be computed and paid on
the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If any
Interest Payment Date specified on the face hereof would
otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest
Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a
Business Day. "Business Day" means any day that is not a
Saturday or Sunday and that, in The City of New York, is not a
day on which banking institutions are generally authorized or
obligated to close.

Unless otherwise indicated on the face of this
Security, this Security may not be redeemed prior to Stated
Maturity. If so indicated on the face of this Security, this
Security may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, on any
date on or after the date set forth on the face hereof, either in
whole or from time to time in part at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount redeemed, together with interest
accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of redemption. Notice of
redemption shall be mailed to the Holders of the Securities
designated for redemption at their addresses as the same shall
appear in the Security Register not less than 30 and not more
than 60 days prior to the date of redemption, subject to all the
conditions and provisions of the Indenture. In the event of any
redemption, the Company will not be required to (i) issue,
register the transfer of, or exchange any Security during a
period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any
selection of Securities to be redeemed and ending at the close of
business on the date of mailing of the relevant notice of
redemption or (ii) register the transfer or exchange of any
Security, or any portion thereof, called for redemption, except
the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. 
Only a new Security or Securities for the amount of the
unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the
Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

If so provided on the face of this Security, the
Security will be subject to repayment at the option of the Holder
on the date or dates so indicated on the face hereof. If no date
or dates for such repayment are set forth on the face hereof,
this Security will not be repayable at the option of the Holder
prior to Stated Maturity. On an optional repayment date, if any,
this Security will be repayable in whole or in part in increments
of $1,000 at the option of the Holder at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount to be repaid, together with interest thereon
payable to the date of repayment, if the "Option to Elect
Repayment," duly completed and received by the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Security, is received by the
Company not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the date
or dates of repayment set forth on the face hereof. In the event
of repayment of this Security in part only, a new Security for
the unrepaid portion thereof shall be issued in the name of the
Holder hereof upon the surrender hereof.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the
Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as
therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of
the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the
Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each series
to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Securities of any such series to waive
compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and
upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon this Security.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provisions
of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this
Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or
currency, herein prescribed. However, the Indenture limits
Holder's rights to enforce the Indenture and this Security.

This Security is exchangeable only if (i) the
Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for this Global Security or if at any time
the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor
Depositary is not appointed within the time specified in the
Indenture, or (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines
that all Global Securities of the same series as this Security
shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of differing
denominations aggregating a like amount in registered form. If
this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence,
it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of differing
denominations aggregating a like amount in registered form in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof, bearing interest at the same rate, having the
same date of issuance, redemption provisions, if any, Stated
Maturity and other terms.

The Depositary will not sell, assign, transfer or
otherwise convey any beneficial interest in this Security unless
such beneficial interest is in an amount equal to $1,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Depositary,
by accepting this Security, agrees to be bound by such provision.

No service charge shall be made for any such
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for
registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent
of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name
this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes,
whether or not this Security be overdue, and none of the Company,
the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

THE INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
AND CONSTITUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in
the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.

Re: Up to $500,000,000 Aggregate Principal 
Amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series G of
International Lease Finance Corporation 
(the "Notes") 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as your counsel in connection with the
issuance and sale from time to time of the Notes. The Notes
constitute a series of the Debt Securities registered on a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 33-59362), as
amended (the "Registration Statement"), filed by International
Lease Finance Corporation (the "Company") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes are being issued under an
Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1991 (the "Indenture"),
between the Company and Continental Bank, National Association,
as Trustee.

On the basis of our consideration of such questions of
law as we have deemed relevant in the circumstances, we are of
the opinion, subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth
herein, that the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and when the final
terms of a particular Note and of its issuance and sale have been
duly established in conformity with the Indenture, and when such
Note has been duly executed, authenticated and issued in
accordance with the Indenture and upon payment for and delivery
of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Distribution
Agreement dated as of May 17, 1994 among the Company, Merrill
Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
Salomon Brothers Inc, will be legally valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their terms, except as limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and except that the enforceability
of the Notes is subject to the effect of general principles of
equity including, without limitation, concepts of materiality,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible
unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law.

We have, with your approval, assumed that the
certificates for the Notes will conform to the forms thereof
examined by us, that the signatures on all documents examined by
us are genuine, that all items submitted as originals are
authentic, and that all items submitted as copies conform to the
originals, assumptions which we have not independently verified.

We consent to the incorporation by reference of this
opinion in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, event date
May 17, 1994.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ O'Melveny & Myers
