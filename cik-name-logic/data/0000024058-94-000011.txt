Item 5. Other Events.

As reported on its current report on Form 8-K dated January 27, 1994
(earliest event reported), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on February 7, 1994, Continental Bank Corporation ("Continental" or
"registrant"), a Delaware corporation, and BankAmerica Corporation
("BankAmerica"), a Delaware corporation, have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated as of January 27, 1994 (the "Agreement") pursuant to which
Continental will be merged with and into BankAmerica in a transaction in which
BankAmerica will be the surviving entity (such transaction, the "Merger").

BankAmerica and Continental have entered into a letter agreement dated
March 11, 1994 pursuant to which BankAmerica and Continental have agreed to
certain revisions and amendments to the Agreement. The revisions and amendments
to the Agreement are reflected in a Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger
between BankAmerica and Continental dated as of January 27, 1994 (the "Restated
Agreement"). One such amendment is the change, from twenty-five days to
thirty-five days, of the Mailing Date (as defined in the Restated Agreement)
prior to the anticipated effective date of the Merger of election forms pursuant
to which holders of common stock of Continental may elect to receive cash or
stock consideration in the Merger, with the result that the time during which
Continental stockholders must return such elections will expire five days prior
to the end of the Valuation Period (as defined in the Agreement) for the
determination of the Final BAC Stock Price (as defined in the Restated
Agreement). In addition, holders of Continental common stock who duly elect to
receive stock or cash consideration in the Merger may also elect to have their
share holdings divided into blocks of not less than 5,000 shares of Continental
common stock, with remaining shares being added to one of the designated blocks
of 5,000 shares, for purposes of the allocation of stock and cash consideration
in the Merger.

Under the Restated Agreement, as under the Agreement, Continental was
obligated to provide to BankAmerica certain disclosure schedules in form and
detail of presentation reasonably satisfactory to BankAmerica. The Restated
Agreement provides further that, for 10 business days after the date of receipt
by BankAmerica of such disclosure schedules, BankAmerica had the right, in its
sole discretion, to terminate the Restated Agreement. The 10 business day
period during which BankAmerica could exercise such right of termination with
respect to the Restated Agreement has expired, and BankAmerica did not exercise
such termination right.

Under the Restated Agreement, as under the Agreement, BankAmerica also
has the right to terminate the Restated Agreement during the 30 calendar day
period beginning after the date of receipt by BankAmerica of the disclosure
schedules if BankAmerica identifies any circumstances which, in the reasonable
judgment of BankAmerica's Board of Directors (including a committee thereof),
acting in good faith and with due regard for principles of fair dealing, could
(i) materially and adversely impact the reasonably expected financial or
business benefits to BankAmerica of the Merger, (ii) be inconsistent in any
material and adverse respect with any of the representations and warranties of
Continental contained in the Restated Agreement, (iii) materially and adversely
affect the business, operations, properties, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects of Continental and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis or (iv) deviate materially and adversely from Continental's financial
statements for the year or quarter ended

December 31, 1993. In addition, under certain other circumstances, BankAmerica
or Continental may terminate the Restated Agreement, as specified therein.

The Restated Agreement is attached as an exhibit to this report and is
incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing discussion of the Restated
Agreement does not purport to be a complete summary of the Restated Agreement
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.

This RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into
as of January 27, 1994 between BANKAMERICA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("BAC"), and CONTINENTAL BANK CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("Continental"). This Agreement amends and restates that certain Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of January 27, 1994, between BAC and Continental.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in Article II.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, BAC and Continental are registered bank holding companies under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"); and

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of BAC and Continental have concluded that
there would be substantial long-term benefits to both organizations and their
respective stockholders arising from a business combination resulting in a
strategic alliance between the equity owners of BAC and Continental, including
without limitation, the opening of important new geographic markets for both
BAC and Continental; and

WHEREAS, BAC believes that it would be advantageous to the future operations
of BAC and Continental that the headquarters of the United States corporate
banking division of BAC be located in the City of Chicago, State of Illinois,
following the business combination so that substantially all of the
administrative operations of such division as now conducted would be
headquartered in Chicago in combination with the similar operations of
Continental, and BAC intends to so relocate such operations of BAC after the
business combination; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to BAC's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, Continental and BAC are entering into immediately after the
execution and delivery hereof a Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date
hereof (the "Stock Option Agreement") pursuant to which Continental shall grant
to BAC an option to purchase shares of the Common Stock, par value $4 per
share, of Continental (the "Continental Common Stock"); and

WHEREAS, BAC and Continental desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the transactions hereby
contemplated and to prescribe various conditions thereto; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, BAC shall have the option to effect a business combination with
Continental by way of a merger of Continental with and into BAC, or by such
other means as are provided for herein (the "Merger"); and

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of BAC and Continental have
resolved that the transactions described herein are in the best interests of
the parties and their respective stockholders and have approved the
transactions described herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE III

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

3.1 Conversion.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article III and of Article I, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holders thereof, the shares of the Constituent Corporations shall be
converted as follows:

(i) Each of the shares of capital stock of BAC issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
as one share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(ii) Each share of Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1, $50
stated value, of Continental ("Continental Series 1 Preferred Stock"),
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1, $50 stated value, of
BAC ("BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock"). Each share of the Adjustable Rate
Preferred Stock, Series 2, $100 stated value, of Continental ("Continental
Series 2 Preferred Stock" and, together with Continental Series 1 Preferred
Stock, the "Continental Preferred Stock") outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except shares held by persons who demand appraisal in
compliance with all provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of such
holders to dissent from the Merger and demand appraisal of their shares
("Dissenting Series 2 Holders") but only if holders of such shares are then
entitled to so dissent and demand appraisal pursuant to the DGCL) shall be
converted into one share of Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock,

-7-

<PAGE>
Series 2, $100 stated value, of BAC ("BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock" and,
together with BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock, the "BAC Mirror Preferred
Stock"). The BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock and BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock
shall have the terms substantially as set forth in the forms of Certificate
of Designation, Preferences and Rights attached hereto as Exhibits
3.1(a)(ii)-1 and 3.1(a)(ii)-2, respectively. All such shares of Continental
Preferred Stock, other than shares held by Dissenting Series 2 Holders (if
such holders are then entitled to dissent and demand appraisal as set forth
above), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares of Continental Preferred Stock shall thereafter
represent the shares of BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock or BAC Series 2
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, into which such Continental Preferred
Stock has been converted. Certificates previously representing shares of
Continental Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing
whole shares of BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock or BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock
to be issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificates in accordance with Section 4.1. If holders of shares of
Continental Series 2 Preferred Stock are entitled to dissent from the Merger
and demand appraisal of their shares under the DGCL, any issued and
outstanding shares of Continental Series 2 Preferred Stock held by a
Dissenting Series 2 Holder shall not be converted as described in this
Section 3.1(a)(ii) but shall from and after the Effective Time represent only
the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to
such Dissenting Series 2 Holder pursuant to section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, however, that each share of Continental Series 2 Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting
Series 2 Holder who shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw his or her
demand for appraisal or lose his or her right of appraisal, in either case
pursuant to the DGCL, shall be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective
Time, into one share of BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock;

(iii) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.5, each share of
Continental Common Stock (including the related rights issued under the
Continental Rights Agreement) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time which under the terms of Section 3.2 is to be converted into
cash shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration (as defined in Section 3.2);

(iv) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.5, each share of
Continental Common Stock (including the related rights issued under the
Continental Rights Agreement) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time which under the terms of Section 3.2 is to be converted into
BAC Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration (as defined in Section 3.2);

(v) Each Continental Option outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.9; and

(vi) Each outstanding share of Continental Stock as to which a
written demand for appraisal is filed in accordance with section 262 of the
DGCL at or prior to the Stockholders' Meeting and not withdrawn at or prior
to the Stockholders' Meeting and which is not voted in favor of the Merger
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive BAC Common Stock
or cash hereunder unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal of
and payment for his or her Continental Common Stock under such section 262,
at which time his or her shares shall either be converted into BAC Common
Stock or cash as set forth in Section 3.1(a)(iii) or (iv) in accordance with
Section 3.7. All such shares of Continental Common Stock as to which such a
written demand for appraisal is so filed and not withdrawn at or prior to the
time of such vote and which

-8-

<PAGE>
are not voted in favor of the Merger, except any such shares of Continental
Common Stock the holder of which, prior to the Effective Time, shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal of payment for
his or her shares of Continental Common Stock under such section 262 are
herein called "Dissenting Continental Stock." Continental shall give BAC
prompt notice upon receipt by Continental of any written demands for
appraisal rights, withdrawal of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to section 262 of the DGCL and Continental shall give BAC the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Continental shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal rights and shall not, except with the prior written
consent of BAC, settle or offer to settle any such demands. Each holder of
Continental Common Stock who becomes entitled, pursuant to provisions of said
section 262, to payment for his or her shares of Continental Common Stock
under the provisions of said section shall receive payment therefor from the
Surviving Corporation and such shares of Continental Common Stock shall be
canceled.

(b) The calculations of the computations required by this Article III
shall be prepared by BAC prior to the Closing Date and shall be set forth in a
statement furnished to Continental showing in reasonable detail the manner of
calculation.

(c) Each of the shares of Continental capital stock held by BAC or any of
its wholly owned Subsidiaries or Continental or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries, other than shares held by BAC or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries or Continental or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries in a
fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted, shall be
canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued
in exchange therefor.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Continental Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of BAC
Common Stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of BAC Common Stock multiplied by the
Market Price of one share of BAC Common Stock at the close of business on the
trading day next preceding the Closing Date. No such holder will be entitled
to dividends, voting rights or any other rights as a stockholder in respect of
any fractional share.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Continental shall
be closed as to holders of Continental capital stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no transfer of Continental capital stock by any such holder
shall thereafter be made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates are properly presented in accordance with Article IV of this
Agreement to the exchange agent, Chemical Trust Company of California (the
"Exchange Agent"), such certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for
certificates representing the number of whole shares of BAC or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and a check representing the amount of
cash, if any, into which the Continental capital stock represented thereby was
converted in the Merger. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither BAC, Continental, the Surviving Corporation nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of Continental capital stock for any
amount paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar law.

3.2 Conversion of Continental Common Stock. Subject to Sections 3.4 and
3.5, each share of Continental Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder
thereof as provided in Section 3.3, either:

(i) a number of shares of BAC Common Stock equal to the sum of (A)
.4158 and (B) the ratio of $18.375 to the Final BAC Stock Price (such sum,
the "Per Share Stock Consideration"), or

-9-

<PAGE>
(ii) cash equal to the sum of (A) $18.375 and (B) the product of
.4158 and the Final BAC Stock Price (such sum, the "Per Share Cash
Consideration");

provided that, subject to Section 3.4, the aggregate number of shares of BAC
Common Stock that shall be issued in the Merger (the "Stock Amount") shall
equal the number obtained by multiplying (x) 0.8152 and (y) 51% of the total
number of shares of Continental Common Stock outstanding (other than treasury
shares) at the Determination Date.

3.3 Election Procedures. An election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of Continental Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as BAC and
Continental shall mutually agree ("Election Form") shall be mailed thirty-five
days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date as
Continental and BAC shall mutually agree ("Mailing Date") to each holder of
record of Continental Common Stock as of five business days prior to the
Mailing Date ("Election Form Record Date").

Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through
appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to elect to receive
only BAC Common Stock with respect to such holder's Continental Common Stock
("Stock Election Shares"), to elect to receive only cash with respect to such
holder's Continental Common Stock ("Cash Election Shares") or to indicate that
such holder makes no election ("No Election Shares").

Holders of Continental Common Stock who duly elect to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Merger may also
elect to have their share holdings divided into blocks of not less than 5,000
shares of Continental Common Stock with any remaining shares being added to one
of the designated blocks of 5,000 shares (such blocks being herein called the
"Stock Blocks") for purposes of the allocation procedures described below in
this Section 3.3. Such holders who do not make such election or who hold less
than 5,000 shares of Continental Common Stock will have all of their holdings
treated as a single Stock Block for purposes of such allocation procedures.

Any Continental Common Stock with respect to which the holder (or the
beneficial owner, as the case may be) shall not have submitted to the Exchange
Agent, an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m.,
on the 20th day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as BAC
and Continental may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline") shall also be
deemed to be "No Election Shares."

BAC shall make available one or more Election Forms as may be reasonably
requested by all persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of
Continental Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and close of
business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and Continental
shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it
to perform as specified herein.

Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of
Continental Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form at
or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked
prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Continental Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares and BAC shall
cause the certificates representing Continental Common Stock to be promptly
returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon written
request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,

-10-

<PAGE>
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of BAC
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither BAC nor the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect
in an Election Form.

Within fifteen calendar days after the Election Deadline, unless the
Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as
practicable, BAC shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among
the holders of Continental Common Stock of rights to receive BAC Common Stock
or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

(i) Stock Elections Less Than Stock Amount. If the number of shares
of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon conversion in the Merger of the
Stock Election Shares is less than the Stock Amount, then:

(A) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive BAC Common Stock,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall select, by random selection,
first, from among the holders of No Election Shares a sufficient
number of such holders ("Stock Designees") and then, if necessary, a
sufficient number of Stock Blocks ("Designated Stock Shares") held by
holders of Cash Election Shares, such that the number of shares of
BAC Common Stock that will be issued in the Merger equals as closely
as practicable the Stock Amount, and all shares held by the Stock
Designees and, if any, all Designated Stock Shares, will be converted
into the right to receive BAC Common Stock, provided that no
particular holder of Cash Election Shares shall be deemed to be a
Stock Designee, nor shall any such holder's shares be included within
the Designated Stock Shares if such would prevent the satisfaction of
any of the conditions set forth in Article IX, and

(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Designated Stock
Shares and the No Election Shares that are not held by Stock
Designees shall be converted into the right to receive cash; or

(ii) Stock Elections More Than Stock Amount. If the number of
shares of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon the conversion into BAC
Common Stock of the Stock Election Shares is greater than the Stock Amount,
then:

(A) all Cash Election Shares and No Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive cash,

(B) the Exchange Agent will select, by random selection, a
sufficient number of Stock Blocks ("Designated Cash Shares") held by
holders of Stock Election Shares, so that the number of shares of BAC
Common Stock that will be issued in the Merger equals as closely as
practicable the Stock Amount, and any Designated Cash Shares will be
converted into the right to receive cash, provided that no particular
holder of Stock Election Shares shall be deemed to be a Cash
Designee, nor shall any such holder's shares be included within the
Designated Cash Shares if such circumstance would prevent the
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article IX, and

(C) the Stock Election Shares that are not Designated Cash
Shares will be converted into the right to receive BAC Common Stock;
or

-11-

<PAGE>
(iii) Stock Elections Equal to Stock Amount. If the number of
shares of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon conversion into BAC
Common Stock of the Stock Election Shares is equal or nearly equal (as
determined by the Exchange Agent) to the Stock Amount, then subparagraphs (i)
and (ii) above and subparagraph (iv) below shall not apply and all Stock
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive BAC Common Stock
and all Cash Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive cash; or

(iv) Stock Elections and No Elections Equal to Stock Amount. If the
number of shares of BAC Common Stock that would be issued upon the conversion
into BAC Common Stock of the Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares
would equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) the Stock
Amount, then subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall not apply and all
Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive cash and
all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive BAC Common Stock.

The random selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist
of such processes as shall be mutually determined by BAC and Continental.

3.4 Continental Termination Right; BAC Adjustment Right; Cap on Final BAC
Stock Price for Calculation of Per Share Stock and Cash Consideration.

(a) Continental Termination Right. Continental shall have the right to
elect to abandon the Merger and terminate this Agreement, if its Board of
Directors so determines, following the Determination Date but prior to the
Effective Time if the Final BAC Stock Price shall be less than $36.16 (the
"Floor Price") subject, however, to the following subparagraph (b).

(b) BAC Adjustment Right. If Continental makes an election to abandon
the Merger under subparagraph (a) above, it shall give prompt written notice
thereof to BAC, provided that such notice may be withdrawn by Continental at
any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the
Effective Time. If Continental shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to subparagraph (a) above but shall not have done so, or at
any time within five days of Continental's having done so, BAC shall have the
right but not the obligation to elect to increase the Stock Amount and the per
share value of the cash and BAC Common Stock which would be delivered to the
holders of the Continental Common Stock such that (A) the per share value of
the cash and BAC Common Stock consideration (valued in the case of the BAC
Common Stock at the Final BAC Stock Price) is at least equal to the per share
consideration that would have been received if the Final BAC Stock Price had
been equal to the Floor Price and (B) in the opinion of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen
& Katz the Merger qualifies as a reorganization under section 368 of the Code,
except for cash payments (including cash in lieu of fractional shares), no gain
or loss will be recognized by any holder of Continental Common Stock upon
conversion of such stock into BAC Common Stock in the Merger, and the basis of
such BAC Common Stock will be the same as such holder's basis in the
Continental Common Stock exchanged therefor. If BAC elects to make the above-
described adjustment within such period, it shall give prompt written notice to
Continental thereof (and the Effective Time shall in such case be the fifth day
following such election by BAC) and of the increase in the cash and BAC Common
Stock which will be delivered to holders of Continental Common Stock and the
per-share values thereof, whereupon no abandonment or termination shall be
deemed to have occurred and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms (except as the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Share Stock
Consideration and the Stock Amount shall have been so increased). If
Continental shall not have made the election to abandon the Merger under
subparagraph (a) above and if BAC shall not have elected to increase the Stock
Amount and make the other adjustments contemplated by the foregoing provisions
of this subparagraph (b), then BAC, in its sole discretion, may elect to change
the method of effecting the business combination with Continental (including
without limitation the provisions as set forth in Article III and Article IV)
if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be

-12-

<PAGE>
desirable, including, without limitation, to provide for (i) a merger of a
wholly owned subsidiary of BAC ("Merger Corporation") with and into
Continental, in which Continental is the surviving corporation, (ii) a merger
of Continental with and into Merger Corporation in which Merger Corporation is
the surviving corporation, or (iii) a sale of all the assets of Continental,
BAC or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that no such change shall
alter or change the amount or the kind of the Merger Consideration to be
received by the holders of Continental Common Stock or Continental Preferred
Stock, as provided for in this Agreement or shall materially delay or impede
satisfaction of the conditions (other than Section 9.2(e)) in Article IX.

(c) Cap on Final BAC Stock Price for Calculation of Per Share Stock and
Cash Consideration. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
the event that the Final BAC Stock Price shall be more than $55.84 (the
"Ceiling Price"), the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Share Stock
Consideration and the Stock Amount which would otherwise result from the
application of the provisions of Section 3.2 shall be deemed to be decreased
appropriately so that the per-share cash and stock consideration that will be
receivable by the holders of the Continental Common Stock shall be the same as
if the Final BAC Stock Price were equal to the Ceiling Price.

(d) Return of Share Certificates. In the event the Final BAC Stock Price
is below the Floor Price and Continental elects to terminate this Agreement
under subparagraph (a) above, and BAC does not elect under subparagraph (b)
above to increase the Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration so as to
prevent such termination, BAC will cause the Exchange Agent to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the prompt return of stock
certificates representing shares of Continental Common Stock submitted with
Election Forms. Certificates representing shares of Continental Common Stock
held directly by holders of Continental Common Stock will be returned by
registered mail. BAC will, and will cause the Exchange Agent to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Continental and holders of
Continental Common Stock to facilitate return of certificates representing
shares of Continental Common Stockholders in the event of such termination,
provided, that return of such certificates other than by registered mail will
only be made at the expense, written direction and risk of the applicable
holders of Continental Common Stock and only if such holders submit at the time
of the Election Deadline a pre-paid, pre-addressed courier envelope to be used
for such purpose (except if such holders arrange to pick up their certificates
in person).

3.5 Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters. If prior to the
Effective Time, (i) Continental shall declare a stock dividend or distribution
upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine the Continental Common
Stock, or declare a dividend, or make a distribution, on the Continental Common
Stock in any security convertible into Continental Common Stock (provided that
no such action may be taken by Continental without BAC's prior written consent
as so provided in Article VII), or (ii) BAC shall declare a stock dividend or
distribution upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine the BAC Common
Stock or declare a dividend, or make a distribution, on the BAC Common Stock in
any security convertible into BAC Common Stock, appropriate adjustment or
adjustments will be made to the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Share
Stock Consideration and the Stock Amount. If at the Effective Time,
Continental shall have outstanding more shares of Continental Common Stock than
are contemplated to be outstanding or subject to option by the representation
and warranty in Section 5.2(a), then, at BAC's election and notwithstanding
other provisions hereof, and without limiting any of its other rights
hereunder, (i) the Stock Amount shall be adjusted so as to deduct from the
reference in the calculation of the Stock Amount to the total number of shares
of Continental Common Stock outstanding at the Determination Date that number
of additional shares of Continental Common Stock which are outstanding over the

3.6 Illustrative Cases. Appendix A hereto illustrates, among other
things, the value to be received per share of Continental Common Stock, whether
in cash or in BAC Common Stock, at varying Final BAC Stock Prices, as well as
the resulting exchange ratios (assuming that the adjustment contemplated by
Section 3.4(b) above is made in certain cases and assuming that the cap
contemplated by Section 3.4(c) above shall be operative in a given case).

3.7 Conversion of Dissenting Continental Stock. If prior to the
Effective Time any stockholder of Continental shall fail to perfect, or shall
effectively withdraw or lose, his or her right to appraisal of and payment for
his or her shares of Dissenting Continental Stock under section 262 of the
DGCL, the Dissenting Continental Stock of such holder shall be treated for
purposes of this Article III like any other shares of outstanding Continental
Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, any holder of Continental Common
Stock shall fail to perfect, or shall effectively withdraw or lose, his or her
right to appraisal of and payment for his or her Dissenting Continental Stock
under section 262 of the DGCL, each share of Dissenting Continental Stock of
such holder shall be converted into cash or BAC Common Stock pursuant to the
election procedures of this Article III and in accordance with the procedures,
and subject to the conditions, set forth in Article IV.

ARTICLE IV

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

4.1 Exchange Procedures. Upon the latest to occur of the Effective Time
and the completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.3, BAC
shall issue to the Exchange Agent the number of shares of BAC Common Stock and
the BAC Mirror Preferred Stock issuable in the Merger and the amount of cash
payable in the Merger; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, BAC shall not issue to the Exchange Agent BAC
Common Stock, BAC Mirror Preferred Stock or cash payable with respect to shares
of Continental Common Stock or Continental Preferred Stock unless and until
share certificates and the required transmittal materials pursuant to Article
III and Article IV have been received in proper form by the Exchange Agent.
The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to BAC Common Stock and BAC Mirror Preferred Stock held
by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.

Promptly after the Effective Time, BAC and Continental shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates theretofore representing shares of Continental Preferred Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange
Agent) to the former holders of Continental Preferred Stock. After completion
of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.3, each holder of a
certificate formerly representing Continental Common Stock or Continental
Preferred Stock who surrenders or has surrendered such certificate (or
customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such certificate), together with duly executed transmittal materials included
in the Election Form, to the Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof, be
entitled to a certificate representing the BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock or cash into which the shares of Continental capital stock
shall have been converted pursuant hereto. BAC shall cause the Exchange Agent
to accept such certificate upon compliance with such reasonable and customary
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal practices. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate representing Continental
capital stock shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to evidence
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.

To the extent provided by Section 3.1(d) of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Continental Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
also shall receive,

-14-

<PAGE>
upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of BAC Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled. BAC shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of Continental capital stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his certificate
or certificates representing shares of Continental capital stock for exchange
as provided in this Article IV. In addition, certificates surrendered for
exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of Continental for purposes
of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), shall not be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of BAC
Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock until BAC has received a written
agreement from such person as provided in Section 8.18. If any certificate for
shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock, or any check
representing cash and/or declared but unpaid dividends, is to be issued in a
name other than that in which a certificate surrendered for exchange is issued,
the certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such exchange shall affix
any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the certificate surrendered or
provide funds for their purchase or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable.

4.2 Voting and Dividends. Former stockholders of record of Continental
shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of BAC
stockholders the number of whole shares of BAC Common Stock into which their
respective shares of Continental Common Stock are converted, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their certificates representing Continental
Common Stock for certificates representing BAC Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance
with the provisions of Section 4.1 of this Agreement, each certificate
theretofore representing shares of Continental capital stock (other than shares
to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) of this Agreement) shall from and
after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive
shares of BAC Common Stock and BAC Mirror Preferred Stock, and/or cash, as set
forth in this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the Effective Time with respect to BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered certificate of Continental capital stock with
respect to the shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.1(d) until the holder of such
certificate of Continental capital stock shall surrender such certificate.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
certificate of Continental capital stock, there shall be paid to the holder of
the certificates representing whole shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror
Preferred Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount
of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of BAC Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(d) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC
Mirror Preferred Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock.

4.3 No Liability. Neither BAC nor Continental shall be liable to any
holder of shares of Continental Common Stock or Continental Preferred Stock for
any such shares of BAC Common Stock or BAC Mirror Preferred Stock (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

4.4 Withholding Rights. BAC or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Continental Common Stock or Continental
Preferred Stock such amounts as BAC or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by BAC or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be

-15-

<PAGE>
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the shares of Continental Common Stock or Continental Preferred Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by BAC or the Exchange
Agent.

(1) it has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and applicable laws and regulations, including ERISA and the

thereunder or would cause the acceleration of any obligation of any party
thereto;

(2) no actions or claims (other than routine claims for benefits
made in the ordinary course of Plan administration for which Plan
administrative review procedures have not been exhausted) are pending,
threatened or imminent against or with respect to the Plan, any employer who

insurance.

(o) With respect to the Plans, individually and in the aggregate, no
event has occurred and, to the knowledge of Continental or any of its

with which Continental or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any liability
on the part of Continental or such Subsidiary (except liability for benefits
claims and funding obligations payable in the ordinary course) under ERISA, the
Code or any other applicable law.

5.13 Subsidiaries. Exhibit 22 to Continental's Annual Report on Form 10-K

in a fiduciary capacity)), apply to this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Continental
has taken all steps necessary to irrevocably exempt the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and by the Stock Option Agreement from any other

liability and other insurance maintained with respect to the assets or

policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof) with
respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time; provided, however, that BAC shall not be obligated to make
annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
200% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by Continental for such
insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere
herein, BAC's agreement set forth above shall be limited to cover claims only
to the extent that those claims are not covered under Continental's directors'
and officers' insurance policies (or any substitute policies permitted by this
Section 8.8(b)).

of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and each Indemnified
Party's heirs and representatives.

8.9 Conversion of Stock Options; Restricted Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Continental Common
Stock pursuant to the Continental Options, except stock appreciation rights
granted under Continental's 1991 Performance Unit Plan (the "Continental 1991
Plan"), which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights with respect to BAC
Common Stock, and BAC shall assume each such Continental Option, in accordance
with the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced, except as provided
below. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each such Continental Option
assumed by BAC may be exercised solely for shares of BAC Common Stock, or cash
to the extent permitted for stock appreciation rights, and may be exercised
during the time provided in accordance with the stock option agreement by which
it is evidenced, provided that (A) Continental Options held by the seven
Continental employees who are parties to existing termination agreements with
Continental (Messrs. Theobald, O'Neill, Huber, Higgins, Sherman, Stocker and
Thompson) may be exercised during the time period provided in accordance with
the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced and, if longer, to the
extent the options are vested as of the Effective Time, within a one-year
period following a termination of employment entitling an optionee to benefits
under such termination agreement, but not to exceed the original term of the
options, and, in addition, (B) the time to exercise options by certain other
employees who receive severance pay under BAC's severance program in accordance
with Section 8.21, which options are vested as of the employees' separation
date, or which would have vested had the employee remained employed during the
particular employee's severance pay period (except for options issued within
six months of such employee's separation date), shall be the time period
provided in accordance with the stock option agreement by which such options
are evidenced and, if longer, one year from the employee's separation date in
accord with and subject to BAC's severance program, as referenced in Section
8.21, not to exceed the original term of the options; provided, however, that
all such extensions of time to exercise options, for anyone, shall be subject
to prohibitions of applicable law or regulatory constraints, (ii) the number of
shares of BAC Common Stock subject to each such Continental Option shall be
equal to the number of shares of Continental Common Stock subject to such
Continental Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Per Share Stock Consideration and (iii) the per share exercise price under each
such Continental Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise
price under each such Continental Option by the Per Share Stock Consideration
and rounding down to the nearest cent; provided, however, that the terms of
each such Continental Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to
further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to the Effective Time.
After the Effective Time, no Continental Option may be exercised for fractional
shares. It is intended that the foregoing assumption shall

-38-

<PAGE>
be undertaken in a manner that will not constitute a "modification," as defined
in section 425 of the Code, as to any stock option which is an "incentive stock
option," as defined in section 422 of the Code. At the Effective Time, all
rights with respect to Continental Common Stock pursuant to stock appreciation
rights granted by Continental under the Continental 1991 Plan, which are
outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be
settled for cash provided that the amount payable for each stock appreciation
right granted in March 1991 shall not exceed $2.62 and the amount payable for
each stock appreciation right granted in April 1991 shall not exceed $0.435.

(b) All restrictions or limitations on transfer with respect to
Continental Common Stock awarded under a Continental Stock Plan or any other
plan, program or arrangement ("Restricted Stock"), to the extent that such
restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, shall remain in full
force and effect with respect to the BAC Common Stock into which such
Restricted Stock is converted pursuant to Article III.

(c) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties,
(i) the provisions of the Continental Stock Plans and any other plan, program
or arrangement pursuant to which Continental may, or may be required to, issue
Continental Common Stock or compensation based on Continental Common Stock,
shall be amended or deleted as of the Effective Time, and (ii) Continental
shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of Continental Options
or any participant in any Continental Stock Plan shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any equity securities of Continental or any of its
Subsidiaries.

8.10 Certain Change of Control Matters.

(a) From and after the date hereof, as generally or specifically
designated in writing by BAC, Continental shall take all action necessary to
the extent permitted under any Plan so that the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby will not (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any employees under any Plan or
otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Plan or (iii)
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits; provided, however, that to the extent Continental has entered into
agreements with respect to stock option awards or stock appreciation rights
which provide for acceleration of vesting upon a change in control, or with
respect to the termination agreements referenced in Section 8.9(a) of this
Agreement, such agreements may remain in effect notwithstanding this section of
the Agreement. Any action taken by Continental pursuant to this Section 8.10
shall not constitute a failure of condition to the obligations of BAC hereunder
or give rise to any right of termination on the part of BAC hereunder.

(b) Each of BAC and Continental shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock
Option Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability
of, any applicable State Takeover Law.

8.11 Termination Payment and Other Matters. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to its terms other than by BAC pursuant to Section 10.2, or
other than by either party pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or other than by
Continental pursuant to Section 10.1(d), and an Acquisition Event shall occur
after the date hereof and within 18 months after the date of such termination,
Continental shall pay promptly, but in no event later than two business days
after the occurrence of such Acquisition Event, by wire transfer of immediately
available Federal Funds to such account as BAC shall designate, the greater of
(i) $60 million and (ii) if applicable, an amount equal to the sum of (A) BAC's
out-of-pocket expenses (and the allocated cost of its in-house legal and
accounting departments) in connection with the transactions hereby contemplated
and (B) 3% of the Aggregate Value of the Acquisition Event (less, however, any
payments received by BAC as a result of section 2.1 of that certain Agreement
dated January 20, 1994 between BAC and Continental). For purposes of this
subsection, the "Aggregate Value" of the Acquisition Event shall be the sum of
(a) the product of (1) the average consideration paid per share of Continental
Common Stock and (2) the sum of (a) the

-39-

<PAGE>
number of such shares outstanding plus (b) the number of such shares issuable
upon exercise of options, warrants or other rights for conversion or exchange
of securities at exercise, conversion or exchange prices per share lower than
the consideration described in (1) above; (b) the product of (1) the average
consideration paid (other than pursuant to clause (c) of this section) per
share of non-convertible preferred stock of Continental and (2) the number of
such shares outstanding; (c) the value of any preferred stock of Continental
assumed or any preferred or common stock redeemed or repurchased in the
transactions involving the Acquisition Event; and (d) the value of any
consideration received by Continental in exchange for any shares of its capital
stock or other securities. For purposes of this subsection, the term
"Acquisition Event" shall mean any of the following: (i) any Person (other
than BAC or any Subsidiary thereof) shall have acquired pursuant to a tender
offer or otherwise beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Continental Common Stock; (ii) Continental or CB shall have
authorized, recommended, proposed or publicly announced an intention to
authorize, recommend or propose, or entered into, an agreement with any Person
(other than BAC or a Subsidiary thereof) to (A) effect a merger, consolidation
or similar transaction involving Continental or CB, (B) sell, lease or
otherwise dispose of assets of Continental or its Subsidiaries representing 15%
or more of the consolidated assets of Continental and its Subsidiaries, or (C)
issue, sell or otherwise dispose of (including by way of merger, consolidation,
share exchange or any similar transaction) securities representing 20% or more
of the voting power of Continental or any Subsidiaries thereof.

8.12 Letter of Continental's Accountants. Continental shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to BAC letters of Price Waterhouse,
Continental's independent auditors, dated a date within two business days
before the date on which the S-4 shall become effective and two business days
before the Closing Date and addressed to BAC, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to BAC, and in scope and substance consistent with applicable
professional standards for letters delivered by independent public accountants
in connection with registration statements similar to the S-4.

8.13 Letter of BAC's Accountants. BAC shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause to be delivered to Continental letters of Ernst & Young, BAC's
independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before the date on
which the S-4 shall become effective and two business days before the Closing
Date and addressed to Continental, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Continental, and in scope and substance consistent with
applicable professional standards for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the S-4.

8.14 Advice of Changes; Government Filings. Each party shall confer on a
regular and frequent basis with the other, report on operational matters and
promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any change or event
(including, without limitation, knowledge of any circumstance involving a
potential unasserted claim) having, or which, insofar as can reasonably be
foreseen, could have, a Material Adverse Effect on such party or which would
cause or constitute a material breach of any of the representations, warranties
or covenants of such party contained herein. BAC and Continental shall file
all reports required to be filed by each of them with the SEC between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time and shall deliver to the other party
copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed (other than
reports filed under section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act). BAC,
Continental, each Subsidiary of Continental that is a bank and Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association ("BofA") shall file all Call Reports
with the appropriate Bank Regulators and all other reports required to be filed
with the Federal Reserve Board between the date hereof and the Effective Time
and shall make available to the other party copies of all such reports promptly
after the same are filed. Except where prohibited by applicable statutes and
regulations, each party shall promptly provide the other (or its counsel) with
copies of all other filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

<PAGE>
8.15 Accounting Methods. Continental shall not change its methods of
accounting in effect at December 31, 1993, except as required by changes in
GAAP as concurred in by its independent auditors. Continental shall not change
its fiscal year.

8.16 Coordination of Dividends. Each of BAC and Continental shall
coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of BAC
Common Stock and Continental Common Stock and the record dates and payment
dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of
BAC Common Stock or Continental Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect
to their shares of BAC Common Stock and/or Continental Common Stock and any
shares of BAC Common Stock any such holder received in exchange therefor in the
Merger.

8.17 Continental Accruals and Reserves. Prior to the Closing Date,
Continental shall review and, to the extent determined necessary or advisable,
consistent with GAAP and the accounting rules, regulations and interpretations
of the SEC and its staff, modify and change its loan, accrual and reserve
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves
and accruals and reserves to (i) reflect the Surviving Corporation's plans with
respect to the conduct of Continental's business following the Merger and (ii)
make adequate provision for the costs and expenses relating thereto) so as to
be applied consistently on a mutually satisfactory basis with those of BAC.
Prior to the Closing, Continental also will adjust loan loss and OREO reserves
as may be appropriate, consistent with GAAP and the accounting rules,
regulations and interpretations of the SEC and its staff, in light of the then
anticipated post-Closing disposition of certain Continental assets. The
parties agree to cooperate in preparing for the implementation of the
adjustments contemplated by this Section 8.17. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Continental shall not be obligated to take in any respect any such action
pursuant to this Section 8.17 (other than pursuant to the preceding sentence)
unless and until BAC acknowledges that all conditions to its obligations to
consummate the Merger have been satisfied.

8.18 Affiliates. At least 40 days prior to the Closing Date, Continental
shall deliver to BAC a letter identifying all persons who are, at the time this
Agreement is submitted for approval to the stockholders of Continental,
"affiliates" of Continental for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
Continental shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each person named in the
letter delivered by it to deliver to BAC prior to the Closing Date a written
"Affiliates" agreement, in customary form, providing that such person shall
dispose of the BAC Common Stock and BAC Mirror Preferred Stock to be received
by such person in the Merger only in accordance with applicable law and, in
addition, in such agreement, such Affiliate shall represent that they have no
present plan or intention to dispose of any such shares of BAC capital stock.

8.19 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either BAC
or Continental, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement shall take all such necessary or appropriate action.

8.20 Intentionally Omitted.

8.21 BAC Severance Benefits. BAC shall adopt, effective as of the
Effective Time, a severance program for Continental employees which is similar
in all material respects to BAC's Merger Transition Program and U.S. Senior
Management Transition Program (which are described in the previously used
brochures attached hereto as Exhibit 8.21) with respect to severance pay and
stock treatment and similar in all material respects to BAC's Employee
Transition Program (as described in the current brochure attached hereto as
Exhibit 8.21) with respect to all other benefits. BAC shall maintain such
severance program in effect for not less than 12 months following the Effective
Time; provided that benefits under such program may be modified or eliminated
earlier if they are of little financial consequence to recipients. Such

-41-

<PAGE>
severance program shall not apply to Continental employees who are party to
termination agreements with Continental.

8.22 Continental Benefit Plans. Continental employee benefit plans will
remain in effect temporarily after the Effective Time. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Continental employee benefit plans will be
discontinued or merged into BAC plans and employees of Continental shall become
eligible for the employee benefit plans of BAC on the same terms as such plans
and benefits are generally offered from time to time to employees of BofA in
comparable positions with BofA. Such employees shall be credited for the years
of service with Continental and its affiliates under the employee benefit plans
to be provided by BAC to such employees, to the same extent such service was
recognized for similar plans of Continental. However, with respect to any
pension benefit plan of BAC, such service will be counted only for purposes of
vesting, eligibility for participation and early retirement and the rate of
prospective benefit accrual. Following the Effective Time, BAC shall have the
same legal rights and legal obligations, which it shall honor, subject to the
terms thereof, as Continental arising under all employment, severance and other
compensation contracts disclosed in the Continental Disclosure Schedule,
including without limitation the obligations arising under the termination
agreements with the seven individuals referred to in Section 8.9(a).

8.23 Continental Internal Audit Function; Peer Review. As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than 90
days after such date, Continental shall cause to be completed (and a written
report thereon furnished to BAC) a peer review with respect to the internal
audit function of Continental (which function has been outsourced to
Continental's independent accounting firm). Such peer review shall be
conducted in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Institute of
Internal Auditors.

8.24 Continental Dividend Reinvestment Plan. As soon as practicable after
the date hereof, Continental shall terminate its dividend reinvestment plan.

8.25 Execution and Delivery of Stock Option Agreement. The parties agree
that the Stock Option Agreement shall be executed and delivered immediately
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

Board of Directors of Continental; or

(b) By the Board of Directors of BAC or the Board of Directors
of Continental if (i) the Federal Reserve Board or the Illinois Commissioner
of Banks and Trust Companies has denied approval of the Merger and such
denial has become final and nonappealable or (ii) the Effective Time does not
occur within 12 months from the date of this Agreement unless the failure of

this Agreement to perform or observe its covenants and agreements set forth
herein required to be performed or observed by such party on or before the
Effective Time; or

(c) By BAC (if it is not in material breach of any of its
obligations hereunder) (i) pursuant to notice in the event of (A) a breach
or failure by Continental that is material in the context of the transactions
contemplated hereby of any covenant or agreement by Continental contained
herein or (B) any inaccuracies or omissions in the representations or
warranties of Continental contained herein the circumstances as to which
either individually or in the aggregate have, or reasonably could be expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Continental (which in any event (and
without limiting the meaning thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred if
involving losses, liabilities (which if contingent could reasonably be
expected to result in loss), costs or expenses of more than $75 million), in
either case which has not been, or cannot be, cured within 30 days after
written notice thereof is given to Continental, or (ii) in the event of any
failure, or, prior to the Closing, any prospective failure on the part of
Continental to fulfill any condition set forth in Section 9.1 or 9.3,
provided that no termination based upon such a prospective failure shall
occur unless BAC has theretofore notified Continental thereof and Continental
has not, within 30 days after receipt of such notice, remedied such
prospective failure; or

(d) By Continental (if it is not in material breach of any of
its obligations hereunder) pursuant to notice in the event of (A) a breach or

(e) By BAC if, after the date hereof, there has occurred any
Material Adverse Effect (or any development or condition that might
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect) with respect
to Continental provided that BAC shall have given 30 days' written notice of
such termination to Continental and Continental shall not have remedied such
event by the end of such 30-day period; or

-46-

<PAGE>
(f) By BAC if, after the date hereof, any Person (other than BAC
or any Subsidiary thereof) shall become the beneficial owner of 20% or more

(other than BAC or a Subsidiary thereof) shall have commenced a bona fide
tender offer or exchange offer to acquire at least 20% of the then
outstanding shares of Continental Common Stock.

10.2 Special BAC Rights of Termination. Continental shall deliver to BAC
all remaining portions of the Continental Disclosure Schedule not heretofore
delivered to BAC as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.
Notwithstanding any investigation made by or information known to BAC prior to

recognition of the fact that BAC, as of the date hereof, has not had an
opportunity to complete its due diligence review of Continental and that
Continental has not, as of the date hereof, delivered to BAC all portions of
the Continental Disclosure Schedule, in addition to the termination rights set
forth in Section 10.1, BAC shall have the following rights (the "Special

BAC of all such remaining portions of the Continental Disclosure Schedule in
form and detail of presentation reasonably satisfactory to BAC, to terminate
this Agreement in its sole discretion; and (ii) at any time after the date of
this Agreement through and including the date that is 30 days after the date
Continental delivers to BAC all remaining portions of the Continental

which, in the reasonable business judgment of the Board of Directors (which

contemplated by this Agreement, (x) be inconsistent in any material and adverse
respect with any of the representations and warranties of Continental contained
in this Agreement, (y) materially and adversely affect the business,
operations, properties, financial condition, results of operations or prospects

Termination Rights by written notice to Continental pursuant to Section 11.6.

10.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination and
abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2, this Agreement
shall become void and have no effect, except that (i) the provisions of Section
11.1 shall survive any such termination and abandonment, (ii) the Stock Option
Agreement shall be governed by its own terms as to termination and (iii) no
party shall be relieved or released from any liability arising out of an
intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement and Continental shall not
be relieved of any obligation it may have under Section 8.11.

10.4 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants Following
the Effective Time. Except for Articles III and IV and Sections 8.8, 8.9,
8.11, 8.19, 8.21, 8.22, Section 10.5(b) and Article XI, none of the respective

conditions of this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby, will be
paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(c)
or (d), and without limiting any rights BAC may have under Section 8.11, the

<PAGE>
hereby, including the preparation, printing, filing, shipping, and distribution
of the S-4 and the Proxy Statement and the pursuit of the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals (such fees and expenses to include all legal, consulting and
accounting fees, disbursements and expenses). To the extent any such expenses
are reimbursed pursuant to this Section 10.5(b), such payments shall be
credited against any similar obligations of Continental under Section 8.11.

10.6 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger
by the stockholders of Continental or of BAC, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

10.7 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

ARTICLE XI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1 Expenses. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing or as
otherwise provided herein, each party hereto shall bear its own expenses
incident to preparing, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and to
consummating the Merger.

11.2 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and
except for that certain Agreement dated January 20, 1994 between BAC and
Continental and except for that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated
December 16, 1993, between BAC and Continental, this Agreement and the Stock
Option Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, and such
agreements supersede all prior arrangements or understandings with respect
thereto, written or oral. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their
respective successors. Other than Sections 8.8, 8.20, 8.21 and 8.22, nothing
in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
individual, corporation or other entity, other than BAC, Continental, Merger
Corporation or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations
or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

11.3 Amendments. To the extent permitted by law, this Agreement may be
amended by a subsequent writing signed by each of BAC and Continental,
provided, however, that the provisions hereof relating to the manner or basis
in which shares of Continental capital stock will be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration shall not be amended after the Stockholders' Meeting without any
requisite approval of the holders of the issued and outstanding shares of
Continental capital stock entitled to vote thereon.

11.4 Waivers. Prior to or at the Effective Time, each of BAC and
Continental shall have the right to waive any default in the performance of any
term of this Agreement by the other, to waive or extend the time for the
compliance or fulfillment by the other of any and all of the other's
obligations under this Agreement and to waive any or all of the conditions
precedent to its obligations under this Agreement, except any condition which,
if not satisfied, would result in the violation of any law or applicable
governmental regulation. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any
right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a

-48-

<PAGE>
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy
or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy or power provided herein or by law or in
equity. The waiver by any party of the time for performance of any act or
condition hereunder does not constitute a waiver of the act or condition
itself.

11.5 No Assignment. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its
rights or delegate any of its obligations (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) under this Agreement to any other person or entity. Any such
purported assignment or delegation that is made without the prior written
consent of the other parties to this Agreement shall be void and of no effect.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.5, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

11.6 Notices. All notices or other communications which are required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by overnight
courier or by facsimile transmission (and confirmed by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid) to the persons at the addresses or facsimile
transmission numbers set forth below (or at such other address or facsimile
transaction numbers as may be provided hereunder), and shall be deemed to have

11.7 Specific Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
the failure of Continental to fulfill any of its covenants and agreements
hereunder, including the failure to take all such actions as are necessary on
its part to cause the consummation of the Merger, will cause irreparable injury
to BAC for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, Continental hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief
by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of Continental's
obligations and to the granting by any such court of the remedy of the specific
performance by Continental of its obligations hereunder.

11.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

11.9 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereby submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and the
Federal courts of the United States of America located in Delaware in respect
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option
Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Stock Option Agreement, that it is not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said
courts or that the Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement may not be enforced
in or by said courts or that its property is exempt or immune from execution,
that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or
that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper.

11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
