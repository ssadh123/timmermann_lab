FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Tulsa, Oklahoma, June 13, 1994: MAPCO Alaska Petroleum Inc. (MAPI), an
affiliated subsidiary of MAPCO Inc. (MAPCO), located in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
announced today that it has received an adverse ruling in its litigation against
the State of Alaska with regard to retroactive price adjustments under MAPI's
1978 royalty oil purchase agreement.

On August 28, 1992, MAPI commenced suit against the State, in an Anchorage State
Court, seeking a declaratory judgement that MAPI is not liable to the State for
any retroactive price increase under the 1978 agreement. MAPI and the State
subsequently filed summary judgement motions addressing core contract
interpretation issues. In response to these motions, the ruling states that MAPI
is liable for retroactive royalty oil price adjustments, subject only to further
review by the Court as to retroactive interest due, if any. The ruling,
supporting the State's $98 million claim against MAPI, fifty percent (50%) of
which is retroactive interest, is subject to additional defenses that MAPI is
entitled to raise at a scheduled 1995 trial. Therefore, the outcome of this
litigation is not final, and MAPI is presently considering all its options.

A final resolution of the litigation consistent with the Court's ruling would
result in material liabilities which have not been fully reflected in MAPCO's
consoldiated financial statements. MAPCO is currently evaluating the adequacy of
its accruals in this matter. If MAPI is required to make payments to the State,
it has contractual rights to defer those payments over an extended period of
time.
