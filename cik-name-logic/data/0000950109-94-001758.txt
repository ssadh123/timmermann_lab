Item 5. Other Events.

On September 15, 1994, Torchmark Corporation ("Torchmark") and American 
Income Holding, Inc. ("American Income") signed a definitive Agreement and Plan 
of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which a Torchmark subsidiary has
commenced a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding common stock of 
American Income for $35 in cash per share of American Income common stock. Any 
shares of American Income common stock not tendered in the tender offer will be 
purchased for cash at $35 per share pursuant to a statutory merger. The tender 
offer is subject to a condition that Torchmark acquire at least 51% of the 
outstanding shares of American Income common stock on a fully diluted basis. The
tender offer and merger are also subject to approval by all necessary insurance 
regulatory authorities and other customary conditions. Holders of approximately 
41% of the American Income shares, including Bernard Rapoport, the Chairman of 
the Board of American Income, Charles B. Cooper, the President of American 
Income, and Golder, Thoma, Cressey Fund III Limited Partnership, have agreed to 
tender their shares to Torchmark and have granted Torchmark an option to acquire
their shares under certain conditions.

Torchmark intends to finance the acquisition with a combination of the 
proceeds of a proposed public offering of monthly income preferred securities

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
American Income Holding, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of American Income
Holding, Inc. as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
financial statement schedules as listed in the accompanying index. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American
Income Holding, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

AMERICAN INCOME HOLDING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of American
Income Holding, Inc. (Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Trust Life
Insurance Company (TLIC) and American Income Life Insurance Company (AILIC).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company is an insurance holding company engaged through its
subsidiaries, TLIC, a Texas domiciled stock life company, and AILIC, an Indiana
domiciled stock life company, in the marketing, underwriting and issuing of
individual life and accident and health insurance. Through an agency force
which sells exclusively for the Company, it markets policies principally to
members of labor unions, credit unions and other employment related
associations.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents

For the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand and in banks, and all time and certificates of deposit with original
maturities of three months or less.

(c) Investments

Investments are recorded on the following basis except when an investment's
decline in value is other than temporary, at which time the decrease in value is
recognized currently as a realized investment loss. Realized gains or losses on
sales of investments, determined on a specific identification basis, are
included in revenue.

. Management generally acquires fixed maturities with the intention to hold
such investments to maturity. The investment strategies of the Company are
developed based on many factors including rate of return, maturity, credit
risk, tax considerations and regulatory requirements. Although the Company
has the ability and intent to hold all of its investments to maturity,
effective December 31, 1992, all fixed maturities are considered as held
available for sale (carried at the lower of the aggregate amortized cost or
market value as of the balance sheet date) to preserve management's
prerogative to sell individual securities if deemed necessary to support the
Company's investment strategies.

. Common stocks and nonredeemable preferred stocks are carried at market. Net
unrealized gains (losses) (differences between cost and market) are
reflected in stockholders' equity.

. Mortgage loans on real estate are carried at amortized cost, less allowance

(d) Policy Acquisition Costs and Cost of Insurance Acquired

The costs of acquiring new business, principally commissions and certain
policy underwriting and issue costs, all of which vary with and are primarily
related to the production of new business, have been deferred. Deferred
acquisition costs for ordinary life policies are being amortized in proportion
to the premium income over the lives of the related policies. Deferred
acquisition costs relating to accident and health policies are being amortized
over 20 years or the benefit period, if shorter.

The value of insurance acquired at May 1, 1989, which is included in the
cost of insurance acquired in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, was based upon the defined valuation premium method with the defined
premium equal to 90% of the gross premium. The cost of insurance acquired for
ordinary life policies is being amortized in proportion to the premium income
over the lives of the related policies. The cost of insurance acquired relating
to accident and health policies is being amortized over 20 years or the benefit
period, if shorter.

Deferred acquisition costs and cost of insurance acquired are reviewed for
recoverability from future premium income and such capitalized costs that are
deemed not recoverable are expensed in the period in which the determination is
made.

(e) Goodwill

Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years.

(f) Future Policy Benefits

The liability for future policy benefits is computed by the net level
premium method, based upon estimated future investment yield, mortality and/or
morbidity and withdrawal rates.

(g) Policy and Contract Claims

The liability for policy and contract claims is based on the estimated
ultimate cost of settling the claims, using past experience adjustments for
current claim trends.

(h) Foreign currency translation

For foreign operations (Canada), the balance sheet accounts are translated
into U.S. Dollars at the period end exchange rate and income and expense items
are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Exchange gains and losses are not material.

(i) Premium Revenue

Premiums are recognized as revenue over the premium paying period. Benefits
and expenses are matched with earned premiums so as to result in the recognition
of income over the term of the contract. This matching is accomplished by means
of the provision for liabilities for future policy benefits and the amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs.

(j) Income Taxes

The Company files a separate Federal income tax return whereas the
subsidiaries, TLIC and AILIC, file a consolidated tax return. In February 1992,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Statement 109
requires a change from the deferred method of accounting for income taxes of APB
Opinion 11 to the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax asset and
liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

The Company adopted Statement 109 in 1992 and has applied the provisions of
Statement 109 retroactively to January 1, 1991. The cumulative effect of the
change in the method of accounting for income taxes as of January 1, 1991 is
reported separately in the 1991 consolidated statement of earnings (see note 6).

(k) Net earnings per common share

Net earnings per common share are computed by dividing net earnings
applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during each period. The weighted
average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents used in
the calculation of net earnings per common share was 11,507,019, 15,219,826 and
16,077,516 for the years ended December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively.

(2) The Offering and the Recapitalization

In March 1992, the Company completed an initial public offering of 4,000,000
shares of its common stock for $19.00 per share (the Offering), resulting in net
proceeds of $70,197,000. Concurrent with the Offering, the Company's 15%
redeemable preferred stock and accumulated dividends of $6,441,000 were
converted into common stock at the public offering price ($19.00) and all shares
of Class B common stock were converted into shares of common stock, resulting in
the Company having only one class outstanding, the voting common stock. The
Company also entered into a new credit facility (the New Credit Facility) with a
syndicate of lending institutions (collectively, the Banks), pursuant to which
the Banks provided an aggregate of $105.0 million under a new secured revolving
loan facility, which, together with the proceeds of the Offering and additional
corporate funds, enabled the Company to retire (i) the Subordinated Notes at
104.0% of the aggregate remaining principal amount thereof and (ii) the
indebtedness under the then existing credit agreement. These various
recapitalization transactions (collectively, the Recapitalization) were
consummated simultaneously with each other and simultaneously with the Offering
(see note 5).

At December 31, 1992 and 1993, the Company had investments in collateralized
mortgage obligations-PAC-IO certificates of $24,948,000 and $19,325,000,
respectively, that are considered high risk because there is potential for loss
of a significant portion of the original investment due to changes in interest
rates and the prepayment rates of the underlying assets. The weighted average
effective yield that has been used to establish carrying values for these
securities at December 31, 1992 and 1993 was 3.1% and 1.7%, respectively.

During 1992 and 1993, proceeds from sales of investments in fixed maturities
were approximately $69,229,000 and $9,852,000, respectively.

Market values for fixed maturities and equity securities at December 31, 1992

As of December 31, 1992 and 1993, investments which were non-income producing
during the previous twelve months included fixed maturities aggregating $242,000
and $0, respectively. At December 31, 1992 and 1993, there were approximately
$3,824,000 and $3,824,000, respectively, of mortgage and other loans categorized
by management as nonaccrual loans because collection of interest was not
certain.

In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan" which is effective for the Company's fiscal year ended
December 31, 1993. The effect of the provisions of this statement is not
significant to the consolidated financial statements.

In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB 115). FASB 115 will change the
Company's method of accounting for available for sale securities from the lower
of cost or market method to the fair value method. Unrealized holding gains and
losses on the Company's fixed maturity investments, all of which are classified
as available for sale, shall be reported as a net amount in a separate component
of shareholders' equity until realized. The Company intends to adopt FASB 115
in Fiscal 1994. Thus, on January 1, 1994, the effect of applying this new
accounting standard will increase stockholders' equity by $7.4 million, or $0.47
per share and cause a charge to net earnings by $1.5 million or $0.10 per share
reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

In March 1992, the Company replaced its senior and subordinated borrowings
outstanding with the New Credit Facility totaling $105,000,000 along with the
proceeds of the Offering (see note 2). On December 30, 1993, the Company signed
a commitment letter committing the Company to sign an agreement (the Revolving
Credit Agreement) with a group of banks to refinance the New Credit Facility
(see note 14). On January 11, 1994, the Revolving Credit Agreement was signed.
The Revolving Credit Agreement has an original principal amount of $80,000,000
and bears interest at the Company's option of (i) 0.75% per annum over the
Interbank Eurodollar rate or (ii) the greater of 0.75% per annum over the

There are various debt covenants associated with the Revolving Credit
Agreement noted above. These covenants require, among other things, that the
Company and its subsidiaries maintain certain levels of statutory surplus and
comply with certain debt to equity and operating ratios. The Company is in
compliance with these covenants. Additionally, the Company has the option to
temporarily reduce the amount outstanding on the note at any time, subject to
certain limitations. The Company pays a 1/4% commitment fee on the average
daily unused portions of the Revolving Credit Agreement.

(6) Federal Income Taxes

As discussed in note 1, the Company adopted Statement 109 as of January 1,
1991. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes of

income tax rate from 34% to 35% beginning January 1, 1993. One effect of this
retroactive change in tax law was a charge of $1.7 million, reflected in Federal
income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1993, to adjust the net deferred

Federal income tax benefits related to realized investment gains (losses)
were $140,000, $889,000 and $81,000 for the years ended December 31, 1991, 1992
and 1993, respectively.

Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (1984 Act), a portion of a life
insurance company's income was not subject to tax until it was distributed to
stockholders, at which time it was taxed at the regular corporate tax rate. In
accordance with the 1984 Act this income, referred to as policyholders' surplus,
would not increase, yet any amounts distributed would be taxable at the regular
corporate rate. The balance of this account as of December 31, 1993 is
approximately $8,000,000. No provision for deferred Federal income taxes has
been made on this amount, as management is of the opinion that no distribution
to stockholders will be made from policyholders' surplus in the foreseeable
future.

(7) Reinsurance

AILIC reinsures portions of certain life insurance policies that it
underwrites to limit disproportionate risks. AILIC retains varying amounts of
individual insurance up to a maximum retention on any one life of: (i) the face
amount of the policy if less than $160,000 or (ii) $150,000 for all policies
having a face amount of $160,000 or more. Amounts not retained are ceded to The
Lincoln National Life Insurance Company on an automatic or facultative basis.
Although the reinsurance of risk does not relieve the ceding insurer of its
original liability to its policyholder, it is the industry practice of insurers
for financial statement purposes to treat the reinsured risks as though they
were risks for which the ceding insurer was only contingently liable. A
contingent liability exists with respect to the aforementioned reinsurance
arrangements which may become a liability of AILIC in the event the reinsurers
are unable to meet obligations assumed by them under the reinsurance contracts.
At December 31, 1992 and 1993, the amount of life insurance in force ceded was
not significant.

In December 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 113, "Accounting and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts" which
is effective for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 1993. The
provisions of this Statement are immaterial to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements of the Company and, accordingly, have not been applied.

(8) Redeemable Preferred Stock

At December 31, 1991, the Company had 425 shares of nonvoting 15% Cumulative
Preferred Stock ("preferred stock") with a par value of $.01 per share issued
and outstanding and a liquidation preference of $10,000 per share plus accrued
and unpaid dividends. Dividends were cumulative and accrued semi-annually, from
the date of issuance, on each share of preferred stock at an annual rate of
$1,500.

On the consummation of the Offering in March 1992 (see note 2), the
aggregate redemption price of the preferred stock ($6,441,000) was converted
into 338,976 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $19.00 per
share. The Company presently has 425 authorized shares of preferred stock, none
of which is issued.

(9) Stockholders' Equity

On December 16, 1991, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a 1,000
to 1 stock split of each share of the Company's common stock and Class B common
stock. The stock split was consummated simultaneously with the Offering and
other related transactions (see note 2). The accompanying financial statements
have been retroactively restated to reflect the results of this stock split.

In conjunction with the 1989 acquisition of AILIC, 2,569,600 shares of Class
B common stock were issued to the creditors. This stock was convertible to
common stock based on a ratio that yielded approximately one share of common
stock for every share of Class B common stock. On September 10, 1991, a holder
of Class B common shares exercised its right to convert 1,460,000 shares to
common stock. In March 1992, the remaining 1,109,600 shares of Class B common
stock were converted into shares of common stock simultaneously with the
Offering and other related transactions (see note 2).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

In 1989, the Company granted options to an officer to purchase 584,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.14 per share. In 1991, the
Company granted options to another officer to purchase 117,980 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $7.00 per share. Both options vest evenly over a
five-year period of continuous employment, although the options with the $7.00
per share exercise price required a period of one year before the beginning of
the five year vesting period. During 1992, options for 275,644 shares
(including nonqualified options for 210,216 shares) were exercised at $2.14 per
share. During 1993, options exercised were for 23,596 shares at $7.00 per share
and 2,350 shares at $2.14 per share. The Company derives a tax deduction
measured by the excess of the market value over the option price at the date
nonqualified options are exercised. The related tax benefit of $1,290,000 and
$63,000 in 1992 and 1993, respectively, have been credited to additional paid in
capital. Options to purchase 189,206 shares at $2.14 per share are exercisable
at December 31, 1993.

Under prior Indiana State Insurance law, all dividends on capital stock
could be paid only to the extent that assets exceed liabilities and the dividend
payment does not reduce statutory surplus below 50% of stated capital.
Furthermore, without prior approval, dividends could not be declared or
distributed that exceeded the greater of ten percent (10%) of AILIC's surplus,
as shown by its last annual statement, or the net gain from operations for such
period. Effective July 1, 1991, Indiana state laws were amended. Under the
current law, unless the Indiana Department of Insurance approves an
extraordinary dividend in a greater amount, Indiana law limits dividend payments
by insurance companies to their holding companies in any twelve month period to
the lesser of statutory gain from operations for the preceding year or 10% of
statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. During 1992 and 1993, AILIC
paid dividends of $20,075,000 and $25,541,223, respectively, which were approved
by the Indiana Department of Insurance. AILIC has obtained approval from the
Indiana Department of Insurance to pay dividends of up to $25.5 million during
calendar year 1994.

(10) Pension Plan

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit plan for all hourly
employees who have completed one year of service with the Company. The benefits
are set as a monthly benefit for each year of service with the Company. The
Company's funding experience has been to contribute annually the maximum amount
that can be deducted for Federal income tax purposes. The Company does not
provide post-retirement or post-employment benefits to its employees other than
through this pension plan.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting
for Pensions," was effective in 1987. Management is of the opinion that the
change in assumptions required to comply with Statement No. 87 would not have a
material financial impact on the Company and, therefore, has not valued the Plan
in accordance with this Statement.

The unfunded liability for past service cost was $156,000 as of January 1,
1993 and is being amortized over 10 years. The assumed rate of return used in
determining the present value of accumulated plan benefits was 8% in all years.
Total pension expense was $53,000, $54,000 and $54,000, respectively, for the
years ended December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993.

(11) Lines of Business

The Company operates primarily in two lines of business within the life
insurance industry: life insurance and accident and health insurance. Financial
data with respect to these lines of business and corporate operations is set
forth below (in thousands):

(12) Statutory Capital and Surplus

The Company's insurance subsidiaries are required to file statutory financial
statements with state regulatory authorities. Accounting principles used to
prepare the statutory statements differ from the generally accepted accounting
principles used to prepare these consolidated financial statements. These
differences relate primarily to deferred acquisition costs expensed for
statutory purposes but deferred under generally accepted accounting principles
and surplus debentures accounted for as surplus for statutory purposes and as
intercompany indebtedness that is eliminated for generally accepted accounting
principles.

Reconciliations of statutory net income as determined using statutory
accounting principles, to the amount included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993 are

(13) Contingencies

The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary
course of operations. Also, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its
examination of the Company's Federal income tax returns through 1988 and has
proposed certain tax adjustments. Management is of the opinion, after reviewing
these matters with legal and tax counsel, that the ultimate liability, if any,
resulting from these matters would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position.

(14) Extraordinary Charges

The completion of the Recapitalization (see note 2) resulted in an
extraordinary charge of $4,885,000 (net of the income tax benefit of $2,516,000)
consisting of (i) the write-off of unamortized expenses capitalized and included
with goodwill in connection with debt financing incurred to acquire American
Income Life Insurance Company in 1989 and (ii) the prepayment premium of $1.0
million on the 13.25% subordinated notes paid in March 1992.

The signing on December 30, 1993 of the commitment letter for the Revolving
Credit Agreement resulted in an extraordinary charge of $638,000 (net of the
income tax effect of $344,000) consisting of the write-off of the unamortized
portion of the expenses incurred and capitalized in connection with the securing
of the New Credit Facility in March, 1992.

AMERICAN INCOME HOLDING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

(15) Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments" (Statement 107), requires that the Company
disclose estimated fair value for its financial instruments. Where estimation of
fair value is not practicable, the reasons for not estimating fair value and
certain additional information regarding the financial instrument is to be
disclosed. Statement 107 specifically excludes non investment type insurance
contracts from fair value disclosure requirements.

As discussed in note 3, fair values for fixed maturities and common and
preferred stocks were obtained from National Association of Insurance
Commissioners valuation designations, independent brokers and published
valuation guides.

Mortgage and other loans are secured principally by commercial real estate
and equity securities, respectively, and generally have interest rates that
float with the prime lending rate. The weighted average interest rate for these
loan portfolios as of December 31, 1992 and 1993 was 8.2% with maturities
ranging from 1994 to 2022, as of December 31, 1993. Current market conditions
in real estate and commercial lending preclude the estimation of fair value
based on comparable portfolio sales or on discounted cash flows for similar
loans. Management believes that reported amounts approximate fair value due to
the floating interest rates on most of the loans.

Policy loans have weighted average interest rates of 6.4% and 6.5% as of
December 31, 1992 and 1993, respectively, and have no specified maturity dates.
These loans are an integral part of the life insurance policies which the
Company has in force and cannot be valued separately.

At December 31, 1992 and 1993, other policyholder funds included interest
bearing deposit type accounts of $49.8 million and $57.5 million, respectively,
representing amounts payable on demand. Under Statement 107, the fair value of
such deposit type accounts is equal to the amount payable on demand.

Notes payable are discussed in note 5. Management believes that the
reported amounts as of December 31, 1992 and 1993 approximate fair value due to
the floating interest rates that approximate available interest rates on
currently offered debt with similar remaining maturities.

For cash and cash equivalents, agents' debit balances and accounts
receivable, receivables and payables included in other assets and liabilities
and Federal income taxes payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments.

American Income Holding, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation

The financial statements included herein have been prepared by the
Registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally required under generally accepted accounting
principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. It is
suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993.
However, this information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of
normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods. The
results of operations for the six month period ended June 30, 1994, are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

2. Federal Income Taxes

On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the
"Act") was enacted. The Act retroactively increased the Company's marginal
Federal income tax rate from 34% to 35% beginning January 1, 1993. The
effect of this retroactive change in tax law was reported as a charge of
$2.0 million reflected in Federal income taxes for the quarter ended
September 30, 1993. Previous quarters have not been restated to give effect
to this retroactive tax rate increase. Therefore, for financial reporting
purposes, the applicable U.S. Federal income tax rate for the first and
second quarters of 1993 was 34.0% as compared to 35.0% for subsequent
periods.

3. Change in Accounting Principle

In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement No. 115 "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (FASB 115). Beginning January 1,
1994, FASB 115 changed the Company's method of accounting for fixed
maturity investments that are available for sale from the lower of cost or
market method to the fair value method. Unrealized investment gains and
losses (net of tax effect) on the Company's fixed maturity investments, all
of which are classified as available for sale, are now reported as a net
amount in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Thus, on January 1,
1994, the net unrealized investment gain of applying this new accounting
standard increased stockholders' equity by $7.4 million, or $0.47 per
share. As of June 30, 1994, due to an increase in the market level of
interest rates, the net unrealized investment loss was $5.1 million, or
$0.32 per share.

Prior to 1994, generally accepted accounting principles required that
whenever the future undiscounted cash flows of certain investments,
including the Company's investment in "planned amortization class interest
only certificates" ("PAC-IO certificates"), are expected to be less than
book value, the book value of such investments must be written down to an
amount equal to the sum of undiscounted future cash flows, thereby
producing

5
<PAGE>

no yield in future periods unless actual future cash payments received
exceed the expected cash flow estimated in computing the write down. FASB
115 changed this rule to require that such investments should be carried at
values that produce the same yields as risk-free investments with
comparable maturities. Since the PAC-IO certificates had been yielding less
than the risk free rate, it was necessary to reduce their carrying value by
$2.3 million ($1.5 million, net of tax effect), causing a charge to net
earnings on January 1, 1994 of $1.5 million or $0.09 per share reported in
the first quarter of 1994 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.

4. Stockholders' Equity

Foreign currency translation: For foreign operations (Canada), the balance
sheet accounts are translated at the current period exchange rate and
income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the
period. The resulting translation adjustments are made directly to a
separate component of stockholders' equity. Exchange gains and losses are
not material.

Net unrealized investment gain/loss, net of tax effect: See discussion 
concerning implementation of FASB 115 in note 3 above.

5. Contingencies

In 1992, when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination
of the Company's federal income tax returns through 1988 and proposed
certain tax adjustments, the Company protested the proposed adjustments to
the IRS Regional Appeals Office. All issues, except one that will now be
litigated, were settled during the appeal process. The Company's tax
advisor has indicated that the Company's position should prevail. An
unfavorable decision would result in a charge to earnings, but would not
have a material effect on the Company's financial position. Since the
matter involves, in essence, the timing for a deduction, an adverse
judgement would delay deductibility, resulting in a net effect equal to the
interest rate/opportunity cost during the period from the Company's
original deduction to the date of actual deduction. The net present value
of such effect would not be material.

6. Refinancing

On December 30, 1993, the Company committed to a new revolving credit
agreement that provided for the refinancing of the Company's $80 million of
outstanding indebtedness on more favorable terms, including a reduction in
interest rate by 75 basis points, increased flexibility for common stock
dividend payments and lower recurring annual fees.

7. Reclassification

Certain amounts in the accompanying 1993 interim financial statements have 
been reclassified to conform with the 1994 presentation.

TORCHMARK CORPORATION
AND
AMERICAN INCOME HOLDING, INC.

PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet as of
June 30, 1994 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statements of
income for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six month period ended
June 30, 1994 give effect to the acquisition of American Income by Torchmark
and to the related pro forma adjustments described in the notes to such pro
forma financial statements. This transaction will be accounted for as a
purchase by Torchmark and will be reported from the date of acquisition of
control of American Income in Torchmark's consolidated financial statements.
These pro forma financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the
results which would actually have been obtained if the acquisition had been
effected as of the beginning of the periods for which the statements are shown
or which may be obtained in the future.

These pro forma financial statements have been prepared based on estimates
and assumptions deemed appropriate at the present time. The final
determination of the effect of the purchase on Torchmark's earnings and
balance sheet will be based on a more exact calculation of the value of
American Income's net assets as of the actual purchase date, and other
relevant factors, including refinements of estimates resulting from further
analyses. These pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the historical financial statements of Torchmark and American Income
incorporated by reference or included elsewhere herein.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

(a) The pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet as of June 30, 1994
assumes that the acquisition of American Income has occurred as of June 30,
1994 and that as of such date American Income's assets and liabilities were
adjusted to fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that such adjustments to fair value would have been equivalent
to the adjustments made as of the purchase date. The pro forma consolidated
condensed statements of income assume that the purchase of American Income and
the comparable adjustments were made as of the beginning of the pro forma
periods.

(b) The pro forma statements assume the issuance of $200 million of Series A
Preferred Securities, $175 million debt, and the sale of investments to
provide cash to purchase the stock.

(c) For purposes of determining the pro forma effect of the acquisition of
American Income on Torchmark's consolidated balance sheet, American Income's
net assets have been adjusted to fair value as follows:

(1) Investments were recorded at estimated market values.

(2) Policy reserves were adjusted based on actuarial estimates using
current assumptions (including provision for adverse deviation), as to
expected mortality, withdrawals, expenses and interest.

(3) The cost of insurance acquired, which represents the present value of
future profits or acquired insurance in force, was determined based on
assumptions consistent with those utilized in restating insurance reserves
as discussed in (2) above.

(4) Deferred acquisition costs were eliminated.

(5) Deferred income taxes were adjusted to reflect the revaluation of the
above items.

(6) The fair value of other assets and liabilities approximated book
value.

(7) Goodwill was recorded to represent the difference in the purchase
price and the fair value of net assets acquired.

(d) The principal adjustments in the pro forma statements of income
recognize the following items in adjusting American Income's historical
income:

(1) Additions to insurance reserves utilized assumptions described in
Note (c)(2) above.

(2) The cost of insurance acquired was amortized over the estimated
remaining premium-paying period of the insurance in force at the assumed
dates of the acquisition, which is substantially the same in amount as
historical policy acquisition costs.

(3) Additional interest expense, dividends, and reduced investment income
were recorded to give effect to the purchase. Torchmark anticipates
entering into interest rate swap agreements in the same amount as the
Series A Preferred Securities and interest has been assumed to be swapped
to a variable rate.

(4) Goodwill was amortized over a period of 40 years.

(5) Pro forma federal income tax adjustments were based on the above pro
forma adjustments.
