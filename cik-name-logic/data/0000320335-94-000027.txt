Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On September 15, 1994, Torchmark Corporation ("Torchmark"),
its wholly-owned subsidiary, TMK Acquisition Corporation ("TMK
Acquisition") and American Income Holding, Inc. ("American
Income") executed a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Torchmark would acquire
American Income for $35 in cash per share of American Income
common stock utilizing a cash tender offer and a subsequent
statutory merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on
September 21, 1994, TMK Acquisition commenced a cash tender
offer (the "Tender Offer") for all the outstanding common stock
of American Income for $35 per share in cash, net to the seller. 
The Tender Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
October 28, 1994. Thereafter, TMK Acquisition accepted for
payment and paid for all 15,643,838 American Income shares,
representing approximately 99.4% of the outstanding American
Income stock, which were properly tendered in the Tender Offer. 
Subsequently, on November 10, 1994, TMK Acquisition effected a
statutory merger (the "Merger") with American Income, in which
American Income was the surviving corporation, and thus will
acquire all the remaining American Income common stock, 92,728
shares, at a price of $35 per share in cash and without
interest. 

The $35 per share price for American Income common stock
paid in the Tender Offer and Merger was arrived at after
extensive arms-length negotiation among the parties to the
Merger Agreement. Additionally, the Board of Directors of
American Income received a fairness opinion on the transaction
from its financial advisor, Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc.

The total amount of funds required to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of American Income and to pay
fees and expenses related to the Acquisition and Merger has been
estimated to be approximately $565 million. The Acquisition and
Merger have been funded by a combination of internally generated
funds ($190 million), the sale of Monthly Income Preferred
Securities (approximately $200 million) and bank financing
obtained through The First National Bank of Chicago ($175
million).
