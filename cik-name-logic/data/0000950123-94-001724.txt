ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On October 12, 1994, the Registrant, through wholly owned subsidiaries,
purchased Nobel's Pharma Chemistry Business (the "Business") from Akzo Nobel
(the "Seller") for approximately $130 million. The Business consists of Nobel
Chemicals A.B., in Karlskoga, Sweden, Profarmaco Nobel S.r.l. in Milan, Italy,
and sales companies in Germany, the U.K., and the U.S.. Sales of the group in
1993 were approximately $90 million and operating cash flow (EBITDA) was
approximately $18 million. Sales were 60% bulk active ingredients for
pharmaceutical products and 40% fine chemicals. The purchase price was
determined by arm's length negotiations between the Seller and the Registrant.
There is no material relationship between the Seller and the Registrant and, to
the best knowledge of the Registrant, there is no material relationship between
the Seller and any of the Registrant's affiliates, directors or officers or any
associates of any of its directors or officers.

The funds used by the Registrant for the acquisition were supplied from
borrowings under a new $225 million credit facility provided by a group of
banks with NBD Bank, N.A., as agent.

The Business was acquired by purchase of the stock of the Companies
noted above, with substantial indemnifications from the Seller. The Business
is involved in the manufacture and sales of pharmaceutical active ingredients
and intermediates, and specialty and fine chemicals. The Registrant intends to
continue such operations.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

The Company entered into a new Loan Agreement (Credit Agreement) on
September 21, 1994 with NBD Bank, N.A., United Jersey Bank, National
Westminster Bank NJ, Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A., BHF-Bank, The First
National Bank of Boston, Chemical Bank New Jersey, N.A., and National City
Bank. This new Loan Agreement replaces the existing Revolving Credit and Term
Loan Agreement with NBD Bank, N.A., United Jersey Bank, and National
Westminster Bank NJ. The new Credit Agreement provides for a bridge loan in
the aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000, a term loan in the aggregate
principal amount of $75,000,000 and a revolving credit facility in the
aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000.

The new Credit Agreement permits the Company to choose between various
interest rate options and to specify the portion of the borrowing to be covered
by specific interest rate options. Under the Revolving Credit Agreement and
Bridge Loan, the interest rate options available to the Company are: (a) U.S.
prime rate plus the applicable margin (ranging from 0% to 3/4 of 1%) or (b)
LIBOR plus the applicable margin (ranging from 1/2 of 1% to 2%). The
applicable margin is adjusted based upon the Funded Indebtedness to Cash Flow
Ratio of Cambrex Corporation. The Term Loan will have the same options plus
1/2%. Additionally, the Company pays a commitment fee of between 1/5 of 1% to
3/8 of 1% on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit facilities.

On October 11, 1994, $32,200,000 from the new Loan Agreement was used
to satisfy the prior Credit Agreement.

ARTICLE II
THE COMMITMENTS AND THE ADVANCES
--------------------------------

2.1 Commitments of the Banks.
------------------------

(a) Revolving Credit Advances. Each Bank
agrees, for itself only, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
to make Revolving Credit Loans to the Company pursuant to Section 2.4 and
Section 3.3 and to participate in Letter of Credit Advances to the Company
pursuant to Section 2.4, from time to time from and including the Effective
Date to but excluding the Termination Date, not to exceed in aggregate
principal amount the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment, provided that
the aggregate Letter of Credit Advances outstanding at any time may not exceed
15% of the aggregate amount of all Revolving Credit Commitments.

(b) Term Loan A. Each Bank further agrees, for
itself only, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make a
portion of Term Loan A to the Company on or before the closing date of the
Acquisition in an amount equal to its Term Loan A Commitment.

(c) Term Loan B. Each Bank further agrees, for
itself only, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make a
portion of Term Loan B to the Company consisting of (i) its pro rata share
based on its Term Loan B Commitment of a draw under Term Loan B on the
Effective Date in an aggregate amount equal to $17,000,000 for the purpose of
refinancing all indebtedness under the term loan outstanding under the Existing
Loan Agreement and (ii) its pro rata share based on its Term Loan B Commitment
of a draw on or before the closing date of the Acquisition, in an amount not to
exceed the remaining amount of its Term Loan B Commitment.

(d) Swing Line Loan. (i) The Company may
request the Agent to make, and the Agent may, in its sole discretion provided
that the requirements of Section 2.6 are complied with by the Company with
respect to such request, make, Swing Line Loans to the Company from time to
time on any Business Day (but limited to one such Advance per Business Day)
during the period from the Effective Date until the Termination Date in an
aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any date the lesser of (A)
$2,500,000 (the "Swing Line Facility") and (B) the aggregate of the unused
portions of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Banks as of such date.
Each Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment shall be deemed utilized by an amount
equal to such Bank's pro rata share (based on such Bank's Revolving Credit
Commitment) of each Swing Line Loan for purposes of determining the amount of
Revolving

-16-
<PAGE> 17
Credit Advances required to be made by such Bank, but shall not be deemed
utilized for purposes of determining commitment fees under Section 2.3(a).
Within the limits of the Swing Line Facility, so long as the Agent, in its sole
discretion, elects to make Swing Line Loans, the Company may borrow and
reborrow under this Section 2.1(d)(i).

(ii) The Agent may at any time in its
sole and absolute discretion require that any Swing Line Loan be refunded by a
Revolving Credit Loan which is a Floating Rate Loan, and upon notice thereof by
the Agent to the Company and the Banks, the Company shall be deemed to have
requested a Revolving Credit Loan bearing interest at the Floating Rate in an
amount equal to the amount of any such Swing Line Loan, and such Revolving
Credit Loan shall be made to refund such Swing Line Loan. Each Bank shall be
absolutely and unconditionally obligated (except as set forth in Section
2.1(d)(i)) to fund its pro rata share (based on such Bank's Revolving Credit
Commitment) of such Revolving Credit Loan and such obligation shall not be
affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Bank or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries may have against the Agent, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or anyone else for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence
or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in
the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other Bank; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or
event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing (including the
Company's failure to satisfy any conditions contained in Article II or any
other provision of this Agreement).

(e) Supplementary Loans. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Agent, the Company and
the Banks acknowledges and agrees that each of the Banks shall independently
have the ability to make Supplementary Loans to the Company. With respect to
such Supplementary Loans: (i) the Supplementary Loans (A) shall be made
pursuant to agreements between the Company and each Bank making Supplementary
Loans, (B) shall bear interest and fees as provided in such agreements for the
sole account of the Bank making such Supplementary Loans, (C) shall not be
considered Advances under this Agreement and shall not be subject to terms and
provisions of this Agreement regarding Advances and (D) shall be considered
Indebtedness permitted under and subject to the limitation set forth in Section
5.2(f)(vii); (ii) the Company agrees to deliver immediate notice to the Agent
of the making of each Supplementary Loan and each payment thereon and (iii)
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit
Advances outstanding under this Agreement shall be adjusted on the first
Business Day of each month based upon the Supplementary Loans and the Revolving
Credit Advances outstanding on the last Business Day of the preceding month
such that the ratio of each Bank's aggregate amount of Revolving Credit
Advances and Supplementary Loans to the sum of the total amount of Revolving
Credit Advances outstanding hereunder plus the total amount of the
Supplementary Loans is equal to each Bank's Percentage of Total Revolving
Credit Commitments and, for purposes of such adjustment, the Supplementary
Loans shall be deemed usage of the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Bank
making such Supplementary Loan in an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of Supplementary Loans made to the Company by such Bank;
provided, however, if at any time the

-17-
<PAGE> 18
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Supplementary Loans by the Banks
exceeds 10% of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment of all Banks, the Company
must request a Revolving Credit Loan, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, to refinance all outstanding Supplementary Loans. The total
amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances plus the total amount of
outstanding Supplementary Loans shall at no time exceed the Total Revolving
Credit Commitments.

2.2 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The
Company shall have the right to terminate in whole or reduce in part any or all
of the Commitments at any time and from time to time, provided that (i) the
Company shall give prior notice of such termination or reduction to the Agent
specifying the amount and effective date thereof, and to which Commitment such
termination or reduction is applicable, (ii) each partial reduction of any such
Commitment shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and shall reduce the Commitments of all of the Banks
proportionately, (iii) no such termination or reduction shall be permitted with
respect to any portion of the Commitments as to which a request for an Advance
pursuant to Section 2.4 is then pending, and (iv) any such Commitment may not
be terminated if any Advances are then outstanding and may not be reduced below
the principal amount of Advances then outstanding under such Commitment. The
Commitments or any portion thereof terminated or reduced pursuant to this
Section 2.2, whether optional or mandatory, may not be reinstated.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a Letter of
Credit Advance (i) shall be deemed outstanding in an amount equal to the sum of

or after the date of determination and on or before the stated expiry date
thereof plus the amount of any draws under such Letter of Credit that have not
been reimbursed as provided in Section 3.3 and (ii) shall be deemed outstanding
at all times on and before such stated expiry date or such earlier date on
which all amounts available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit have been
fully drawn, and thereafter until all related reimbursement obligations have
been paid pursuant to Section 3.3. As provided in Section 3.3, upon each
payment made by the Agent in respect of any draft or other demand for payment
under any Letter of Credit, the amount of any Letter of Credit Advance
outstanding immediately prior to such payment shall be automatically reduced by
the amount of each Revolving Credit Loan deemed advanced in respect of the
related reimbursement obligation of the Company.

(c) In the event the Acquisition is not
consummated on or before December 15, 1994, (i) the Term Loan A Commitment of
each Bank shall automatically and immediately terminate, (ii) the aggregate
principal amount of Term Loan B Commitments of the Banks shall be permanently

accordingly, and (iii) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments of all of the Banks shall be permanently reduced to $45,000,000,
except to the extent otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 8.14; which
reductions shall reduce the Term Loan B Commitments and the Revolving Credit
Commitments of all of the Banks proportionately.

stated expiry date of such S/L/C, which fee shall be paid annually in advance
at the time such S/L/C is issued, and (B) an additional fee to the Agent for
its own account computed at the rate of one-quarter of one percent (1/4 of 1%)
per annum of such maximum amount for such period, and (ii) with respect to
C/L/Cs, (A) a fee to the Banks computed at the rate of one-quarter of one

upon the amount of such C/L/C which is presented or drawn upon, in whole or in
part, and if any C/L/C or portion thereof is not drawn upon, the Company shall
pay an expiry fee to the Banks in the amount of $50 per C/L/C and (B) an
additional fee to the Agent for its own account computed at the rate of
one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) per annum, which fee shall be computed on
the amount and paid on the date described in clause (ii)(A) above. Such fees
are nonrefundable and the Company shall not be entitled to any rebate of any
portion thereof if such Letter of Credit does not remain outstanding through
its stated expiry date or for any other reason. The Company further agrees to
pay to the Agent, on demand, such other customary administrative fees, charges
and expenses of the Agent in respect of the issuance, negotiation, acceptance,

1%) on the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment, which extension fee shall
be payable fifty percent (50%) upon the execution of the extension agreement
and the remaining fifty percent (50%) on the first anniversary of the execution
of such extension agreement.

2.4 Disbursement of Advances. (a)(i) Except with respect
to Swing Line Loans, the Company shall give the Agent notice of its request for
each Advance in substantially the form of Exhibit J hereto not later than 10:00
a.m. Detroit time (A) four Eurocurrency Business Days prior to the date such
Advance is requested to be made if such Advance is to be made as a Eurocurrency
Rate Borrowing, (B) five Business Days prior to the date any Letter of Credit
Advance is requested to be made, (C) on the Business Day such Advance is
requested to be made in all other cases, which notice shall specify whether a
Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing, a Floating Rate Borrowing, or a Letter of Credit
Advance is requested and, in the case of each requested Eurocurrency Rate
Borrowing, the Eurocurrency Interest Period to be initially applicable to such
Borrowing, and the Permitted Currency in which such Loan is requested to be
denominated and, in the case of each Letter of Credit Advance, such information
as may be necessary for the issuance thereof by the Agent. The Agent, not
later than 1:00 p.m. Detroit time the Business Day such notice of a Floating
Rate Borrowing (other than a Swing Line Loan) is given, and not later than the
Business Day next succeeding the day such notice is given in all other cases,
shall provide notice of such requested Advance to each Bank.

(ii) With respect to Swing Line Loans, the Company
shall give the Agent notice of its request for each Swing Line Loan in
substantially the form of Exhibit J hereto not later than 2:30 p.m. Detroit
time on the same Business Day any Swing Line Loan is requested to be made. The
Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m. Detroit time the Business Day next succeeding
the day such notice of a Swing Line Loan is given, shall provide notice of each
Swing Line Loan to each Bank in the event such Swing Line Loan is not paid in
full by the Company prior to the time such notice is given.

(iii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the proceeds of each such requested Advance shall be made available
to the Company by depositing the proceeds thereof, in the case of any Advance
denominated in Dollars, in immediately available funds, in an account
maintained and designated by the Company at the principal office of the Agent
and, in all other cases, in an account maintained and designated by the Company
at a bank acceptable to the Agent in the principal financial center of the
country issuing the Permitted Currency in which such Loan is denominated or in
such other reasonable place specified by the Agent. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Agent shall, on the date any Letter of Credit
Advance is requested to be made, issue the related Letter of Credit on behalf
of

-20-
<PAGE> 21
the Banks for the account of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Agent may decline to issue any requested Letter of Credit on
the basis that the beneficiary, the purpose of issuance or the terms or the
conditions of drawing are unacceptable to it in its discretion.

(b) Each Bank, on the date any Borrowing in the
form of a Loan (other than a Swing Line Loan) is required to be made, shall
make its pro rata share of such Borrowing available in immediately available,
freely transferable, cleared funds for disbursement to the Company pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the case of any Borrowing
denominated in Dollars, at the principal office of the Agent and, in all other
cases, to the account of the Agent at its designated branch or correspondent
bank in the country issuing the Permitted Currency in which such Borrowing is
denominated or in such other reasonable place specified by the Agent. Unless
the Agent shall have received notice from any Bank prior to the date such
Borrowing is requested to be made under this Section 2.4 that such Bank will
not make available to the Agent such Bank's pro rata portion of such Borrowing,
the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the
Agent on the date such Borrowing is requested to be made in accordance with
this Section 2.4. If and to the extent such Bank shall not have so made such
pro rata portion available to the Agent, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) make such amount available to the Company, and such Bank and the
Company severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Company by the Agent until the date such amount is repaid to
the Agent, at (i) the rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to
such Borrowing during such period in the case of the Company and (ii) the rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate during such period in the case of any
Bank. If such Bank shall pay such amount to the Agent together with interest,
such amount so paid shall constitute a Loan by such Bank as a part of such
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. The failure of any Bank to make its
pro rata portion of any such Borrowing available to the Agent shall not relieve
any other Bank of its obligations to make available its pro rata portion of
such Borrowing on the date such Borrowing is requested to be made, but no Bank
shall be responsible for failure of any other Bank to make such pro rata
portion available to the Agent on the date of any such Borrowing.

(c) All Revolving Credit Loans made under this
Section 2.4 shall be evidenced by the Revolving Credit Notes and the Term
Loans made under this Section 2.4 shall be evidenced by the Term Notes, and
all such Loans shall be due and payable and bear interest as provided in
Article III. Each Bank is hereby authorized by the Company to record on the
schedule attached to the Notes, or in its books and records, the date, and
amount and type of each Loan and the duration of the related Eurocurrency
Interest Period (if applicable), the amount of each payment or prepayment of
principal thereon, and the other information provided for on such schedule,
which schedule or books and records, as the case may be, shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the information so recorded, provided, however, that failure
of any Bank to record, or any error in recording, any such information shall
not relieve the Company of its obligation to repay the outstanding principal
amount of the Loans, all accrued interest thereon and other amounts payable
with respect thereto in accordance with the terms of the Notes and this
Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
may borrow

-21-
<PAGE> 22
Revolving Credit Loans under this Section 2.4 and under Section 3.3, prepay
Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 3.1 and reborrow Revolving Credit
Loans but not Term Loans under this Section 2.4.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
to require or authorize any Bank to issue any Letter of Credit, it being
recognized that the Agent has the sole obligation under this Agreement to issue
Letters of Credit on behalf of the Banks, and the Revolving Credit Commitment
of each Bank with respect to Letter of Credit Advances is expressly conditioned
upon the Agent's performance of such obligations. Upon such issuance by the
Agent, each Bank shall automatically acquire a pro rata risk participation
interest in such Letter of Credit Advance based on its respective Revolving
Credit Commitment. If the Agent shall honor a draft or other demand for
payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, the Agent shall provide
notice thereof to each Bank on the date such draft or demand is honored unless
the Company shall have satisfied its reimbursement obligation under Section 3.3
by payment to the Agent on such date. Each Bank, on such date, shall make its
pro rata share of the amount paid by the Agent available in immediately
available funds at the principal office of the Agent for the account of the
Agent. If and to the extent such Bank shall not have made any required pro
rata portion available to the Agent, such Bank and the Company severally agree
to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount was paid by the Agent until
such amount is so made available to the Agent at (i) the per annum rate equal
to the interest rate applicable during such period to the related Loan
disbursed under Section 3.3 in respect of the reimbursement obligation of the
Company in the case of the Company and (ii) the rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate during such period in the case of any Bank. If such Bank
shall pay such amount to the Agent together with such interest, such amount so
paid shall constitute a Revolving Credit Loan by such Bank as part of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing disbursed in respect of the reimbursement obligation
of the Company under Section 3.3 for purposes of this Agreement. The failure
of any Bank to make its pro rata portion of any such amount paid by the Agent
available to the Agent shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to
make available its pro rata portion of such amount, but no Bank shall be
responsible for failure of any other Bank to make such pro rata portion
available to the Agent.

(e) The Banks agree that the then existing
Termination Date shall automatically be extended for a period of two years
beyond the then existing Termination Date on the second anniversary of the
Effective Date (i.e., October 11, 1996) and on such date every two years
thereafter (i.e., October 11, 1998, October 11, 2000, etc.). As an example of
the foregoing, the Termination Date shall be extended on October 11, 1996 to
October 11, 1999 and the Termination Date shall be further extended on October
11, 1998 to October 11, 2001. Such extension shall be automatic unless either
(i) the Company delivers notice in writing to the Agent of its election not to
extend the Termination Date 150 days prior to the date such extension is to be
effective or (ii) the Banks fail to deliver notice of their agreement to extend
the Termination Date to the Company 120 days prior to the date such extension
is to be effective. Each of the Banks agrees to provide notice in writing to
the Agent of its agreement or refusal to extend such Termination Date 120 days
prior to the date such extension is to be effective; provided, however, that
the failure of any Bank to so communicate its agreement or refusal shall be
deemed to be

-22-
<PAGE> 23
such Bank's refusal to so extend the Termination Date. The determination to
extend or not to extend the Termination Date shall be given or withheld by each
Bank in its absolute and sole discretion and any such agreement or refusal once
given shall not be revocable by any Bank prior to the then applicable
Termination Date. No extension of the Termination Date shall in any event be
effective until the Agent shall have received agreements to so extend from each
of the Banks; provided, however, that if any Bank refuses to extend the
Termination Date, the Agent shall provide notice to the consenting Banks of
such refusal and each of the consenting Banks shall have five Business Days to
either revoke or confirm its decision to extend the Termination Date and, in
the event that any or all of the consenting Banks confirm their respective
decisions to extend (i) the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Bank shall
remain unchanged and the Total Commitment and the Percentage of Total
Commitments shall be modified accordingly or (ii) additional lenders shall be
added to the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.14, provided, that, each of the
consenting Banks shall have the right of first refusal to accept a pro rata
increase in any refusing Bank's Commitments before any additional lender is
added hereto.

Agent acknowledge and agree that the Security Agreement and the financing
statements executed and delivered to the Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(e) shall
be held in escrow by the Agent until the occurrence of a Collateral Event.
Upon the occurrence of a Collateral Event, the Security Agreement and all
financing statements shall be automatically and immediately released from
escrow and security interest granted thereunder shall become automatically and
immediately effective in order to grant to the Agent for the benefit of the
Banks to secure all present and future indebtedness, obligations and
liabilities of the Company and each Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement, the
Notes and the Security Documents a perfected and enforceable first lien and
security interest in all present and future accounts, documents, instruments,
general intangibles, chattel paper, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment,

Company and the Guarantors, whether now existing or hereafter arising. Upon
the occurrence of a Collateral Event, the Agent shall immediately file all
financing statements held in escrow by the Agent and the Company and the
Guarantors agree to execute any additional financing statements, each in form
and substance satisfactory to the Agent and the Required Banks, as may be
requested by the Agent and the Required Banks (the Security Agreement, together
with all such financing

-27-
<PAGE> 28
statements hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Additional Security
Documents"). Upon release from escrow of such Additional Security Documents,
all such Additional Security Documents shall be deemed "Security Documents" for
purposes of this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the
Company agrees it shall furnish to the Banks and the Agent, not later than 30
calendar days after and as of the end of each month, a Borrowing Base
Certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit L describing in reasonable
detail the amount of Eligible Accounts Receivable, Eligible Inventory and Fixed
Assets as of the end of such month, certified as correct by the chief financial
officer of the Company, together with schedules of accounts receivable and
inventory of the Company and the Guarantors as of the end of such month
indicating the total of accounts receivable by type, by terms, and by age,
describing any returns, defenses, setoffs or pertinent information in

amounts, locations and values of the type of inventory. The Company and the
Guarantors also agree to make any amendments which may be necessary to this
Agreement or any Security Document in connection with the execution and
delivery of the Additional Security Documents.

The Company and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably appoint the
Agent to act as, and the Agent shall have the right to act as, the Company's
lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, in the name of the
Company and the Guarantors, or any of them, to execute the Additional Security
Documents and to take generally any action in connection with the Additional
Security Documents, including, without limitation, the filing of any financing
statements and other documents in order to perfect the security interests of
the Banks; provided, however, that the Agent shall not exercise its rights as
attorney-in-fact unless and until a Collateral Event occurs and the Company and
the Guarantors have failed to execute and deliver the Additional Security
Documents within 5 calendar days after demand by the Agent.

2.12 Borrowing Base. Upon the occurrence of a Trigger
Event, the aggregate outstanding amount of Revolving Credit Advances plus the
aggregate outstanding amount of Supplementary Loans shall not at any time
thereafter exceed the Borrowing Base. If such Revolving Credit Advances plus
such Supplementary Loans shall exceed the Borrowing Base, the Company shall
forthwith pay to the Banks an amount not less than the amount of such excess
for application to the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit
Loans, provided that if any such prepayment would be in excess of the
outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, the Company shall deliver
cash collateral to the Agent to secure the outstanding Letters of Credit in the
amount of such excess which is greater than the outstanding Revolving Credit
Loans and the Company hereby grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks,
a first priority lien and security interest in such collateral, and all such
cash collateral shall be under the sole and exclusive control of the Agent, for
the benefit of the Banks.

ARTICLE III
PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS OF ADVANCES
------------------------------------

3.1 Principal Payments.
------------------

(a) Unless earlier payment is required under this
Agreement (i) the Company shall pay to the Banks on the Termination Date the
entire outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, (ii) the
Company shall pay to the Banks the outstanding principal amount of the Term
Loan A on Maturity Date A and (iii) the Company shall pay to the Banks the
outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan B in twelve equal quarterly

installments in the amount of $3,937,500, payable on the last Business Day of
each March, June, September and December commencing on the first such Business
Day after the Effective Date, to and including the Maturity Date B, when the
entire outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan B shall be due and
payable. Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Agreement, the
Company may request a Revolving Credit Loan for the purpose of repaying the
Term Loan A if, after the disbursement of a Revolving Credit Loan for such
purpose, the ratio of Funded Indebtedness to Cash Flow would be less than 3.0
to 1.0, as calculated in the manner set forth in Section 5.2(b).

(b) The Company may at any time and from time to
time prepay all or a portion of the Loans, without premium or penalty, provided
that (i) the Company may not prepay any portion of any Loan as to which an
election of or a conversion to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan is pending pursuant to
2.7, (ii) unless earlier payment is required under this Agreement, any
Eurocurrency Rate Loan may only be prepaid on the last day of the then current
Eurocurrency Interest Period with respect to such Loan, and (iii) such
prepayment shall only be permitted if the Company shall have given not less
than one days' notice thereof in the case of prepayment of any Floating Rate
Loan and ten days' notice thereof for all other Loans, in each case such notice
specifying the Loan or portion thereof to be so prepaid and shall have paid to
the Banks, together with such prepayment of principal, all accrued interest to
the date of payment on such Loan or portion thereof so prepaid and all amounts
owing to the Banks under Section 3.9 in connection with such prepayment. Upon
the giving of such notice, the aggregate principal amount of such Loan or
portion thereof so specified in such notice, together with such accrued
interest and other amounts, shall become due and payable on the specified
prepayment date.

(c) In addition to all other payments of the Term
Loans required hereunder, the Company shall prepay the Term Loan A by an amount
equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of any equity offering and/or debt
offering.

(d) All prepayments of the Term Loans, whether
optional or mandatory, shall first be applied to principal of Term Loan A
until paid in full, and thereafter, to Term Loan B, to be applied to scheduled
installments of Term Loan B in the inverse order of their maturities until paid
in full. No partial prepayment of either Term Loan shall reduce the amount or
defer the date of the scheduled installments of principal required to be paid
thereon.

<PAGE> 30
(e) If, pursuant to Section 2.7, a Borrowing, or
portion thereof, is continued or converted, such Borrowing or portion thereof
shall be repaid on the last day of the related Interest Period in the Permitted
Currency in which such Borrowing is then denominated and (i) in the case of any
conversion, the Agent shall readvance to the Company the Equivalent of the
Original Dollar Amount of the Borrowing or portion thereof as has been so
repaid by the Company in the Permitted Currency requested pursuant to Section
2.7, and (ii) in the case of any continuation, the Agent shall readvance to the
Company the same amount of such Permitted Currency as has been so repaid. For
purposes of effecting the repayment required by this Section 3.1(e), the Agent
shall apply the proceeds of such readvance toward the repayment of such
Borrowing or portion thereof on the last day of the related Interest Period.
In the case of any conversion, the Agent shall be deemed to have applied the
proceeds of such advance toward the purchase of the Permitted Currency to be
repaid and to have applied the proceeds of such purchase toward such repayment.
If after any such application there shall remain owing an amount of the
Permitted Currency due to the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, or if an
excess of such Permitted Currency shall result, the Company shall pay to the
Banks, or the Banks shall pay to the Company, as the case may be, the amount of
such deficiency or such excess. In the case of any continuation, on the last
day of such Interest Period, the Original Dollar Amount of such Borrowing or
portion thereof shall be adjusted to the amount in Dollars resulting from the
conversion of the amount of such Permitted Currency so readvanced to Dollars
determined as of the second Business Day preceding such day. If, after such
adjustment of the Original Dollar Amount of such Borrowing or portion thereof,
the Original Dollar Amount of all Advances then outstanding under this
Agreement would exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Banks,
the Company shall repay to the Banks on the last day of such related Interest
Period an amount in the Permitted Currency in which such Borrowing is
denominated equal to the amount of such excess or in full if such excess
exceeds the amount of such Borrowing, together with all amounts owing to the
Banks under Section 3.9 in connection therewith.

3.2 Interest Payments. The Company shall pay interest to
the Banks on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan, for the period
commencing on the date such Loan is made until such Loan is paid in full, on
each Interest Payment Date and at maturity (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), and thereafter on demand, at the following rates
per annum:

(a) During such periods that such Loan is a
Floating Rate Loan, the Floating Rate.

(b) During such periods that such Loan is a
Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Eurocurrency Rate applicable to such Loan for each
related Eurocurrency Interest Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b), the Company shall pay
interest on demand at the Overdue Rate on the outstanding principal amount of
any Loan and any other amount payable by the Company hereunder (other than
interest) which is not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) for the period commencing on the due date thereof
until the same is paid in full.

3.3 Letter of Credit Reimbursement Payments. (a) (i) The
Company agrees to pay to the Agent, on the day on which the Agent shall honor a
draft or other demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit,
an amount equal to the amount paid by the Agent in respect of such draft or
other demand under such Letter of Credit and all expenses paid or incurred by
the Agent relative thereto. Unless the Company shall have made such payment to
the Banks on such day, upon each such payment by the Agent, the Agent shall be
deemed to have disbursed to the Company, and the Company shall be deemed to
have elected to satisfy its reimbursement obligation by, a Revolving Credit
Loan bearing interest at the Floating Rate for the account of the Banks in an
amount equal to the amount so paid by the Agent in respect of such draft or
other demand under such Letter of Credit. Such Revolving Credit Loan shall be
disbursed and, to the extent of the Revolving Credit Loan so disbursed, the
reimbursement obligation of the Company under this Section 3.3 shall be deemed
satisfied.

(ii) If for any reason (including without
limitation as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6.1(h)), Floating
Rate Loans may not be made by the Banks as described in Section 3.3(a)(i), then
(A) the Company agrees that each reimbursement amount not paid pursuant to the
first sentence of Section 3.3(a)(i) shall bear interest, payable on demand by
the Agent, at the Overdue Rate, and (B) effective on the date each such
Floating Rate Loan would otherwise have been made, each Bank severally agrees
that it shall unconditionally and irrevocably, without regard to the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default, in lieu of a deemed disbursement of
Revolving Credit Loans, to the extent of such Bank's Revolving Credit
Commitment, purchase a participating interest in each reimbursement amount.
Each Bank will immediately transfer to the Agent, in same day funds, the amount
of its participation. Each Bank shall share on a pro rata basis (calculated by
reference to the Revolving Credit Commitments) in any interest which accrues
thereon and in all repayments thereof. If and to the extent that any Bank
shall not have so made the amount of such participating interest available to
the Agent, such Bank and the Company agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
of demand by the Agent until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at (x)
in the case of the Company, the Overdue Rate and (y) in the case of such Bank,
the Federal Funds Rate.

(b) The reimbursement obligation of the Company
under this Section 3.3 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and
shall remain in full force and effect until all obligations of the Company to
the Banks hereunder shall have been satisfied, and such obligations of the
Company shall not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening of any
event, including without limitation, any of the following, whether or not with
notice to, or the consent of, the Company:

(i) Any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any documentation relating to any
Letter of Credit or to any transaction related in any way to such Letter of
Credit (the "Letter of Credit Documents");

-31-
<PAGE> 32
(ii) Any amendment, modification, waiver,
consent, or any substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any
interest in collateral or security, with respect to any of the Letter of Credit
Documents;

(iii) The existence of any claim, setoff,
defense or other right which the Company may have at any time against any
beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any persons or
entities for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting),
the Agent or any Bank or any other person or entity, whether in connection with
any of the Letter of Credit Documents, the transactions contemplated herein or
therein or any unrelated transactions;

(iv) Any draft or other statement or
document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect;

(v) Payment by the Agent to the
beneficiary under any Letter of Credit against presentation of documents which
do not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit, including failure of any
documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit;

(vi) Any failure, omission, delay or lack
on the part of the Agent or any Bank or any party to any of the Letter of
Credit Documents to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy
conferred upon the Agent, any Bank or any such party under this Agreement or
any of the Letter of Credit Documents, or any other acts or omissions on the
part of the Agent, any Bank or any such party; or

(vii) Any other event or circumstance that
would, in the absence of this clause, result in the release or discharge by
operation of law or otherwise of the Company from the performance or observance
of any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Section 3.3.

No setoff, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation or any
defense of any kind or nature which the Company has or may have against the
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit shall be available hereunder to the Company
against the Agent or any Bank. Nothing in this Section 3.3 shall limit the
liability, if any, of the Company to the Banks pursuant to Section 8.5.

3.4 Payment Method. (a) All payments to be made by the
Company hereunder will be made to the Agent for the account of the Banks (i) in
the case of principal and interest on any Loan, in the Permitted Currency in
which such Loan is denominated, and (ii) in all other cases, in the otherwise
specified or relevant currency, and in all cases in immediately available,
freely transferable, cleared funds not later than 1:00 p.m. at the place for
payment on the date on which such payment shall be come due (x) in the case of
principal and interest on any Loan denominated in a Permitted Currency other
than Dollars, by credit to the account of the Agent at its designated branch or
correspondent bank in the country issuing the relevant Permitted

-32-
<PAGE> 33
Currency or in such other place specified by the Agent with respect to such
Loan pursuant to Section 2.4(b), and (y) in all other cases to the Agent at the
address of its principal office specified in Section 8.2. Payments received
after 1:00 p.m. at the place for payment shall be deemed to be payments made
prior to 1:00 p.m. at the place for payment on the next succeeding Business
Day. The Company hereby authorizes the Agent to charge its account with the
Agent in order to cause timely payment of amounts due hereunder to be made
(subject to sufficient funds being available in such account for that purpose).

(b) At the time of making each such payment, the
Company shall, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
specify to the Agent that Loan or other obligation of the Company hereunder to
which such payment is to be applied. In the event that the Company fails to so
specify the relevant obligation or if an Event of Default or Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Agent may apply such payments as it may
determine in its sole discretion.

(c) On the day such payments are deemed received,
the Agent shall remit to the Banks their pro rata shares of such payments in
immediately available same day funds, (i) in the case of payments of principal
and interest on any Borrowing denominated in a Permitted Currency other than
Dollars, at an account maintained and designated by each Bank at a bank in the
principal financial center of the country issuing the Permitted Currency in
which such Borrowing is denominated or in such other reasonable place specified
by such Bank and (ii) in all other cases, to the Banks at their respective
address in the United States specified for notices pursuant to Section 8.2. In
the case of payments of principal and interest on any Borrowing, such pro rata
shares shall be determined with respect to each such Bank by the ratio which
the outstanding principal balance of its Loan included in such Borrowing bears
to the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of all the Banks included in
such Borrowing and in the case of fees paid pursuant to Section 2.3 and other
amounts payable hereunder (other than the Agent's fees payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(d) and amounts payable to any Bank under Section 2.4 or 3.7), such
pro rata shares shall be determined with respect to each such Bank by the ratio
which the Commitment of such Bank bears to the Commitments of all the Banks.

(d) This Agreement arises in the context of an
international transaction, and the specification of payment in a specific
currency at a specific place pursuant to this Agreement is of the essence.
Such specified currency shall be the currency of account and payment under this
Agreement. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be discharged by
an amount paid in any other currency or at another place, whether pursuant to a
judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid, on prompt
conversion into the applicable currency and transfer to the Banks under normal
banking procedure, does not yield the amount of such currency due under this
Agreement. In the event that any payment, whether pursuant to a judgment or
otherwise, upon conversion and transfer, does not result in payment of the
amount of such currency due under this Agreement, the Banks shall have an
independent cause of action against the Company for the currency deficit.

-33-
<PAGE> 34
(e) If for purposes of obtaining judgment in any
court it becomes necessary to convert any currency due hereunder into any other
currency, the Company will pay such additional amount, if any, as may be
necessary to ensure that the amount paid in respect of such judgment is the
amount in such other currency which when converted at the Agent's spot rate of
exchange prevailing on the date of payment would yield the same amount of the
currency due hereunder. Any amount due from the Company under this Section
3.4(e) will be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by judgment
being obtained for any other sum due under or in respect of this Agreement.

3.5 No Setoff or Deduction. All payments of principal
and interest on the Loans and other amounts payable by the Company hereunder
shall be made by the Company without setoff or counterclaim, and free and clear
of, and without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments, or other charges of
whatever nature, imposed by any governmental authority, or by any department,
agency or other political subdivision or taxing authority.

3.6 Payment on Non-Business Day; Payment Computations.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever any
installment of principal of, or interest on, any Loan or any other amount due
hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the
maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in
the case of any installment of principal, interest shall be payable thereon at
the rate per annum determined in accordance with this Agreement during such
extension. Computations of interest and other amounts due under this Agreement
shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days
elapsed, including the first day but excluding the last day of the relevant
period.

3.7 Additional Costs. (a) In the event that any
applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or
hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to any Bank or the
Agent, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank or the Agent with any guideline, request or directive of
any such authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall (i) affect
the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank or the Agent of any amounts
payable by the Company under this Agreement (other than taxes imposed on the
overall net income of the Bank or the Agent, by the jurisdiction, or by any
political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction, in which
any Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, has its principal office), or (ii)
shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by any Bank or the Agent, or (iii) shall impose any other condition
with respect to this Agreement, the Commitments, the Notes or the Loans or any
Letter of Credit, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the
cost to any Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, of making, funding or
maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or any Letter of Credit or to reduce the
amount of any sum receivable by any Bank or the Agent, as the case may be,
thereon, then the Company shall pay to such Bank or the Agent, as the case may
be, from time to time, upon request by such Bank (with a copy of such request
to be provided to the Agent)

-34-
<PAGE> 35

or the Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank or the
Agent, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduced sum receivable to
the extent, in the case of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, such Bank or the Agent
is not compensated therefor in the computation of the interest rate applicable
to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan. A statement as to the amount of such increased
cost or reduced sum receivable, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail
by such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, and submitted by such Bank or
the Agent, as the case may be, to the Company, shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.

(b) In the event that any applicable law, treaty,
rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and
whether or not presently applicable to any Bank or the Agent, or any
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank or
the Agent with any guideline, request or directive of any such authority
(whether or not having the force of law), including any risk-based capital
guidelines, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by such Bank or the Agent (or any corporation controlling such
Bank or the Agent) and such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, determines
that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of
such Bank's or the Agent's obligations hereunder and such increase has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or the Agent's (or such
controlling corporation's) capital as a consequence of such obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Bank or the Agent (or such
controlling corporation) could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking
into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by such Bank or the Agent to be material, then the Company shall pay to
such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, from time to time, upon request by
such Bank (with a copy of such request to be provided to the Agent) or the
Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank or the Agent (or
such controlling corporation) for any increase in the amount of capital and
reduced rate of return which such Bank or the Agent reasonably determines to be
allocable to the existence of such Bank's or the Agent's obligations hereunder.
A statement as to the amount of such compensation, prepared in good faith and
in reasonable detail by such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, and
submitted by such Bank or the Agent to the Company, shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.

3.8 Illegality and Impossibility. In the event that any
applicable law, treaty or other international agreement, rule or regulation
(whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not
presently applicable to any Bank, or any interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with any guideline, request
or directive of such authority (whether or not having the force of law),
including without limitation exchange controls, (a) shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Bank to maintain any Eurocurrency Rate Loan under this
Agreement or (b) shall make it impracticable, unlawful or impossible for, or
shall in any way limit or impair the ability of, the Company to make or any
Bank to receive any payment under this Agreement at the place specified for
payment hereunder or to freely convert any amount paid into Dollars at market
rates of exchange or to transfer any amount paid

-35-
<PAGE> 36
or so converted to the address of its principal office specified in Section
8.2, the Company shall upon receipt of notice thereof from such Bank, repay in
full the then outstanding principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan so
affected, together with all accrued interest thereon to the date of payment and
all amounts owing to such Bank under Section 3.9, (i) on the last day of the
then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan if such
Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loan to such day,
or (ii) immediately if such Bank may not continue to maintain such Eurocurrency
Rate Loan to such day.

3.9 Indemnification. If the Company makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loan on any other date than the
last day of a Eurocurrency Interest Period applicable thereto (whether pursuant
to Section 3.8, Section 6.2 or otherwise), or if the Company fails to borrow
any Eurocurrency Rate Loan after notice has been given to the Banks in
accordance with Section 2.4, or if the Company fails to make any payment of
principal or interest in respect of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan when due, the
Company shall reimburse each Bank on demand for any resulting loss or expense
incurred by each such Bank, including without limitation any loss incurred in
obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, whether or not
such Bank shall have funded or committed to fund such Loan. A statement as to
the amount of such loss or expense, prepared in good faith and in reasonable
detail by such Bank and submitted by such Bank to the Company, shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.
Calculation of all amounts payable to such Bank under this Section 3.9 shall be
made as though such Bank shall have actually funded or committed to fund the
relevant Eurocurrency Rate Loan through the purchase of an underlying deposit
in an amount equal to the amount of such Loan and having a maturity comparable
to the related Interest Period and, in the case of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan,
through the transfer of such deposit from an offshore office of such Bank to a
domestic office of such Bank in the United States of America; provided,
however, that such Bank may fund any Eurocurrency Rate Loan in any manner it
sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the purpose of
calculation of amounts payable under this Section 3.9.

3.10 Substitution of Banks. (a) Each Bank agrees that, as
promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or
the existence of a condition that (i) would cause it to incur any increased
costs or inability to perform its agreements under Section 2.8, 3.7 or 3.8, or
(ii) would require the Company to pay an increased amount under Section 2.8,
3.7 or 3.8, it will promptly notify the Agent, who shall notify the Company, of
such event or condition and, to the extent not inconsistent with such Bank's
internal policies, will use its reasonable efforts to make, fund or maintain
the affected Loans of such Bank through another lending office of such Bank if
as a result thereof the additional monies which would otherwise be required to
be paid or the reduction of amounts receivable by such Bank thereunder in
respect of such Loans would be materially reduced, or such inability to perform
would cease to exist, or the increased costs which would otherwise be required
to be paid in respect of such Loans pursuant to Section 2.8 or 3.7 would be
materially reduced or the taxes or other amounts otherwise payable under
Section 2.8 or 3.7 would be materially reduced, and if, as determined by such
Bank, in its sole discretion, the making, funding or maintaining of such Loans
through

-36-
<PAGE> 37
such other lending office would not otherwise materially adversely affect such
Loans or such Bank.

(b) In the event any Bank shall have delivered to
the Company a notice pursuant to Section 3.10(a) above, that a Eurocurrency
Rate Loan is no longer available from such Bank pursuant to Section 3.8 or that
any of the events designated in Section 3.10(a) above have occurred or shall
have failed to make its share of a Loan available in accordance with Section
2.4(b), the Company may (but subject in any such case to the payments required
by Sections 3.1(b) and 3.9), provided that there shall exist no Default, upon
at least five Business Days' prior written, facsimile or telex notice to such
Bank and the Agent, identify to the Agent a lending institution reasonably
acceptable to the Agent which will purchase the Commitment and the amount of
outstanding Loans from the Bank providing such notice and such Bank shall
thereupon assign its Commitment, any Loans owing to such Bank and the Notes
held by such Bank to such replacement lending institution pursuant to Section
8.6. Such notice shall specify an effective date for such assignment and at
the time thereof, the Company shall pay all accrued interest, commitment fees
and all other amounts (including without limitation all amounts payable under
Article III) owing hereunder to such Bank as at such effective date for such
assignment.

6.2 Remedies.
--------

(a) Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent may, with the consent of the
Required Banks, and, upon being directed to do so by the Required Banks, shall
by notice to the Company (i) terminate the Commitments or (ii) declare the
outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, the Notes, all unpaid
reimbursement obligations in respect of drawings under Letters of Credit and
all other amounts owing under this Agreement to be immediately due and payable,
or (iii) demand immediate delivery of cash collateral, and the Company agrees
to deliver such cash collateral upon demand, in an amount equal to the maximum
amount that may be available to be drawn at any time prior to the stated expiry
of all outstanding Letters of Credit, or any one or more of the foregoing,
whereupon the Commitments shall terminate forthwith and all such amounts,
including such cash collateral, shall become immediately due and payable, as
the case may be, provided that in the case of any event or condition described
in Section 6.1(h) with respect to the Company, the Commitments shall
automatically terminate forthwith and all such amounts, including such cash
collateral, shall automatically become immediately due and payable without
notice; in all cases without demand, presentment, protest, diligence, notice of
dishonor or other formality, all of which are hereby expressly waived. Such
cash collateral delivered in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit shall be
deposited in a special cash collateral account to be held by the Agent as
collateral security for the payment and performance of the Company's
obligations under this Agreement to the Banks and the Agent.

(b) The Agent may, with the consent of the
Required Banks, and, upon being directed to do so by the Required Banks, shall,
in addition to the remedies provided in Section 6.2(a), exercise and enforce
any and all other rights and remedies available to it or the Banks, whether
arising under this Agreement, the Notes or any Security Document or under
applicable law, in any manner deemed appropriate by the Agent, including suit
in equity, action at law, or other appropriate proceedings, whether for the
specific performance (to the extent permitted by law) of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or in the Notes or any Security Document
or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Agreement, the Notes or
any Security Document.

-52-
<PAGE> 53
(c) Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Bank may, subject to Section 7.10, at
any time and from time to time, without notice to the Company (any requirement
for such notice being expressly waived by the Company) set off and apply
against any and all of the obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement, whether owing to such Bank or any other Bank or the
Agent, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank
to or for the credit or the account of the Company and any property of the
Company from time to time in possession of such Bank, irrespective of whether
or not such Bank shall have made any demand hereunder and although such
obligations may be contingent and unmatured. The Company hereby grants to the
Banks and the Agent a lien on and security interest in all such deposits,
indebtedness and property as collateral security for the payment and
performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. The rights
of such Bank under this Section 6.2(c) are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which such
Bank may have.

(d) In addition to other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement, the Company confirms that it shall further pay, together
with any payment of the Term Loans hereunder after the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default, all amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Section 3.9. The Company agrees that such amounts are a reasonable
pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amounts are payable as liquidated
damages for the loss of bargain and payment of such amount shall not in any way
reduce, affect or impair any other obligations of the Company under this
Agreement.

(e) All moneys received by the Agent on behalf of
the Banks from its exercise of remedies under this Agreement, the Notes, any
Security Document, any related documents or applicable law, shall be applied as
follows:

(i) First, to the payment of all
expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with the exercise of such rights
and remedies, including, without limitation, all costs and expenses of
collection, attorneys' fees, court costs and foreclosure expenses and all other
fees of the Agent;

(ii) Next, to the payment of the accrued
interest and principal balance then owing on the Notes and the reimbursement
and other obligations owing pursuant to the Letters of Credit, pro rata in
accordance with the amount thereof, and such amounts applied to any of the
Notes are to be allocated between interest and principal on each Note as
determined by the Bank holding such Note;

(iii) Next, to the payment of all other
amounts owed by the Company to any Bank or the Agent which are not under this
Agreement, including but not limited to Supplementary Loans prior to
refinancing under this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.1(e), but which are
secured by the Security Documents, pro rata in accordance with such amounts
owing; and

-53-
<PAGE> 54
(iv) Next, to the Company or such other
person as shall be legally entitled thereto.

ARTICLE VII
THE AGENT AND THE BANKS
-----------------------

7.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement, the Notes and the
Security Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or
thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The provisions of this Article VII are solely for the benefit of the Agent and
the Banks, and the Company shall not have any rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and
duties under this Agreement, the Agent shall act solely as agent of the Banks
and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation
towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Company.

7.2 Agent and Affiliates. NBD Bank, N.A. in its capacity
as a Bank hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any
other Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it
were not the Agent. NBD Bank, N.A. and its Affiliates (and any Bank) may
(without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend
money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial
advisory or other business with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as
if it were not acting as Agent hereunder, and may accept fees and other
consideration therefor without having to account for the same to the Banks.

7.3 Scope of Agent's Duties. The Agent shall have no
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein, and shall
not, by reason of this Agreement, have a fiduciary relationship with any Bank,
beyond the agency created herein and subject to the terms herein, and no
implied covenants, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist against the Agent. As to
any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, collection and enforcement actioned under the Notes and the
Security Documents), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion
or take any action, but the Agent shall take such action or omit to take any
action pursuant to the reasonably written instructions of the Required Banks
and may request instructions from the Required Banks. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, pursuant to
the written instructions of the Required Banks, which instructions and any
action or omission pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Banks;
provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to act or omit to act
if, in the judgment of the Agent, such action or omission may expose the Agent
to personal liability or is contrary to this Agreement, the Notes or the
Security Documents or applicable law.

7.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any certificate, notice, document or other communication (including
any cable, telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or oral communication)
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been

-54-
<PAGE> 55
sent or given by or on behalf of a proper person. The Agent may treat the
payee of any Note as the holder thereof. The Agent may employ agents
(including, without limitation, collateral agents) and may consult with legal
counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent public accounts and
other experts selected by it and shall not be liable to the Banks, except as to
money or property received by it or its authorized agents, for the negligence
or misconduct of any such agent selected by it with reasonable care or for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

7.5 Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless the
Agent has actual knowledge or has otherwise received written notice from a Bank
or the Company specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Agent receives
such a notice, the Agent shall promptly give written notice thereto to the
Banks. As used herein, "actual knowledge" shall mean the actual knowledge of
the responsible loan officer of the Agent, obtained in administering the
Company's account.

7.6 Liability of Agent. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents, or employees shall be liable to the Banks for any
action taken or not taken by it or them in connection herewith with the consent
or at the request of the Required Banks or in the absence of its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any recital, statement, warranty
or representation contained in this Agreement, any Note or any Security
Document, or in any certificate, report, financial statement or other document
furnished in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants or agreements of the Company or any Guarantor, (iii)
the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article II hereof, of (iv) the
validity, effectiveness, legal enforceability, value or genuineness of this
Agreement, the Notes or the Security Documents or any collateral subject
thereto or any other instrument or document furnished in connection herewith.

7.7 Nonreliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank
acknowledges and agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Company and decision to
enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance
upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and
decision in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. The Agent shall
not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by
the Company or any Guarantor of this Agreement, the Notes or the Security
Documents or any other documents referred to or provided for herein or to
inspect the properties or books of the Company or any Guarantor and, except for
notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be
furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any information concerning the
affairs, financial

-55-
<PAGE> 56
condition or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which may come
into the possession of the Agent or any of its Affiliates.

7.8 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company, but without limiting any
obligation of the Company to make such reimbursement), ratably according to the
respective principal amounts of the Advances then outstanding made by each of
them (or if no Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the
respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel)
which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement,
provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses resulting from the Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, fees and
expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the
extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company, but
without limiting the obligation of the Company to make such reimbursement.
Each Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any amounts owing to the Agent by the Banks pursuant to this Section.
If the indemnity furnished to the Agent under this Section shall, in the
judgment of the Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call
for additional indemnity from the Banks and cease, or not commence, to take any
action until such additional indemnity if furnished.

7.9 Resignation or Removal of Agent. The Agent may
resign as such at any time upon thirty days' prior written notice to the
Company and the Banks or may be removed for cause as such upon vote of the
Required Banks. In the event of any such resignation or removal, the Required
Banks shall, by an instrument in writing delivered to the Company and the
Agent, appoint a successor, with the consent of the Company, which shall be a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or any State
thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. If
a successor is not so appointed or does not accept such appointment before the
Agent's resignation or removal becomes effective, the resigning or removed
Agent may appoint a temporary successor to act until such appointment by the
Required Banks is made and accepted or if no such temporary successor is
appointed as provided above by the resigning or removed Agent, the Agent agrees
to continue to perform administrative duties hereunder for a fee to be agreed
upon at such time until such appointment by the Required Banks is made and
accepted. Any successor to the Agent shall execute and deliver to the Company
and the Banks an instrument accepting such appointment and thereupon such
successor Agent, without further act, deed, conveyance or transfer shall become
vested with all of the properties, rights, interests, powers, authorities and
obligations of its predecessor hereunder with like effect as if originally
named as Agent hereunder. Upon request of such successor Agent, the Company
and

-56-
<PAGE> 57
the resigning or removed Agent shall execute and deliver such instruments of
conveyance, assignment and further assurance and do such other things as may
reasonably be required for more fully and certainly vesting and confirming in
such successor Agent all such properties, rights, interests, powers,
authorities and obligations. The provisions of this Article VII shall
thereafter remain effective for such resigning or removed Agent with respect to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by such Agent while acting as the
Agent hereunder.

7.10 Sharing of Payments. The Banks agree among
themselves that, in the event that any Bank shall obtain payment in respect of
any Advance or any other obligation owing to the Banks under this Agreement
through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or
otherwise in excess of its ratable share of payments received by all of the
Banks on account of the Advances and other obligations (or if no Advances are
outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of the Commitments),
such Bank shall promptly purchase from the other Banks participations in such
Advances and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments
from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all of the Banks share
such payment in accordance with such ratable shares. The Banks further agree
among themselves that if payment to a Bank obtained by such Bank through the
exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise as
aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Bank which
shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of
participations theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each Bank
whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Company
agrees that any Bank so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including set-off,
banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Bank were a holder of such Advance or other obligation in the amount of
such participation. The Banks further agree among themselves that, in the
event that amounts received by the Banks and the Agent hereunder are
insufficient to pay all such obligations or insufficient to pay all such
obligations when due, the fees and other amounts owing to the Agent in such
capacity shall be paid therefrom before payment of obligations owing to the
Banks under this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, if any Bank or the Agent shall fail to remit to the Agent or any
other Bank an amount payable by such Bank or the Agent to the Agent or such
other Bank pursuant to this Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such
payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the
date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Agent or such
other Bank at a rate per annum equal to the rate at which borrowings are
available to the payee in its overnight federal funds market. It is further
understood and agreed among the Banks and the Agent that if the Agent shall
engage in any other transactions with the Company and shall have the benefit of
any collateral or security therefor which does not expressly secure the
obligations arising under this Agreement except by virtue of a so-called
dragnet clause or comparable provision, the Agent shall be entitled to apply
any proceeds of such collateral or security first in respect of the obligations
arising in connection with such other transaction before application to the
obligations arising under this Agreement.

-59-
<PAGE> 60
of the Agent and the Banks (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel

any Security Document or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of
the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement and (iv) all reasonable
costs and expenses of the Agent and the Banks (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with any action or proceeding relating to a
court order, injunction or other process or decree restraining or seeking to
restrain the Agent from paying any amount under, or otherwise relating in any
way to, any Letter of Credit and any and all costs and expenses which any of
them may incur relative to any payment under any Letter of Credit.

(b) The Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to
hold harmless the Banks and the Agent, and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind or nature
whatsoever which the Banks or the Agent or any such person may incur or which
may be claimed against any of them by reason of or in connection with any
Letter of Credit, and neither any Bank nor the Agent or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for:
(i) the use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or for any acts or
omissions of any beneficiary in connection therewith; (ii) the validity,
sufficiency or genuineness of documents or of any endorsement thereon, even if
such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (iii) payment by the Agent to the
beneficiary under any Letter of Credit against presentation of documents which
do not comply with the terms of any Letter of Credit, including failure of any
documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit;
(iv) any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or
delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any
Letter of Credit; or (v) any other event or circumstance whatsoever arising in
connection with any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be required to indemnify the Banks and the Agent and such other persons,
and the Banks shall be liable to the Company to the extent, but only to the
extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or incidental, damages
suffered by the Company which were caused by (A) the Agent's wrongful dishonor
of any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary
thereunder of a draft or other demand for payment and other documentation
strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, or
(B) the Agent's payment by the Agent to the beneficiary under any Letter of
Credit against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of
the Letter of Credit to the extent, but only to the extent, that such payment
constitutes gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent. It is
understood that in making any payment under a Letter of Credit the Agent will
rely on documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all
matters set forth therein without further investigation and regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary, and such reliance and payment against
documents presented under a Letter of Credit substantially complying with the
terms thereof shall not be deemed gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the
Agent in connection with such payment. It is further acknowledged and agreed
that the Company may have rights against the beneficiary or others in
connection with any Letter of Credit with respect to which the Banks are
alleged to be liable and it shall be a precondition of the assertion of any
liability

-60-
<PAGE> 61
of the Banks under this Section that the Company shall first have exhausted all
remedies in respect of the alleged loss against such beneficiary and any other
parties obligated or liable in connection with such Letter of Credit and any
related transactions.

(c) The Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to
hold harmless the Banks and the Agent, and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements incurred in connection
with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding whether or not
such person shall be designated as a party thereto) which the Banks or the
Agent or any such person may incur or which may be claimed against any of them
by reason of or in connection with entering into this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall not
be required to indemnify any such Bank and the Agent or such other person, to
the extent, but only to the extent, that such claim, damage, loss, liability,
cost or expense is attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be.

8.6 Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that the Company may not, without
the prior consent of the Banks, assign its rights or obligations hereunder or
under the Notes or any Security Document and the Banks shall not be obligated
to make any Advance hereunder to any entity other than the Company.

(b) Each Bank may, with the prior consent of the
Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), sell to any financial
institution or institutions, and such financial institution or institutions may
further sell, a participation interest (undivided or divided) in, the Advances
and such Bank's rights and benefits under this Agreement, the Notes and the
Security Documents, and to the extent of that participation interest such
participant or participants shall have the same rights and benefits against the
Company under Section 3.7, 3.9 and 6.2(c) as it or they would have had if such
participant or participants were the Bank making the Advances to the Company
hereunder, provided, however, that (i) such Bank's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unmodified and fully effective and enforceable against
such Bank, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank shall remain
the holder of its Notes for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Company,
the Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, and (v) such Bank shall not grant to its participant any rights to
consent or withhold consent to any action taken by such Bank or the Agent under
this Agreement other than action requiring the consent of all of the Banks
hereunder.

(c) The Agent from time to time in its sole
discretion may appoint agents for the purpose of servicing and administering
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and enforcing or
exercising any rights or remedies of the Agent provided under this Agreement,
the Notes, any Security Documents or otherwise. In furtherance of such agency,
the Agent may from time to time direct that the Company and the Guarantors
provide

-61-
<PAGE> 62
notices, reports and other documents contemplated by this Agreement (or
duplicates thereof) to such agent. The Company and each Guarantor hereby
consents to the appointment of such agent and agrees to provide all such
notices, reports and other documents and to otherwise deal with such agent
acting on behalf of the Agent in the same manner as would be required if
dealing with the Agent itself.

(d) Each Bank may, with the prior consent of the
Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Agent, assign to one
or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it);
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a uniform, and not
a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations, (ii) except in the case of
an assignment of all of a Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
(A) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Bank being assigned pursuant
to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and
Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than
$10,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 thereafter, or such lesser
amount as the Company and the Agent may consent to and (B) after giving effect
to each such assignment, the amount of the remaining Commitment of the
assigning Bank shall in no event be less than $10,000,000; provided, that, the
Revolving Credit Commitment of the Agent shall in no event be less than the
lesser of (x) $25,000,000 or (y) an amount equal to 25% of the aggregate
Revolving Credit Commitments, (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the
Register, an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit M hereto (an
"Assignment and Acceptance"), together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,000, and (iv) any Bank
may without the consent of the Company or the Agent, and without paying any
fee, assign to any Affiliate of such Bank that is a bank or financial
institution all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective
date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder and (y) the Bank assignor
thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its
rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion of
an assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank
shall cease to be a party hereto).

(e) By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Bank assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to
and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other
than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Bank makes
no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Bank makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no

-62-
<PAGE> 63
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Company or the
performance or observance by the Company of any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii)
such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together
with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.6 and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv)
such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such
assigning Bank or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that
by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank.

(f) The Agent shall maintain at its address
designated on the signature pages hereof a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation
of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Advances owing to, each Bank from time to time (the "Register").
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error, and the Company, the Agent and the Banks may treat each
person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Company or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

(g) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee, together with any
Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment
and Acceptance has been completed, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance,
(ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give
prompt notice thereof to the Company. Within five Business Days after its
receipt of such notice, the Company, at the expense of the assigning Bank,
shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or
Notes a new Note to the order of such assignee in an amount equal to the
Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the
assigning Bank has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of
the assigning Bank in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it
hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes and
shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance.

(h) The Company shall not be liable for any costs
or expenses of any Bank in effectuating any participation or assignment under
this Section 8.6.

(i) The Banks may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to
this Section 8.6, disclose to the assignee or

-63-
<PAGE> 64
participant or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries required to be delivered by the Company pursuant
to Section 5.1(d).

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth
in this Agreement, any Bank may at any time create a security interest in, or
assign, all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in
favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; provided that such creation of a
security interest or assignment shall not release such Bank from its
obligations under this Agreement.

8.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by
signing any such counterpart.

8.8 Governing Law. This Agreement is a contract made
under, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with, the law of
the State of Michigan in the same manner applicable to contracts made and to be
performed entirely within such State and without giving effect to choice of law
principles of such State. Nothing in this paragraph shall, however, infer that
any Bank, other than NBD Bank, N.A., is doing business in Michigan as a result
of its participation herein. The Company further agrees that any legal action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, the Notes or any Security
Document or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in any court of
the State of Michigan, or in any court of the United States of America sitting
in Michigan, and the Company hereby submits to and accepts generally and
unconditionally the jurisdiction of those courts with respect to its person and
property, and irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System, whose address in
Michigan is 615 Griswold Street, Detroit, Michigan 48226, as its agent for
service of process and irrevocably consents to the service of process in
connection with any such action or proceeding by personal delivery to such
agent or to the Company or by the mailing thereof by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid to the Company at its address set forth in Section 8.2.
Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right of the Banks and the Agent to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law or limit the right of the
Banks or the Agent to bring any such action or proceeding against the Company
or property in the courts of any other jurisdiction. The Company hereby
irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit or
proceeding in the above described courts.

8.9 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of
contents and the headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for the
convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify any of the terms or
provisions hereof.

8.10 Construction of Certain Provisions. If any provision
of this Agreement refers to any action to be taken by any person, or which such
person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether
such action is taken directly or indirectly by such person, whether or not
expressly specified in such provision.

-64-
<PAGE> 65
8.11 Integration and Severability. This Agreement
embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and the
Agent and the Banks, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
relating to the subject matter hereof. In case any one or more of the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any Security
Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining obligations of the
Company shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in one jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of the obligations of the Company
under this Agreement, the Notes or any Security Document in any other
jurisdiction.

8.12 Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder
shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition
is not permitted by any such covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by
an exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of, another
covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default or
any event or condition which with notice or lapse of time, or both, could
become such a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or such
condition exists.

8.13 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement, the Notes or any Security Document, in no event
shall the amount of interest paid or agreed to be paid by the Company exceed an
amount computed at the highest rate of interest permissible under applicable
law. If, from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of
this Agreement, the Notes or any Security Document at the time performance of
such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the interest rate
limitation validly prescribed by law which a court of competent jurisdiction
may deem applicable hereto, then, ipso facto, the obligations to be fulfilled
shall be reduced to an amount computed at the highest rate of interest
permissible under applicable law, and if for any reason whatsoever the Bank
shall ever receive as interest an amount which would be deemed unlawful under
such applicable law such interest shall be automatically applied to the payment
of principal of the Advances outstanding hereunder (whether or not then due and
payable) and not to the payment of interest, or shall be refunded to the
Company if such principal and all other obligations of the Company to the Banks
have been paid in full.

8.14 Additional Banks. Additional lenders may also become
Banks hereunder and the aggregate amount of the Commitments hereunder shall
increase accordingly, with the prior written consent of the Company, the Banks
and the Agent, by executing an Assumption Agreement substantially in the form
of Exhibit N hereto provided that each of the Banks shall have the right of
first refusal to accept a pro rata increase in the amount of the increased
Commitments before any additional lender is added hereto. Upon any Bank being
added hereto, a new schedule will be distributed by the Agent to all Banks and
the Company showing the Commitment amount and the pro rata share of each Bank.

8.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BANKS, THE AGENT AND THE
COMPANY, AFTER CONSULTING OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH
COUNSEL, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EITHER OF
THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

-65-
<PAGE> 66
LITIGATION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED
INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF EITHER OF THEM. NEITHER THE BANK, THE AGENT NOR THE
COMPANY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE, BY COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHERWISE, ANY SUCH
ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A
JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. THESE PROVISIONS SHALL NOT BE
DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN ANY RESPECT OR RELINQUISHED BY THE BANKS, THE
AGENT OR THE COMPANY EXCEPT BY A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT EXECUTED BY ALL OF THEM. IT
IS INTENDED THAT THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY COUNTERCLAIMS, RIGHTS AND
DEFENSES IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.

8.16 Indebtedness Under Existing Loan Agreement. The
Loans and Advances made pursuant to Article II are in substitution for the
loans and advances made under the Existing Loan Agreement and the Notes
delivered to the Banks hereunder are delivered in exchange and in substitution
for the notes issued pursuant to the Existing Loan Agreement. The commitments
under the Existing Loan Agreement are superseded and replaced by the
Commitments hereunder. The initial Loans hereunder shall be used to pay all
Indebtedness owing under the notes issued pursuant to the Existing Loan
Agreement.

Closing under clause 2.2(a).

2.5 If any payment is made by the Seller or Akzo to the Buyer under or in 
respect of any breach of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any 
payment pursuant to any Claim) the payment shall so far as possible be treated 
as a reduction in the price paid for the Shares.

2.6 Cambrex may, prior to Closing, nominate a subsidiary of Cambrex to be

into the Deed of Adherence with such subsidiary providing for it to be the

Page 19
<PAGE> 23

(b) to pay to the Buyer or Cambrex (or, if so directed by the

further consideration, to the Buyer or Cambrex all

or services were provided during the twelve (12) months
immediately preceding Closing.

7.2 The Seller, Akzo, the Buyer and Cambrex agree that the

contamination or to treat such contamination not required by the Applicable

in respect of which the Seller may have any liability under this Agreement

carrying out other actions in the normal course of business. In carrying out
any action which may lead to the imposition of a legal requirement as
aforesaid, the Buyer shall and shall procure that the Acquired Group shall make
reasonable efforts to minimise the amount of any liability on the Seller and

Seller's Business Unit Diosynth in relation to
the products manufactured by it at the Closing
Date but not in relation to products which are at

8.2 The Seller and Akzo shall not (and shall procure that each
other member of the Retained Group shall not) within a period of three (3)

that the Seller may keep one (1) set of all data provided to the Buyer prior to
Closing for archival purposes to be kept strictly confidential by Akzo's Law
Department.

8.4 Each of the Seller and Akzo acknowledges and agrees that
each of clauses 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 constitutes an entirely separate and
independent restriction and that the duration, extent and application of each
restriction are no greater than is reasonable and necessary for the protection
of the interests of the Buyer but that, if any such restriction shall be
adjudged by any court or authority of competent jurisdiction to be void or
unenforceable but would be valid if part of the wording thereof were to be
deleted and/or the period thereof were to be reduced and/or the area dealt with
thereby were to be reduced, the said restriction shall apply within the
jurisdiction of that court or competent authority with such modifications as
are necessary to make it valid and effective.

(i) any repayment of any insurance proceeds which is
required by any insurance company which has
settled a claim in respect of such incident, for
any reason whatsoever including in particular any
allegations of gross negligence on behalf of any
member of the Acquired Group or any director,
officer, employee or agent thereof; and

(ii) any repayment or reimbursement of any insurance
proceeds received in respect of replacement of
plant and equipment of any of the Acquired Group
PROVIDED THAT Cambrex has complied with, so far
as is, in its reasonable opinion, consistent with
its commercial objectives, the capital
expenditure obligations in respect of replacement
of plant and equipment of any of the Acquired
Group of the Settlement Agreement dated 21
October 1992 between the Subsidiary and Skandia
Industri Forsakrings AB;

(e) the ownership by the Company of the Dormant Subsidiaries,
or otherwise in relation to the Dormant Subsidiaries,
whether arising before, at or after Closing;

(f) any matter or liability of Cambrex, the Acquired Group or
the Buyer occurring or arising as a result of the
notification by the United States Environmental Protection

with regard to the clean up of the "Lakeway Site" situate
in Muskegan, Michigan.

9.9 To the extent that the Acquired Group would have had the
benefit of any insurance policy effected by Akzo, the Seller or any member of
the Retained Group at the time at which any of the matters referred to in
clause 9.8(d) occurred, the Seller and Akzo agree to assist the Buyer and
Cambrex (or, if so directed by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Acquired Group) at any
time after Closing in making claims in respect of any such matters under any
such insurance policy. To the extent that recovery is made by the Buyer,
Cambrex or the Acquired Group under any policy of insurance in relation to a
matter which gives rise to a claim under clause 9.8(d), the amount recovered
shall be deducted from the amount which the Seller or Akzo is liable to pay
pursuant to such claim.

9.10 Each of Cambrex and the Buyer undertakes to notify Akzo
promptly if it becomes aware of any circumstance prior to the Closing Date
which would give rise to a claim under this Agreement.

9.11 The Buyer and Cambrex undertake to the Seller that, to the
extent that recovery may be made by the Buyer, Cambrex or any member of the
Acquired Group under an existing policy of insurance in relation to a matter
which gives rise to a Claim or a claim under clause 9.8(d), the Buyer and
Cambrex shall, and shall procure that the relevant member of the Acquired Group
shall, use reasonable endeavours to recover under such policy before seeking to
recover any amounts due from Akzo or the Seller in respect of the Claim or
claim under clause 9.8(d). To the extent that recovery is made by the Buyer,
Cambrex or the Acquired Group under any policy of insurance in relation to a
matter which gives rise to a Claim or claim under clause 9.8(d), the amount
recovered shall be deducted from the amount which the Seller or Akzo is liable
to pay pursuant to such Claim or claim under clause 9.8(d).

9.12 In the event of any conflict between the Warranties and
any indemnity in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the
Indemnities) it is agreed between the parties hereto that the terms of such
indemnity shall prevail.

make a claim against the Seller or Akzo under any Indemnity:-

(a) the Buyer or Cambrex shall give notice of such claim to
the Seller or Akzo as soon as is reasonably practicable
and shall procure that the relevant member of the Acquired

BUYER'S AND CAMBREX'S RIGHTS

11.1 The Buyer or Cambrex may by written notice given to the
Seller at any time prior to Closing rescind this Agreement without liability on
the part of the Buyer or Cambrex if any fact, matter or event (whether existing
or occurring on or before the date of this Agreement or arising or occurring
afterwards) comes to the notice of the Buyer or Cambrex at any time prior to
Closing which constitutes a material breach by the Seller of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any breach of the pre-Closing undertakings in

12.4 If the Seller or Akzo becomes aware that any claim has

the interests and reasonable requests of the
Retained Group at all times;

ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITIES

GENERAL INDEMNITY

13.1(a) The Seller undertakes and agrees (without limiting any
other rights of the Indemnified Parties in any way,
including rights to damages in respect of a claim for the
breach of any term of this Agreement) to indemnify and
hold harmless the Buyer and Cambrex (or, if so directed by
the Buyer or Cambrex, the Acquired Group) from and against
all Costs howsoever arising relating to any Environmental
Matter in relation to the Properties or the Acquired
Group. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause 13.1(a)
shall not apply to:

(i) Remedial Action Programme Costs (which are dealt
with under clauses 13.2 and 13.3 below);

(ii) Permit Compliance Costs (which are dealt with
under clause 13.7 below); and

(iii) other Costs to the extent that they arise out of
the ownership, use, handling, control or operation
by the Indemnified Parties of the Properties or
the businesses of the Acquired Group after
Closing.

(b) To the extent that claims under this clause 13.1 relate to
harm sustained by or on the Properties the Seller's
liability shall be subject to the Cap (as provided for in
clause 13.5 below) and the Seller shall only be liable if
the costs relating to such claims are incurred within the
period of twenty (20) years after the Closing Date or
within such longer period as the parties, acting
reasonably, may agree. For the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent that claims under this clause 13.1 relate to harm
sustained or other Environmental Matter arising outside
the Properties, the Seller shall be liable without limit
as to time or amount.

Page 33
<PAGE> 37

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Costs which would be Remedial
Action Programme Costs or Permit Compliance Costs if they
had been incurred within the relevant periods of time
applicable to such Costs, shall not be recoverable from
the Seller under this clause 13.1 but shall only be
recoverable, if at all, under clauses 13.2, 13.3 or 13.6
as appropriate.

REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAMME COST SHARING

13.2 Subject to clauses 13.5 and 13.6 all Remedial Action
Programme Costs which are attributable wholly to Existing Conditions shall be
shared between the Indemnified Parties and the Seller in the following manner:

(a) Remedial Action Programme Costs incurred in each calendar
year of employing external legal advisors or technical
consultants for the purposes of reviewing Applicable Laws,
liaising with competent authorities and generally advising
the Indemnified Parties shall be borne by the Indemnified
Parties up to the cumulative value of the Swedish Krona
equivalent of NLG 400,000 calculated on the Closing
Exchange Rate basis. All such Remedial Action Programme
Costs so incurred in each calendar year by the Indemnified
Parties above the said amount shall be borne equally
between, on the one hand, the relevant Indemnified Party
and, on the other hand, the Seller;

(b) Remedial Action Programme Costs incurred in the employment
of technical or other consultants for the purposes of
ascertaining the presence or extent of any contamination
at, or otherwise ascertaining the condition of the
Properties, and of formulating a plan of clean-up,
containment or other remedial action shall be borne
equally between, on the one hand, the relevant Indemnified
Party and, on the other hand, the Seller;

(c) Remedial Action Programme Costs incurred in carrying out
physical clean-up, containment or other remedial or other
works shall be borne ninety per cent. (90%) by the Seller
on the one hand and ten per cent. (10%) by the relevant
Indemnified Party on the other hand;

(d) the Seller shall reimburse the Buyer and/or Cambrex (or,
if so directed by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Acquired
Group) for all sums due under this clause within
twenty-one (21) days of receiving a written demand to do
so with documentary evidence of the Costs incurred and
paid.

13.3 Remedial Action Programme Costs which are directly or
indirectly attributable:

(a) partly to Existing Conditions; and

Page 34
<PAGE> 38

(b) partly to the ownership, use, handling, control or
operation of the Properties by the Buyer or the Acquired
Group after Closing,

shall be fairly apportioned between the relevant Indemnified Party and the
Seller as agreed between them or, failing such agreement, as shall be
determined by arbitrators pursuant to clause 27.3, taking into account only the
provisions of clause 13.2, the extent to which the Costs in question are
attributable to (a) and (b) above, and the steps taken (if any) by the
Indemnified Parties to avoid, limit, reduce or otherwise mitigate the risk of
incurring the relevant Remedial Action Programme Costs and their amount insofar
as such steps relate to Existing Conditions.

CONTROL OVER REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAMME AND OTHER ACTION IN RELATION TO
PROPERTIES OTHER THAN THE KARLSKOGA SITE

13.4 The Buyer, after Closing, shall and shall procure that the
other Indemnified Parties shall make reasonable efforts to secure that any
clean-up, containment or other programme of remedial action and any other
action to which the Costs referred to in clauses 13.2(a) and 13.2(b) relate and
which are carried out on or in relation to Properties other than the Karlskoga
Site shall be carried out under the control of either the Buyer or another
Indemnified Party with the aim of securing that the Costs of such action shall
be Remedial Action Programme Costs.

THE CAP

13.5(a) The aggregate of:

(i) Remedial Action Programme Costs;

(ii) Permit Compliance Costs; and

(iii) other Costs relating to harm sustained by or on
the Properties as referred to in clause 13.1(b) 
above,

to be borne by the Seller, together with any additional amounts paid in respect
thereof by the Seller pursuant to clause 15 in respect of any charge to tax in
relation to the matters in clause 13.5(a)(i) to (iii) above, shall not exceed
the Swedish Krona equivalent of forty two million five hundred thousand Dutch
Guilders (NLG 42,500,000) calculated on the Closing Exchange Rate basis (the
CAP).

(b) If the annual rate of inflation as measured by the Swedish
Producers' Price Index for the Chemical Industry (the SPPI
INFLATION RATE) over the first ten (10) years after the
Closing Date shall average more than five per cent. (5%)
per year, the Cap shall thereafter be adjusted annually on
the anniversary of the Closing Date in the following way:

Page 35
<PAGE> 39

-- the Cap shall be decreased by any amounts
paid by the Seller in respect of the Costs
referred to in clause 13.5(a) above (the
REDUCED CAP); and then

-- the Reduced Cap shall be increased by an
amount equal to the SPPI Inflation Rate
(applicable for the year in question)
multiplied by the Reduced Cap.

INSURANCE AND GRANTS

13.6(a) Where:

(i) Remedial Action Programme Costs;

(ii) Permit Compliance Costs; or

(iii) other Costs relating to harm sustained by or on
the Properties as referred to in clause 13.1(b) 
above,

are met, either wholly or partly, by insurance or by governmental or other
grants directly relating to the Costs incurred, the sums payable by the Seller
in respect of such Costs shall be reduced in the following way:

-- the amount of such insurance (less the costs of
recovery) or grant shall be deducted from such 
Costs (the REDUCED COSTS); and then

-- the Reduced Costs shall be regarded as such Costs
for the purpose of calculating the Seller's 
liability.

(b) The Buyer shall use its, and shall procure after Closing
that the Acquired Group shall use its, reasonable
endeavours to seek recovery under any applicable policy of
insurance or to obtain governmental or other grants where
these are available, to reduce the Seller's liability as
provided for in this clause 13.

PERMIT COMPLIANCE COST SHARING

13.7(a) Subject to clauses 13.5 (The Cap) and 13.6 (Insurance and
Grants) Permit Compliance Costs to the extent that they
exceed in aggregate one hundred and seventy five million
Swedish Krona (SEK 175,000,000), shall be borne equally
between the Indemnified Parties on the one hand and the
Seller on the other hand. The Seller shall from time to
time reimburse the Buyer and Cambrex (or, if so directed
by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Acquired Group) accordingly
within twenty one (21) days of receiving a written demand
to do so with documentary evidence of the Permit
Compliance Costs incurred and paid.

Page 36
<PAGE> 40

(b) The Seller shall only be liable for Permit Compliance
Costs which are incurred after the Closing Date and within
three (3) years after the date on which the Outstanding
Environmental Permit is granted, or, if later, within
three (3) years after the date on which the relevant term
or condition of the Outstanding Environmental Permit is
finally determined whether by appeal or otherwise. The
Seller shall not be liable, however, for any Permit
Compliance Costs incurred more than five (5) years after
the date on which the Outstanding Environmental Permit is
granted.

(c) The provisions of this clause 13.7 shall cease to apply if
the Outstanding Environmental Permit has not been granted
within three (3) years after the Closing Date. This
period shall, however, be extended as necessary to allow
for any appeal which may be made during that period
against a refusal of the Outstanding Environmental Permit
to be finally determined.

REFUSAL OF THE OUTSTANDING ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT

13.8 If, within the period of three (3) years after the Closing
Date, and despite the Buyer's and the Acquired Group's reasonable efforts, the
renewal or grant of the Outstanding Environmental Permit is refused and, as a
consequence thereof, the Acquired Group is forced substantially to discontinue
the operations at the Properties, then the Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement and the Profarmaco Agreement jointly. In case of such
termination, clause 13.11 shall apply.

UNDULY ONEROUS CONDITIONS OF THE OUTSTANDING ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT

13.9(a) If, within the period of three (3) years after the Closing
Date, the Outstanding Environmental Permit is granted and
the Buyer forms its reasonable estimation that the terms
and conditions thereof (the PERMIT CONDITIONS) are unduly
onerous, then the Buyer shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement and the Profarmaco Agreement jointly. In
case of such termination clause 13.11 shall apply. The
Permit Conditions shall be regarded as being unduly
onerous if, to the extent that they relate to the types of
activities carried out at the Properties at or within
three (3) years before the Closing Date, compliance
therewith would in the Buyer's reasonable estimation:

(i) require, in aggregate, expenditure by, or result
in a loss to, the Indemnified Parties in excess
of five hundred million Swedish Krona (SEK
500,000,000); or

(ii) require the Acquired Group, substantially to
discontinue the operations at the Properties
within the period of ten (10) years after the
date on which the Outstanding Environmental
Permit is granted.

Page 37
<PAGE> 41

The issue of whether the Permit Conditions are unduly onerous shall be notified
by the Buyer to the Seller. If the Seller disagrees with such notification,
then the issue shall be submitted for determination to arbitration in
accordance with clause 27.3.

(b) If, within the period of three (3) years after the Closing
Date, the Buyer concludes that in the Buyer's reasonable
estimation the Permit Conditions are not unduly onerous,
it shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter,
notify the Seller that the right of the Buyer to terminate
this Agreement under clause 13.8 has not arisen, whereupon
the Buyer's rights so to terminate shall lapse.

APPEALS

13.10 To the extent allowed by the Applicable Laws, the Buyer or
the Acquired Group shall appeal against a refusal of the Outstanding
Environmental Permit or against unduly onerous Permit Conditions if:

(i) the Buyer or the Acquired Group is advised and
reasonably considers that such appeal has a
reasonable prospect of success; or
(ii) the Seller has unconditionally and irrevocably
agreed to bear the Costs of such appeal.

TERMINATION

13.11(a) The right to terminate this Agreement and the Profarmaco
Agreement jointly set out in clauses 13.8 and 13.9 shall
lapse if not exercised within six (6) months of the date
on which such right arises or, if an appeal has been made
in accordance with clause 13.10 above, within six (6)
months of the date of final determination of that appeal,
whichever is the later.

(b) Before exercising its right of termination contained in
clauses 13.7 and 13.8 the Buyer shall give the Seller the
opportunity to comment on the proposed exercise of the
said right and the parties shall engage in good faith in a
process of consultation with a view, inter alia, to
identifying ways in which the exercise of the said right
might be avoided;

(c) The Seller shall, within seven (7) days of receiving
written notice from the Buyer that the Buyer is able and
wishes to enforce its rights of termination contained in
clauses 13.8 and 13.9, or within seven (7) days of the
decision of the arbitrators if the issue of whether the
Permit Conditions are unduly onerous has been submitted to
arbitration, repay to the Buyer all sums paid to the
Seller under this Agreement and the Buyer shall transfer
the Shares back to the Seller as soon as reasonably
practicable following receipt of such sums. Upon the
completed transfers described in this clause, this
Agreement shall be of no further force and effect save as
to clauses 19, 20, 26 and 27 (but without prejudice to any

Page 38
<PAGE> 42

claims a party may have for an antecedent breach). In the
case of termination the Seller and the Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to achieve an equitable settlement
on restitution having due and proper regard to the
parties' position at Closing.

INFORMATION SHARING AND COOPERATION

13.12 If the Buyer becomes aware of any matter which the Buyer
reasonably considers may give rise to a claim under these Environmental
Indemnities, the Buyer shall as soon as reasonably practicable give the Seller
written notice containing details (where possible) of the matter, including any
proposed Permit Compliance Work or Remedial Action Programme and including the
Buyer's estimate (on a without prejudice basis) of the cost of such action.
The Buyer shall use and shall cause the Acquired Group to use its reasonable
endeavours to minimise both the Permit Compliance Costs or the Remedial Action
Programme Costs and any disruptive effect of such action on the business of the
Buyer and the Acquired Group. The Buyer and the Seller shall engage in a
process of prompt, mutual information exchange and consultation concerning the
proposed responses to such matter, such exchanges and consultations to include,
where appropriate, but not be limited to the following:

(i) any communications of any nature concerning such
matter;

(ii) identification and employment of legal and
technical experts;

(iii) design and implementation of response activities;

(iv) negotiations with governmental entities and/or
potential third party claimants; and

(v) the Seller's consent to the use of expertise
internal to the Buyer or the Acquired Group, the
Seller's consent to the use of such expertise not
to be unreasonably withheld.

Nothing in this clause 13.12 shall prevent or restrict the Buyer or the
Acquired Group from taking any action without complying with this clause 13.12
if the Buyer or the relevant member of the Acquired Group reasonably believes
that the taking of that action is urgently necessary to avoid, limit, reduce or
otherwise mitigate the risk of incurring Costs which would give rise to a claim
or claims against the Seller under these Environmental Indemnities. However,
if reasonably possible, such action shall only be taken by the Buyer in
consultation in good faith with the Seller.

RIGHT TO ASSIGN REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAMME COST AND PERMIT COMPLIANCE COST
SHARING PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL INDEMNITIES

13.13(a) If, after Closing, the Buyer sells or otherwise transfers
the Shares or the Properties to a third party, the Buyer
shall be entitled to assign to that

Page 39
<PAGE> 43

third party the benefits contained in clauses 13.2, 13.3
and 13.7 or any of them (the ability to require the Seller
to bear a proportion of Remedial Action Programme Costs
and Permit Compliance Costs) and the benefit of this
clause 13.13(a), subject to (to the extent permissible by
the relevant law governing the said sale or transfer) the
provisions of clauses 10.7, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6 and 13.12.
The Buyer shall consult with the Seller before exercising
its right to assign under this clause 13.13(a);

(b) If:

(i) the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise
transfers the Shares or the Properties to a third
party; and

(ii) the said third party is able to and does recover
from the Seller sums in respect of Remedial Action
Programme Costs and/or Permit Compliance Costs
over and above those which would have been payable
by the Seller to the Buyer (or to another
Indemnified Party) had the said sale or transfer
to the third party not taken place (the EXCESS
COSTS),

the Buyer undertakes and agrees to indemnify the Seller and Akzo in respect of
the Excess Costs.

(c) If the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers
the Shares or the Properties to a third party and assigns
to that third party the benefits contained in clauses
13.2, 13.3 and 13.7 or any of them as provided for in
clause 13.13(a) above, but, notwithstanding such
assignment, the said third party is able to and does
recover from the Buyer or from another Indemnified Party
Costs which, by virtue of the assignment, could have been
recoverable from the Seller, the Seller undertakes and
agrees to indemnify the Buyer and Cambrex (or, if so
directed by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Acquired Group) in
respect of such Costs.

(d) If the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers
part of the Shares or the Properties to a third party the
provisions of clauses 13.13(a), 13.13(b) and 13.13(c)
above shall apply pro rata the proportion that the said
part bears to the whole of the Shares or the Properties as
the case may be.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of clauses
13.13(b), 13.13(c) and 13.13(d) above are intended to
place the parties to this Agreement, in the event that the
Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers the
Shares or the Properties (or a part thereof) to a third
party in the same position as they would have been had
such sale or transfer not taken place. If necessary in
order to achieve this result, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to reach whatever supplemental agreement, if
any, is required.

<PAGE> 44

PENSION SCHEMES

14.1 All future liabilities of the Acquired Group for
contributions to pension schemes shall be for the account of the Acquired Group
with effect from Closing.

14.2 The Seller and Akzo shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer and Cambrex (or, if so directed by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Acquired
Group) for any liability for provision of pension benefits (including
contributions to any relevant state pension schemes and, in Sweden, the ITP
Insurance Scheme) to any employee of the Acquired Group accrued under Swedish
GAAP up to the Closing Date to the extent that liability therefor exceeds by
more than five per cent (5%) the provision in the Last Accounts.

GROSSING UP

15. If any tax authority brings into charge to tax any sum
paid by the Seller or Akzo hereunder (including any circumstances where any
relief is available in respect of such charge to tax), then the Seller or Akzo
shall pay such additional amount as shall be required to ensure that the total
amount paid, less the tax chargeable on such amount (or that would be so
chargeable but for such relief), is equal to the amount that would otherwise be
payable hereunder PROVIDED THAT, but without prejudice to the foregoing, any
sum paid by the Seller or Akzo in respect of a Cost suffered or incurred by an
Indemnified Party shall be reduced to the extent that such Indemnified Party
benefits from a tax deduction or allowance in relation to such Cost.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT

16. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties in connection with the sale and purchase of
the Shares. None of the parties to this Agreement has entered into this
Agreement in reliance upon any representation, warranty or undertaking which is
not set out or referred to in this Agreement.

VARIATION

17. No variation of this Agreement (or of any of the documents
referred to herein) shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by or on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. The expression "variation" shall include
any variation, supplement, deletion or replacement however effected.

Page 41
<PAGE> 45

ASSIGNMENT

18. Subject to clause 13.13, none of the parties to this
Agreement shall be entitled to assign the benefit of any provision of this
Agreement without the prior written approval of the other parties, except for
an assignment, in the case of the Seller, to a member of the Retained Group,
or, in the case of Cambrex or the Buyer, to another subsidiary of Cambrex.

ANNOUNCEMENTS

19. No announcement or circular in connection with the
existence or the subject matter of this Agreement shall be made or issued by or
on behalf of the Seller or the Buyer or any other member of the Retained Group
or Cambrex and/or its Subsidiaries without the prior written approval of the
Buyer or the Seller as applicable during any period before or within nine (9)
months after Closing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
This shall not affect any announcement or circular required by law or the rules
of any stock exchange and, in particular but without limitation, Cambrex shall
retain full authority to make an announcement in connection with the subject
matter of this Agreement in order to comply with any rule or regulation of the
US Securities Exchange Commission, it being understood that Akzo shall be
previously consulted on any such announcement and that Cambrex shall take into
due consideration any reasonable request by Akzo in this respect.

COSTS

20. Subject to clause 10.2(b)(ii) and except as otherwise
specified in this Agreement, each of the parties shall pay its own costs
incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation and implementation of
this Agreement.

INVALIDITY

21. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid
or unenforceable, then such provision shall (so far as it is invalid or
unenforceable) be given no effect and shall be deemed not to be included in
this Agreement but without invalidating any of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement. The parties shall then use all reasonable endeavours to replace the
invalid or unenforceable provisions by a valid provision the effect of which is
as close as possible to the intended effect of the invalid or unenforceable
provision.

COUNTERPARTS

22. This Agreement may be entered into in any number of
counterparts and by the parties to it on separate counterparts, each of which,
when executed and

Page 42
<PAGE> 46

delivered, shall be an original, but all the counterparts shall together
constitute one and the same instrument.

Buyer and/or Cambrex during the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement 
and all information listed in the Data Room Index is, in all material respects, 
true, accurate and not misleading PROVIDED THAT where forecasts, projections 
or estimations are made in the information listed in the Data Room Index no 
warranty is expressed as to the accuracy of such forecasts, projections or

management accounts and budgets for the Acquired Group.

THE SELLER AND AKZO

OWNERSHIP OF THE SELLER AND AUTHORISATIONS

from all security interests, options, equities, claims or other third

PAGE 52
<PAGE> 56

FINANCIAL MATTERS

ACCOUNTS

3.1(a) The Last Accounts of each member of the Acquired Group give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of that member of the Acquired 
Group as at the Last Accounts Date and of their results for the 
financial year ended on the Last Accounts Date.

(b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), except as stated 
in its Accounts, no changes in the accounting policies were made by 
the Acquired Group in any of its three (3) financial years ended on 
the Last Accounts Date.

MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS

3.2(a) The unaudited management accounts of the Acquired Group for all 
monthly periods ended after the Last Accounts Date were properly 
prepared in a manner consistent with that adopted in the preparation 
of its management accounts for all periods ended during the twelve 
months prior to the Last Accounts Date.

(b) The Balance Sheet is not misleading in any material respect and 
neither materially over-states the value of the assets nor materially 
under-states the liabilities of the Acquired Group as at the dates to
which it was drawn up and does not materially over-state the profits 
of the Acquired Group in respect of the periods to which it relates.

POSITION SINCE LAST ACCOUNTS DATE

3.3(a) Since the Last Accounts Date there has been no material adverse 
change in the financial or trading position of the Acquired Group and, 
so far as the Seller is aware no event, fact or matter (which is not 
in the public domain) has occurred which is likely to give rise to 
any such change.

(b) Since the Last Accounts Date, except as specifically provided for in 
this Agreement:

(i) the businesses of the Acquired Group have been carried 
on in the ordinary and usual course and none of the 
Acquired Group has made or agreed to make any payment

(v) except for Approved Projects no contract,
liability or commitment (whether in respect of
capital expenditure or otherwise) has been

long term or unusual nature and which involved or
could involve an obligation of a material nature
or magnitude (a liability for expenditure in
excess of Swedish Krona five million (SEK
5,000,000) being regarded as MATERIAL for this
purpose);

(vi) no change has been made in terms of employment,
including pension commitments, by the Acquired
Group other than those required by law and any
relevant merit and promotional increase has been
made in the ordinary course of business and in
accordance with past practices;

(vii) no resolution of the shareholders of the Acquired
Group has been passed in relation to the
foregoing matters whether in general meeting or
otherwise (other than resolutions relating to the
routine business of annual general meetings).

ACCOUNTING AND OTHER RECORDS

3.4(a) The statutory books, books of account and other records of
the Acquired Group:

(i) are materially complete, up-to-date and have been
maintained in accordance with all applicable laws
and generally accepted accounting practices on a
proper and consistent basis;

(ii) are in its possession or under its control
together with all documents of title and executed
copies of all existing agreements to which any
member the Acquired Group is a party.

(b) All the accounting records and systems (including but not
limited to computerised accounting systems) of the
Acquired Group are recorded, stored, maintained or
operated or otherwise held by the Acquired Group and are
not wholly or partly dependent on any facilities or
systems which are not under the exclusive ownership or
control of the Acquired Group.

(c) Each member of the Acquired Group is licensed to use all
software necessary to enable it to continue to use its
computerised records for the foreseeable future in the
same manner in which they have been used prior to the date
of this Agreement and does not share any user rights in
respect of such software with any other person.

PAGE 54
<PAGE> 58

last three (3) years, always has been December 31.

DEBT POSITION

DEBTS OWED TO THE ACQUIRED GROUP

4.1 There are no debts owing to the Acquired Group other than:

discharged prior to Closing; and

(ii) other trade debts incurred in the ordinary and
usual course of business.

DEBTS OWED BY THE ACQUIRED GROUP

2.1 No member of the Acquired Group will be subject to any tax
liability on account of any transaction or event occurring or deemed to occur
on or at any time before Closing, nor to any tax liability arising after
Closing owing to an adjustment or change imposed by any tax authority to the
treatment for taxation of any transaction or event occurring or deemed to occur
on or at any time before Closing otherwise than by reason of a voluntary act or
omission of any member of the Acquired Group which is not in the ordinary
course of its business and which is not fully provided for in the Closing
Accounts. No relief taken into account in computing or eliminating any
provision for deferred tax in the Last Accounts has been or could be prejudiced
by any event occurring or occurred after the Last Accounts Date. All other
warranties relating to specific tax matters set out in this Schedule are made
without prejudice to the generality of this paragraph.

CONTINUING COMMITMENTS

2.2 So far as the Seller is aware, all sums payable under any
obligation incurred by any Group Company prior to Closing and which will

any investigation, audit or non-routine visit by any tax authority. So far as

investigation, audit or non-routine visit by any tax authority and there are no
facts which might cause such an investigation, audit or non-routine visit to be
instituted.

PAGE 76
<PAGE> 80

PENALTIES, INTEREST

2.5 Within the past six years, no Group Company nor any
director or officer of any Group Company (in his capacity as such) has paid or

they may become liable to pay to any tax authority, any penalty, fine,
surcharge or interest in respect of tax (including in respect of any failure to
make any return, give any notice or supply any information to any relevant tax
authority, or any failure to pay tax on the due date for payment).

CONSENTS, CLEARANCES

2.6 No transaction in respect of which any consent, clearance
or dispensation was required or sought from any tax authority has been entered

consent, clearance or dispensation fully and accurately disclosed all facts and
circumstances material to the giving of such consent or clearance. Any
transaction for which such consent, clearance or dispensation was obtained has
been carried out only in accordance with the terms of such consent, clearance
or dispensation and the application on which the consent, clearance or
dispensation was based and at a time when such consent, clearance or
dispensation was valid and effective. No facts or circumstances have arisen
since any such consent, clearance or dispensation was obtained which would
cause the consent, clearance or dispensation to become invalid or ineffective.

special arrangement (being an arrangement which is not based on relevant
legislation or any published practice) in relation to any Group Company's
affairs.

Group Company which have not, at the time of Closing, been exercised, to make

relief and any rights to make an appeal against an assessment to tax or an
application for postponement or deferral of the payment of any tax.

regulations.

and has at all times been resident for tax purposes in its country of

5.1 All transactions between any Group Companies, or between
any Group Company and any current or past member of the Retained Group have
been and are on fully arm's length terms. There are no circumstances which

terms on which any such transaction is treated as taking place, and no such
adjustment has been made or attempted in fact.

5.2 Without prejudice to the generality of the preceding
paragraph, no Group Company is or could be treated as thinly capitalised for
any tax purpose. There are no circumstances which could cause any tax
authority to deny relief for interest paid by any Group Company, and no such
relief has been denied in fact.

means value added tax or any similar sales or turnover tax of any relevant
jurisdiction, and "VAT legislation" means any relevant enactments in relation

including the terms of any agreement reached with any relevant tax authority,
and any concession referred to in the Disclosure Letter.

condition of making supplies for the purposes of VAT.

6.3 Since the Last Accounts Date all VAT, import duty and
other taxes or charges payable upon the importation of goods or services and

imported or owned by any Group Company have been paid in full.

8.4 Payment for breach of Warranty under this Warranty 8 shall
be made when a tax liability in respect of any financial year arises which
would not have arisen but for a deficiency in Recoverable Tax Losses in breach
of Warranty 8.1 or Warranty 8.2, as applicable, and the amount of such payment
shall be the amount of the tax liability arising which would not have arisen
but for such deficiency.

8.5 No payment shall be due owing to breach of Warranty in
Warranty 8.2 to the extent that it, together with the aggregate of payments (if

clauses 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 constitutes an entirely separate and independent
restriction and that the duration, extent and application of each restriction
are no greater than is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the
interests of the Buyer but that, if any such restriction shall be adjudged by
any court or authority of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable
but would be valid if part of the wording thereof were to be deleted and/or the

Seller or Akzo (as appropriate) a sum corresponding to the amount
recovered from the tax authority.

(b) For the purposes of clause 9.12(a) an assessment to tax shall be
deemed to be finally and conclusively determined when, in respect of
such assessment, a decision of a tax authority, a court or tribunal is
given from which either no appeal lies, or in respect of which no
appeal is made within the prescribed time limit.

(c) If the Seller or Akzo makes payment of any amount for breach of a
Warranty pursuant to clause 9.12(a), the Buyer or Cambrex shall, or
shall procure that the Company shall, act promptly and without
unreasonable delay in all or any correspondence, litigation or other
dealings which it has with any tax authority for the purposes of
obtaining a final and conclusive determination of the liability to tax
in respect of which the Seller or Akzo made such payment.

9.14 The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and Cambrex (or
if so directed by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Company) for any liability arising
in respect of, by reference to or in consequence of the transfer between the
date hereof and the Closing Date of the entire corporate capital of the Company
to the Seller by Nobel Industries Holding B.V., and Trimetal Finance S.A..

9.15 In the event of any conflict between the Warranties and any indemnity
in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the Indemnities) it is agreed
between the parties hereto that the terms of such indemnity shall prevail.

or Cambrex at the date hereof.

BUYER' S AND CAMBREX' RIGHTS

11.1 The Buyer and Cambrex may by written notice given to the Seller at any
time prior to Closing rescind this Agreement without liability on the part of
the Buyer or Cambrex if any fact, matter or event (whether existing or
occurring on or before the date of this Agreement or arising or occurring
afterwards) comes to the notice of the Buyer or Cambrex at any time prior to
Closing which constitutes a material breach by the Seller of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any breach of the pre-Closing undertakings in
clause 4).

11.2 Akzo and Cambrex agree that, in the event of:

Page No. 28
<PAGE> 32
(a) rescission by the Buyer and Cambrex of this Agreement under clauses

transfer of the Quotas, without liability on the part of the Buyer or Cambrex.
In the case of termination the Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith to achieve an equitable settlement on restitution having due and proper
regard to the positions of the parties at Closing.

12.1 The Buyer and Cambrex hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Seller and Akzo that, as at Closing:

claims for breach of clause 9.11 and of the warranties or indemnities given by
the Buyer and Cambrex in this clause 12 shall not exceed an amount equal to

such claims exceeds Italian Lire two hundred million (Lire

12.4 If the Seller or Akzo becomes aware that any claim has been made
against any member of the Retained Group by a third party after Closing which
is likely to result in the Seller or Akzo being entitled to make a claim
against the Buyer or Cambrex in respect of a breach of any warranty given by
the Buyer and Cambrex in this clause 12:-

(a) the Seller or Akzo shall give notice of such claim to the Buyer or
Cambrex as soon as is reasonably practicable and shall procure that
the Company shall give the Buyer or Cambrex all reasonable facilities
to investigate any such claim; the defence of which may, at the option
of the Buyer or Cambrex, be undertaken by either or both of the Buyer
or Cambrex, PROVIDED THAT:

(i) all costs involved in such defence shall be borne
entirely by the Buyer and/or Cambrex, as appropriate;

(ii) the Buyer and/or Cambrex shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Retained Group in respect of any actual
or potential liability of the Retained Group arising

12.5 Neither the Buyer nor Cambrex shall be liable to the Seller and/or
Akzo in respect of any warranty of the Buyer or Cambrex in this Agreement to
the extent that either of them can demonstrate that the fact or circumstance

ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITIES

GENERAL INDEMNITY

13.1(a) The Seller undertakes and agrees (without limiting any other rights of
the Indemnified Parties in any way, including rights to damages in
respect of a claim for the breach of any term of this Agreement) to
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and Cambrex (or, if so directed
by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Company) from and against all Costs
howsoever arising relating to any Environmental Matter in relation to
the Properties or the Company including, without prejudice to the
generality of the above, any requirement pursuant to Applicable Laws
which may be imposed on the Company to instal a storm water
containment facility and the absence of a permit for the discharge of
liquid effluent from the Properties. For the avoidance of doubt, this
clause 13.1(a) shall not apply to:

(i) Remedial Action Programme Costs (which are dealt with under
clauses 13.2 and 13.3 below); and

(ii) other Costs to the extent that they arise out of the
ownership, use, handling, control or operation by the
Indemnified Parties of the Properties or the businesses of the
Company after Closing.

Page No. 31
<PAGE> 35
(b) To the extent that claims under this clause 13.1 relate to harm
sustained by or on the Properties, the Seller's liability shall be
subject to the Cap (as provided for in clause 13.2 below) and the
Seller shall only be liable if the costs relating to such claim are
incurred within the period of ten (10) years after the Closing Date or
within such longer period as the parties, acting reasonably, may
agree. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that claims under
this clause 13.1 relate to harm sustained or other Environmental
Matter arising outside the Properties, the Seller shall be liable
without limit as to time or amount.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, Costs which would be Remedial Action
Programme Costs if they had been incurred within the relevant period
of time applicable to such Costs, shall not be recoverable from the
Seller under this clause 13.1 but shall only be recoverable, if at
all, under clauses 13.2 or 13.3 as appropriate.

REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAMME COST SHARING

13.2 Subject to clause 13.4, all Remedial Action Programme Costs which are
attributable wholly to Existing Conditions shall be borne ninety per cent.
(90%) by the Seller on the one hand and ten per cent. (10%) by the relevant
Indemnified Party on the other hand. Subject to clause 10.2(a), the aggregate
of the Costs to be borne by the Seller under this clause 13.2 and clause 13.3
shall not exceed the Italian Lire equivalent of ten million Dutch Guilders (NLG
10,000,000) calculated on the Closing Exchange Rate basis (the CAP). The
Seller shall reimburse the Buyer and Cambrex (or, if so directed by the Buyer
or Cambrex, the Company) for all sums due under this clause within twenty-one
(21) days of receiving a written demand to do so with documentary evidence of
the Costs incurred and paid.

13.3 Remedial Action Programme Costs which are directly or indirectly
attributable:

(a) partly to Existing Conditions; and

(b) partly to the ownership, use, handling, control or operation of the
Properties by the Buyer or the Company after Closing,

shall be fairly apportioned between the relevant Indemnified Party and the
Seller as agreed between them or, failing such agreement, as shall be
determined by arbitrators pursuant to clause 28.3, taking into account only the
provisions of clause 13.2, the extent to which the Costs in question are
attributable to (a) and (b) above, and the steps taken (if any) by the
Indemnified Parties to avoid, limit, reduce or otherwise mitigate the risk of
incurring the relevant Remedial Action Programme Costs and their amount insofar
as such steps relate to Existing Conditions.

Page No. 32
<PAGE> 36
INSURANCE AND GRANTS

13.4(a) Where:

(i) Remedial Action Programme Costs; or

(ii) other Costs relating to harm sustained by or on the
Properties as referred to in clause 13.1(b) above,

are met, either wholly or partly, by insurance, governmental or other
grants directly relating to the Costs incurred, the sums payable by
the Seller in respect of such Costs shall be reduced in the following
way:

o the amount of such insurance (less the costs of recovery) or
grant shall be deducted from such Costs (the REDUCED COSTS);
and then

o the Reduced Costs shall be regarded as such Costs for the
purpose of calculating the Seller's liability.

(b) The Buyer shall use its, and shall procure after Closing that the
Company shall use its, reasonable endeavours to seek recovery under any
applicable policy of insurance or to obtain governmental or other grants where
these are available, to reduce the Seller's liability as provided for in this
clause 13.

INFORMATION SHARING AND COOPERATION

13.5 If the Buyer becomes aware of any matter which the Buyer reasonably
considers may give rise to a claim under these Environmental Indemnities, the
Buyer shall as soon as reasonably practicable give the Seller written notice
containing details (where possible) of the matter, including any proposed
Remedial Action Programme and including the Buyer's estimate (on a without
prejudice basis) of the cost of such action. The Buyer shall use and shall
cause the Company to use its reasonable endeavours to minimise the Remedial
Action Programme Costs and any disruptive effect of such action on the business
of the Buyer and the Company. The Buyer and the Seller shall engage in a
process of prompt, mutual information exchange and consultation concerning the
proposed responses to such matter, such exchanges and consultations to include,
where appropriate, but not be limited to the following:

(i) any communications of any nature concerning such matter;

(ii) identification and employment of legal and technical experts;

(iii) design and implementation of response activities;

(iv) negotiations with governmental entities and/or potential third party
claimants; and

Page No. 33
<PAGE> 37
(v) the Seller's consent to the use of expertise internal to the Buyer or
the Company, the Seller's consent to the use of such expertise not to
be unreasonably withheld.

Nothing in this clause 13.5 shall prevent or restrict the Buyer or the Company
from taking any action without complying with this clause 13.5 if the Buyer or
the Company reasonably believes that the taking of that action is urgently
necessary to avoid, limit, reduce or otherwise mitigate the risk of incurring
Costs which would give rise to a claim or claims against the Seller under these
Environmental Indemnities. However, if reasonably possible, such action shall
only be taken by the Buyer in consultation in good faith with the Seller.

PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES IN RELATION TO THE
ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITIES IN THE EVENT OF SUBSEQUENT SALES OF THE SHARES OR THE
PROPERTIES

13.6(a) If the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers the whole of
the Shares or the Properties to a third party, the Buyer shall be entitled to
assign to that third party the benefits contained in clauses 13.2 and 13.3 or
either of them (the ability to require the Seller to bear a proportion of
Remedial Action Programme Costs) and the benefit of this clause 13.6(a),
subject to (to the extent permissible by the relevant law governing the said
sale or transfer) the provisions of clauses 10.7, 13.4 and 13.5. The Buyer
shall consult with the Seller before exercising its right to assign under this
clause 13.6(a).

13.6(b) If the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers part of the
Shares or the Properties to a third party, the provisions of clause 13.6(a)
shall apply but the Cap (which applies to the benefits contained in clauses
13.2 and 13.3 by virtue of clause 13.2) shall be reduced, in relation to that
part of the Shares or the Properties which are sold or transferred, to the
proportion that the said part bears to the whole of the Shares or the
Properties as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the Cap, insofar as
it applies to the whole of the Shares or the Properties, shall not be reduced
below the amount specified in clause 13.2 as a result of any sale or transfer
of either the whole or part of the Shares or the Properties.

13.6(c) If:

(i) the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers the
whole or part of the Shares or the Properties to a third
party; and

(ii) the said third party is able to and does recover from the
Seller sums in respect of Remedial Action Programme Costs over
and above those which would have been payable by the Seller to
the Buyer (or to another Indemnified Party) had the said sale
or transfer to the third party not taken place (the EXCESS
COSTS);

Page No. 34
<PAGE> 38
the Buyer undertakes and agrees to indemnify the Seller and Akzo in respect of
the Excess Costs.

13.6(d) If the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers the whole or
part of the Shares or the Properties to a third party and the said third party
is able to and does recover from the Buyer or from another Indemnified Party
Costs which would have been recoverable by an Indemnified Party from the Seller
under the Environmental Indemnities had such sale or transfer not taken place,
the Seller undertakes and agrees to indemnify the Buyer and Cambrex (or, if so
directed by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Company) in respect of such Costs.

13.6(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of clauses 13.6(b), 13.6(c)
and 13.6(d) above are intended to place the parties to this Agreement, in the
event that the Buyer, after Closing, sells or otherwise transfers the Shares or
the Properties (or a part thereof) to a third party, in the same position with
regard to the Environmental Indemnities as they would have been had such sale
or transfer not taken place. If necessary in order to achieve this result, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to reach whatever supplemental
agreements, if any, is required.

COVENANT

14. No action to investigate the possibility or extent of contamination or
to treat such contamination not required by the Applicable Laws shall be taken
by the Buyer or the Company if, in the reasonable opinion of the Buyer or the
Company, such action is likely to lead to the imposition of a legal requirement
to carry out any environmental remedial work for which the Seller may have any
liability under this Agreement unless such investigation or treatment is a
necessary part or consequence of carrying out other actions in the normal
course of business. In carrying out any action which may lead to the
imposition of a legal requirement as aforesaid, the Buyer shall, and shall
procure that the Company shall, make reasonable efforts to minimise the amount
of any liability on the Seller and shall notify the Seller of any action which
the Buyer or the Company reasonably believes is likely to lead to the
imposition of such liability.

PENSION SCHEMES

15.1 All future liabilities of the Company for contributions to pension
schemes shall be for the account of the Company with effect from Closing.

15.2 The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and Cambrex (or
if, so directed by the Buyer or Cambrex, the Company) for any liability for
provision of pension benefits (including contributions to any relevant state
pension schemes) to any employee of the Company accrued under Italian GAAP up
to the Closing Date to the extent that liability therefor exceeds by more than
five per cent (5%) the provision made in the Last Accounts.

Page No. 35
<PAGE> 39
GROSSING UP

16. If any tax authority brings into charge to tax any sum paid by the
Seller or Akzo hereunder (including any circumstances where any relief is
available in respect of such charge to tax), then the Seller or Akzo shall pay
such additional amount as shall be required to ensure that the total amount
paid, less the tax chargeable on such amount (or that would be so chargeable
but for such relief), is equal to the amount that would otherwise be payable
hereunder PROVIDED THAT, but without prejudice to the foregoing, any sum paid
by the Seller or Akzo in respect of a Cost suffered or incurred by an
Indemnified Party shall be reduced to the extent that such Indemnified Party
benefits from a tax deduction or allowance in relation to such Cost.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND DEED OF TRANSFER

17.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties in connection with the sale and purchase of the Quotas.
None of the parties to this Agreement has entered into this Agreement in
reliance upon any representation, warranty or undertaking which is not set out
or referred to in this Agreement.

17.2 The parties expressly recognise that the Deed of Transfer does not
intend to supersede, alter or modify in any way this Agreement and that the
same will be executed by the parties in order to comply with the provisions of
Italian law N. 310 of 1993.

VARIATION

18. No variation of this Agreement (or of any of the documents referred to
herein) shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by or on behalf of
each of the parties hereto. The expression "variation" shall include any
variation, supplement, deletion or replacement however effected.

ASSIGNMENT

19. Subject to clause 13.6, none of the parties to this Agreement shall be
entitled to assign the benefit of any provision of this Agreement without the
prior written approval of the other parties, except for any assignment, in the
case of the Seller to a member of the Retained Group, or, in the case of
Cambrex or the Buyer, to another Subsidiary of Cambrex.

ANNOUNCEMENTS

20. No announcement or circular in connection with the existence or the
subject matter of this Agreement shall be made or issued by or on behalf of the

Page No. 36

Seller or the Buyer or any other member of the Retained Group or Cambrex and/or
its Subsidiaries without the prior written approval of the Buyer or the Seller
as applicable during any period prior to or within nine (9) months after
Closing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This shall
not affect any announcement or circular required by law or the rules of any

SCHEDULE 3

CLOSING ACCOUNTS

1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The Closing Accounts shall:

(a) be prepared as at the Closing Date;

(b) state the assets and liabilities of the Company;

(c) (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Schedule) be
prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting
principles in Italy (as drawn up by the National Counsil of Dottori
Commercialisti) and with generally accepted financial reporting
standards in Italy and on a basis consistent with that applied in the
preparation of the Balance Sheet and, where relevant, consistent with
the following guidelines which have been in use by the Company for the
calculation of balances in key working capital accounts:

A. Stocks (Inventory)

(i) All quantities on hand to be confirmed by physical count on
the Closing Date of all items, whether saleable or not. Both
parties have the right to observe the count to ensure it is
conducted satisfactorily.

(ii) The value of the stocks at Standard will be determined by
multiplying the quantity counted by the Standard Cost.

(iii) If there have been manufacturing variances from Standard, the
value in (ii) above will be adjusted to include that portion
of such variances to the quantities on hand at Closing Date.

(iv) From the list of material identified in the physical count the
value of the following items will be deducted from the value
calculated in (iii):

(aa) any item not meeting specifications or unsaleable or
unusable for any other reason;

(bb) any item manufactured more than one year prior to the
Closing Date;

(cc) any quantity of any item in excess of sales in the
prior twelve months. An exception to this would be
an item offered for sale for the first time in the
last twelve months,

Page No. 72
<PAGE> 76
in which case the basis will be the forecasted sale 
in the next twelve months.

(v) If material identified in (iv) cannot be reworked in the plant
at reasonable cost in less than one year, a reserve will be
booked for the disposal of the material.

B. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES

Accounts Receivable will represent all accounts due from customers for
goods or services rendered on the last day of the month prior to the
Closing Date. This amount will be reduced by:

(i) any amounts due from any customer in bankruptcy or in
liquidation or otherwise not able to pay;

(ii) any amount for which an agreement has been made to issue a
credit for any reason;

(iii) any amount more than 60 days past due date, except for amounts
due from Sales Companies; and

(iv) any payments received between the last day of the month prior
to the Closing Date and the Closing Date in payment of any of
the accounts referred to above.

This amount shall be increased by:

(aa) all invoices issued since the first day of the month of the
Closing Date for which payment has not been received; and

(bb) the sales value of any goods or services rendered since the
first day of the month of the Closing Date through to the
Closing Date which have not been included in (aa) above.

C. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Accounts Payable will include all amounts for goods or services which
have been received and invoices received from a supplier of the goods
or services less any amount for which the supplier has agreed to allow
a credit as of the Closing Date.

(d) be prepared in the format set out in paragraph 2 below;

(e) not re-appraise the value of any of the assets of the Company as a
result of the change in ownership of the quota capital of the Company
(or any changes in the business of the Company since the Closing Date
following such change in ownership).
