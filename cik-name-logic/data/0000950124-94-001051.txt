ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS - CLOSURE OF SPRINGFIELD, OREGON MANUFACTURING OPERATION

Morgan Products Ltd. will close its Springfield, Oregon fir door
manufacturing operation and consolidate its production into its Lexington,
North Carolina and Oshkosh, Wisconsin facilities. The company will also close
its Weed, California veneer facility although its existing door assembly and
warehouse operations in Weed will be continued. The closing of the Springfield
and Weed facilities are done pursuant to the production rationalization plan
that was approved by the Board of Directors on May 18, 1994.

The Company anticipates a one-time charge to pre-tax income in the
range of $11 million to $13 million to cover the costs of closing the two
operations and provide for other cost reduction and consolidation within Morgan
Products. Once implemented, the restructuring plan is expected to
significantly enhance profitability.

In addition, Arthur L. Knight, Jr., President and Chief Executive
Officer disclosed that he would not seek renewal of his employment contract
when it expires later this year. He will remain an active member of the Board
and will work closely on an orderly transition to the next Chief Executive
Officer.

The Company also has signed a letter of intent with Barclay's Business
Credit for a new three year credit agreement reflecting the restructuring plan.
The new agreement, which is anticipated to be finalized by July 30, 1994, is
expected to assure the Company adequate capital over the next three years as it
moves to expand its core business.

business unit.

Arthur L. Knight, Jr., President & Chief Executive Officer, said the Board also
approved a production rationalization plan that, when implemented, will result
in some further restructuring and consolidating of the Morgan Manufacturing
Business Unit that will significantly enhance its profitability. "We will be

MORGAN PRODUCTS LTD.
TO CONSOLIDATE OPERATIONS

Lincolnshire, Illinois, May 20, 1994 - - Following the May 18, 1994
announcement that it was retaining its manufacturing unit, Morgan Products Ltd.
today announced that it was taking a one-time charge in connection with a
restructuring and consolidation plan that is expected to significantly enhance
its profitability.

According to Arthur L. Knight, Jr., President & Chief Executive Officer, the
company will close its Springfield, Oregon fir door manufacturing operation and
consolidate its production into its Lexington, North Carolina and Oshkosh,
Wisconsin facilities. Morgan will also close its Weed, California veneer
facility. Its existing door assembly and warehouse operations in Weed will be
continued.

The Company anticipates a one-time charge in the second quarter to net income
in the range of $11 million to $13 million to cover the cost of closing the
Springfield plant and the Weed veneer operation and provide for other cost
reduction and consolidation within Morgan Products.

"Earnings from our manufacturing operations have been adversely impacted by too
much industry capacity," Knight said. "Wood prices, which have a direct
effect on product costs and product demand, have risen dramatically and
continue to be highly volatile. In addition, the wood stile and rail door
industry has significant excess capacity. While we expect market improvement
from higher-end housing and the remodeling markets, we believe these actions
will allow us to maximize profitability," Knight continued.

Knight said the Company was confident it could continue to service its existing
customers from its other manufacturing facilities. He said the Company would
continue to assemble doors and ship products to West-Coast markets from its
Weed, California plant.

Earlier this week the Company announced that it had received proposals from its
bank group that would provide the Company with financing over the next three
years, and that it expected to reach a final agreement by July 30, 1994.
