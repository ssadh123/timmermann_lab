Item 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
(1)

(a) Previous independent accountants

(i) On August 16, 1994, Best Buy Co., Inc. (the "Registrant")
dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP as its independent
accountants.

(ii) The reports of Deloitte & Touche LLP on the financial
statements for the past two fiscal years contained no
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principle.

(iii) The Registrant's Audit Committee participated in and
approved the decision to change independent accountants.

(iv) In connection with its audits for the two most recent fiscal
years and through August 16, 1994, there have been no
disagreements with Deloitte & Touche LLP on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of
Deloitte & Touche LLP would have caused them to make
reference thereto in their report on the financial
statements for such years.

(v) During the two most recent fiscal years and through August
16, 1994, there have been no reportable events (as defined
in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)).

(vi) The Registrant requested that Deloitte & Touche LLP furnish
it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not
it agrees with the above statements. The Registrant
delivered a copy of this Form 8-K report to Deloitte &
Touche LLP on August 18, 1994. Attached hereto as Exhibit
16 is a copy of the letter of Deloitte & Touche LLP to the
SEC dated August 18, 1994.

independent accountants as of August 16, 1994. During
the two most recent fiscal years and through
August 16, 1994, the Registrant has not consulted with
Ernst & Young LLP on items which (1) were or should have
been subject to SAS 50 or (2) concerned the subject matter
of a disagreement or reportable event with the former
auditor (as described in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(2)).
