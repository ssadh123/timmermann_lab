ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

Los Angeles, December 5 -- Union Oil Company of California today 
announced a change in the company's accounting policy for recognizing the 
reduction in value of certain oil and gas producing properties. 
Under the new policy, the company will evaluate properties for impairment 
on a field-by-field basis, compared with the country-by-country basis 
previously in use. As a result of this change, Union Oil anticipates taking a 
charge of approximately $445 million pretax ($275 million aftertax) to earnings 
in the fourth quarter 1994. The charge reflects the write-down of certain 
oil and gas producing properties in the U.S. from which the estimated 
undiscounted future cash flows are less than the current net book value of 
the properties. 
The company also said it anticipates a write-down of $35 million
pretax ($22 million aftertax) for certain other properties.
The company said that the effect of the write-downs will be to reduce
its domestic depreciation expense by 13 percent, or about 55 cents per
barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), assuming current production levels. On a
worldwide basis, the company's depreciation expense will be reduced by
about nine percent, or 33 cents per BOE.
The company also said that it is reviewing its provisions for
environmental clean-up costs and anticipates taking additional charges in
the fourth quarter. Subject to this review, the company said that it
expects to add between $150 million and $250 million pretax ($93 million to
$155 million aftertax) to its provisions for environmental clean-up costs.
In addition, the company expects to record a $35 million pretax ($22
million aftertax) provision for pending litigation expenses, as well as a
previously announced $25 million pretax ($15 million aftertax) for costs
related to reductions in corporate staff.
The provisions announced today have been reviewed with Coopers &
Lybrand, the company's independent auditors. However, the final provisions
are subject to further review by the company and the auditors.
