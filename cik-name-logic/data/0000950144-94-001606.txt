ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

In connection with its program of acquiring financial institutions
in existing or adjacent markets, Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions") is
filing this Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Current Report") with respect to
certain aspects of its consummated and pending acquisitions for the 1994 fiscal
year.

During the first six months of 1994, Regions (i) acquired Guaranty
Bancorp, Inc. ("Guaranty"), located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributing 
approximately $187 million in assets, $136 million in loans, and $173 million 
in deposits to Regions' consolidated balance sheet, and (ii) consummated 
certain transactions with the Resolution Trust Corporation (the "RTC"), as a 
result of which Regions Bank of Florida, Regions' banking subsidiary in 
Florida, acquired four branch offices in Panama City, Florida, and First 
Alabama Bank, Regions' banking subsidiary in Alabama, acquired one branch 
office in each of Brewton and Atmore, Alabama, with combined deposits in the 
six offices of approximately $50 million.

Since June 30, 1994, Regions has completed (i) the acquisitions of 
First Fayette Bancshares, Inc. ("First Fayette"), located in Fayette, Alabama,
and BNR Bancshares, Inc. ("BNR"), located in New Roads, Louisiana, certain 
aspects of which transactions are set forth in the following table and (ii) the
RTC transactions described in the paragraph following the table (collectively
the acquisitions enumerated in (i) and (ii) are referred to as the "Recently
Completed Acquisitions").

at the BNR Effective Time was converted into 2.2239 shares of the

Houma, Louisiana, and Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, a Regions' banking 
subsidiary in Louisiana, acquired two branch offices in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, with combined deposits in the three offices of approximately $39
million.

In addition, as of the date of this Current Report, Regions has
pending three additional acquisitions in Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana,

$24 million acquired in an RTC transaction consummated subsequent to 
June 30, 1994 (together with Regions' RTC transactions, the "RTC 
Transactions").

(2) Calculated as of the date of announcement of such transactions.

(3) At the effective time of the merger of ABI into Regions (the "ABI 
Effective Time"), each share of ABI common stock issued and outstanding
at the ABI Effective Time, with certain exceptions, will be converted 
into 2.4445 shares of Regions Common Stock.

(4) At the effective time of the merger of First Community Bancshares, Inc.
("First Community") into Regions (the "First Community Effective Time"),
each share of First Community common stock issued and outstanding at the
First Community Effective Time, with certain exceptions, will be
converted into .95 of a share of Regions Common Stock.

(5) At the effective time of the merger of Union Bank & Trust Company
("Union") with Regions (the "Union Effective Time"), each share of Union
common stock issued and outstanding at the Union Effective Time will be
converted into that number of shares of Regions Common Stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (i) $16.53 by (ii) the average of the
daily closing sales prices of Regions Common Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market (as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if not
reported thereby, another authoritative source chosen by Regions) for
the 10 consecutive full trading days in which such shares are traded on
the Nasdaq National Market ending at the close of trading on the fifth
trading day preceding the Union Effective Time.

If the Recently Completed Acquisitions and all of the Pending 
Acquisitions (collectively referred to as "All Other Acquisitions") had been
consummated on June 30, 1994, based on June 30, 1994 pro forma financial
information, Regions' total consolidated assets would have increased by
approximately $1.2 billion to approximately $12.0 billion; its total
consolidated deposits would have increased by approximately $951 million to
approximately $9.7 billion; and its total consolidated stockholders' equity
would have increased by approximately $29 million to approximately $934
million.

Consummation of the Pending Acquisitions is subject to the
approval of certain regulatory agencies and of the stockholders of the
institutions to be acquired and to the effectiveness of the registration
statements filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Moreover, the closing of each transaction is subject to various contractual
conditions precedent. No assurance can be given that the conditions precedent
to consummating the Pending Acquisitions will be satisfied in a manner that
will result in the consummation of all of the Pending Acquisitions.

In connection with the acquisitions of ABI and Union, Regions has
announced that it may purchase, in the open market, an equivalent number of 
some or all of the shares of Regions Common Stock to be issued in such 
transactions. As a result of the ABI and Union transactions, Regions 
anticipates that it may purchase in the open market as much as approximately 
$126 million of Regions Common Stock. The timing and amount of such possible 
purchases will be determined based on Regions Common Stock price, capital 
needs, and other factors. As of September 6, 1994, Regions had purchased
approximately $43.2 million of Regions Common Stock pursuant to this repurchase
program.

As part of its ongoing business strategy, Regions continually
evaluates business combination opportunities and frequently conducts due
diligence activities in connection with possible business combinations. As a
result, business combination discussions and, in some cases, negotiations
frequently take place, and future business combinations involving cash, debt,
or equity securities can be expected. Any future business combination or
series of business combinations that Regions might undertake may be material,
in terms of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, to Regions'

- 4 -
<PAGE> 5

financial condition. Recent business combinations in the banking industry
typically have involved the payment of a premium over book and market values.
This practice could result in dilution of book value and net income per share
for the acquirer.

Included as an exhibit to this Current Report, and incorporated
herein by reference, is certain unaudited pro forma financial information of
Regions as of June 30, 1994, prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X, 
giving effect to the above-discussed acquisitions.

Regions Financial Corporation
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Condition

a) Upon consummation of the merger with BNR, each share of BNR common
stock was converted into 2.2239 shares of Regions Common Stock, resulting in
the issuance of 725,477 shares of Regions Common Stock. The BNR transaction 
was accounted for as a pooling of interests, therefore the effect upon 
stockholders' equity was to increase Regions stockholders' equity by the total
equity of BNR. A reclassification from common stock to surplus resulted from
the issuance of the shares.

b) Upon consummation of the merger with First Community, each share of
First Community will be converted into 0.95 of a share of Regions Common Stock.
The First Community transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests, therefore the effect upon stockholders' equity will be to increase
Regions stockholders' equity by the total equity of First Community. The
unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared assuming that
Regions will issue approximately 664,914 shares of Regions Common Stock for all
the outstanding shares of First Community common stock. A reclassification from
common stock to surplus results from the issuance of the shares.

c) To reflect the purchase of all outstanding shares of First Fayette for
$17,000,000 in cash and notes.

d) To reflect the purchase of 1,668,387 shares of treasury stock at $36.00 per
share to effect the ABI transaction.

e) To reflect the elimination of ABI's capital accounts in accordance with
purchase accounting, and corresponding exchange of 1,784,387 shares of Regions
Common Stock for all the outstanding shares of ABI common stock, assuming a 
market price of $36.00 per share for Regions Common Stock. The Regions Common 
Stock exchanged is reflected as being issued from treasury stock.

f) To reflect the purchase of 1,805,556 shares of treasury stock at $36.00
per share to effect the Union transaction.

g) To reflect the elimination of Union's capital accounts in accordance with
purchase accounting, and corresponding exchange of 1,805,556 shares of Regions
Common Stock for all the outstanding shares of Union common stock, assuming a 
market price of $36.00 per share for Regions Common Stock. The Regions Common 
Stock exchanged is reflected as being issued from treasury stock.
