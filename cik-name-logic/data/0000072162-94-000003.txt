FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NL ANNOUNCES RECEIPT OF TENTATIVE TAX REFUND

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- May 31, 1994 -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE:NL) announced that 
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kronos International, Inc., has received from the
German tax authorities approximately DM 170 million ($103 million), including
interest, as a partial payment on a tentative basis, of the Company's claims for
income tax refunds. The Company expects to apply substantially all of the 
refund to reduce the outstanding amount of its DM revolving credit facility. As
a result of this reduction in its outstanding indebtedness, the Company's annual
interest costs should be reduced by approximately DM 10 million ($6 million) at
current interest rates.

As previously reported, certain of the Company's German income tax returns in
Germany are being examined. In April 1994, the German tax authorities withdrew
certain tax claims and agreed to remit the Company's claims for refunds while
the examination of its returns continues, and in return the Company granted a
lien on certain German assets. The timing and amount of future assessments
proposing additional tax deficiencies remain uncertain while the examination
continues. Other than a reduction in the Company's interest expense, receipt of
this tentative refund should not have a significant effect on income and the
Company believes that it has adequately provided accruals for additional income
taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from the
examination of its German tax returns. 

NL Industries, Inc. is a major international producer of titanium dioxide
pigments and specialty chemicals.
