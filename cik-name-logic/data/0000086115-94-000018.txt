Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
Texas Instruments Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of MAXIMIS
(formerly a business unit of Texas Instruments Incorporated) at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 and September 30, 1994, and the
related statements of operations and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 and the nine
months ended September 30, 1994. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the management of Texas Instruments
Incorporated. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

As discussed in Note 1, Premier Solutions Ltd. acquired certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities of MAXIMIS as of
September 30, 1994. Prior to September 30, 1994, MAXIMIS was a
part of Texas Instruments Incorporated and, as such, had no
separate legal status or existence. Transactions with Texas
Instruments Incorporated are described in Note 2.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of MAXIMIS at December 31, 1993, 1992 and September
30, 1994, and the results of its operations and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993
and the nine months ended September 30, 1994, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 1994

1. Description of Business and Subsequent Event

MAXIMIS (the Business) was formerly a business unit of Texas
Instruments Incorporated (the Parent) which marketed an
investment management information system to leading insurance
companies and state pension funds for a wide range of asset
management and investment accounting applications. The Business
is economically dependent on four primary customers which
account for substantially all revenues earned. As of September
30, 1994, Premier Solutions Ltd. acquired certain assets and
assumed certain liabilities of the Business as defined in the
purchase agreement.

2. Significant Accounting Policies

Allocation of Expenses

The Parent provides various administrative services to the
Business including marketing, data processing and personnel
services. The Parent charged these expenses and all other
central operating costs, first on the basis of direct usage
when identifiable, with the remainder allocated among the
Parent's division entities on the basis of their respective
revenues, headcount, or level of effort. Rent expense was
allocated to the Business based on square footage used. In the
opinion of management, these methods of allocation are
reasonable.

Capitalized Software

The Business capitalizes certain software development costs.
Amounts capitalized are amortized by the straight-line method
over three years.

Equipment

Equipment is stated at cost and primarily consists of personal
computers. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful
life of five years using the 150 percent declining-balance
method.

Goodwill

Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the net assets of the business acquired and is
amortized by the straight-line method over five years.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Business recognizes revenue from sales of software licenses
upon delivery of the software product unless the Business has
significant related obligations remaining. Revenue is not
recognized until such obligations have been completed or are no
longer significant. Service revenue is recognized upon
performance. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and
recognized over the terms of the related contracts.

Cash

The Business's cash and short-term borrowing activities have
been included in the Parent's cash management system, and the
Business's cash receipts and disbursements were combined with
other Parent cash transactions and balances. Accordingly, no
cash balances or short-term borrowings are presented in the
accompanying balance sheet. The net cash transfers between the
Business and the Parent appear in the accompanying statement of
cash flows as "Net transfers from parent" and are included in
the "Divisional account" in the accompanying balance sheet.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Business received an allocation from the Parent for the
pension and postretirement benefits of Business employees. The
Parent's actuarial valuation does not provide an allocation of
the information relevant to the Business; thus, the related
expense and liabilities have been determined for the Business
based on headcount.

3. Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs

In connection with the Parent's decision in 1994 to divest the Business, 
capitalized software of $12,149 was written off
in 1994. The write-off is reflected on the face of the Statement of Operations.

Research and development expense $742 $140 $186 $393 $--

</TABLE>

5. Income Taxes

The Business accounts for income taxes under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109. Although the Business
was included in the Parent's consolidated tax return, the
income taxes for the purposes of these financial statements
have been prepared on a separate return basis. Accordingly, the
net operating loss carryforwards and tax deductible items
included below have already been utilized by the Parent. Under
a separate return computation, there is no current provision
for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. The deferred income
tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the related description of the acquisition of the Maximis
Software Business Unit (Maximis) of Texas Instruments Incorporated by
Premier Solutions, Ltd. (Premier) , a 94% owned subsidiary of the
Registrant included in the Registrant's Form 8-K dated October 17, 1994.

The Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
December 31, 1993 reflects the results of operations for the Registrant as
if the acquisition of Maximis was consummated January 1, 1993. The Pro Forma
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September
30, 1994 reflects the results of operations for the Registrant as if the
acquisition of Maximis was consummated January 1, 1994. The Pro Forma
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 1994 assumes the acquisition
was consummated on September 30, 1994. Pro forma adjustments reflect the
elimination of certain assets not purchased and the elimination of
depreciation and amortization on certain of those assets, the elimination 
of certain liabilities not assumed, the elimination of Maximis' equity 
and the tax effect of pro forma adjustments.

These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only
and do not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the
acquisition been made at January 1, 1993 or January 1, 1994, nor are they
indicative of results which may occur in the future.
