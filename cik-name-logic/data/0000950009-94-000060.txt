FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
---------------------

SOUTHFIELD, Mich., April 19 -- Chrysler Financial Corporation (CFC)
today reported 1994 first quarter net earnings of $47 million, compared to
earnings of $37 million, before the effect of accounting changes, in
the first quarter of 1993. 
John P. Tierney, Chairman of CFC, said the 1994 first quarter net
earnings increase was due to a larger automotive financing portfolio.
At March 31, 1994, CFC was managing $29.8 billion in receivables, up
$2.5 billion from a year ago. The increase in receivables managed was
caused by a higher volume of automotive financing. The company's total
assets at March 31, 1994, were $15.4 billion, down $1.0 billion from a year
ago. 
Chrysler Credit, CFC's automotive finance subsidiary, had receivables
managed of $26.7 billion at March 31, 1994, compared to $23.6 billion a
year ago.
During the first quarter of 1994, Chrysler Credit's automotive
financing volume was 137,000 new passenger cars, trucks and minivans
representing 24 percent of Chrysler's U.S. retail deliveries, compared to
111,000 vehicles, or 23 percent in the first quarter of 1993. 
In the first quarter of 1994, Chrysler Credit also financed at
wholesale 423,000 vehicles representing 71 percent of Chrysler's U.S.
factory shipments, compared to 377,000 vehicles or 71 percent in the first
quarter of 1993.

CFC's nonautomotive operations, consisting of Chrysler Capital, a
commercial leasing and lending unit, and Chrysler First Business Credit, a
small business loan operation, were managing $3.1 billion in receivables at
March 31, 1994. A year ago, the company's nonautomotive operations were
managing $3.7 billion in receivables.
Chrysler Insurance, the company's property, casualty and inventory
insurance subsidiary, had direct insurance premiums written of $37 million
during the first quarter of 1994, compared to $34 million for the same
period a year ago.
In 1994 first quarter capital markets activity, CFC received
net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of U.S. and Canadian
automotive receivables, issued $250 million of 5 5/8% notes due
in 1999, and sold $370 million of medium term notes.
During the first quarter, Duff & Phelps raised the company's
senior debt to BBB+ from BBB; the Canadian rating agency DBRS
raised Chrysler Credit Canada's commercial paper to R1 (low) from
R2 (mid), and raised senior debt to A (low) from BBB; and
Standard & Poors placed CFC's debt securities on rating watch
with positive implications. At the end of the first quarter, CFC
had commercial paper outstanding of $3.1 billion compared to $1.5
billion a year ago.
Shortly after the close of the quarter, CFC began the
process of negotiating the replacement of its major credit line
facilities with U.S. and foreign banks.

Gains or losses from the sale of retail receivables are recognized in

losses are generally provided during the period in which such
receivables are acquired. Since the allowance for credit losses is

receivable sales are not reduced for expected credit losses. 
Included in "Investment and other income" are gains before expected
credit losses totaling $28 million and $22 million for the three
months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The provision
for credit losses related to such sales amounted to $31 million, and
$29 million for the three months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993,

Credit Facilities

At March 31, 1994, the Company had credit facilities aggregating $5.2
billion, consisting of contractually committed U.S. credit lines of $4.7
billion expiring in August 1995, and $.5 billion of Canadian credit
lines expiring in December 1995. At March 31, 1994 the Company had no
borrowings outstanding under either of these credit facilities.

At March 31, 1994, the Company had automotive receivable sale agreements
totaling $2.9 billion, consisting of a $2.5 billion U.S. automotive
receivable sale agreement (of which $1.25 billion expires in September
1994 and $1.25 billion expires in September 1996), and a $.4 billion
Canadian receivable sale agreement which expires in December 1995. At
March 31, 1994, none of the Company's receivable sale agreements were
utilized. 
<PAGE>
Chrysler Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries

Note 3 - Debt (Continued)

In addition, up to $750 million of the total commitment under Chrysler's
revolving credit agreement dated June 30, 1993 can be made available to
the Company. As of March 31, 1994, no borrowings were outstanding under
this agreement.

The Company has contractual debt maturities of $4.2 billion during the
remainder of 1994 (including $3.1 billion of short-term notes), and $.6
billion in 1995.

Note 4 - Accounting Changes

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities." This new accounting standard specifies the
accounting and reporting requirements for changes in the fair values of
investments with readily determinable fair values. 

Under SFAS No. 115, debt and equity securities are categorized into one
of three categories: trading, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 
Trading securities and available-for-sale securities are recorded at
fair value. Changes in the fair value of trading securities are
included in earnings currently. Changes in the fair value of available-
for-sale securities are recorded as a separate component of
Shareholder's Investment until realized. Held-to-maturity securities
are carried at cost adjusted for amortized premium or discount. 

At March 31, 1994, the Company had investments in securities with an
aggregate carrying value of $383 million, consisting primarily of
commercial paper, governmental securities and corporate debt. At March
31, 1994, $348 million of these securities were categorized as
available-for-sale, while $35 million were categorized as held-to-
maturity. The adjustment of available-for-sale securities to market
value at January 1, 1994 resulted in a $6 million increase to
Shareholder's Investment.

At March 31, 1994, the outstanding debt securities held as investments
have contractual maturities as follows: $118 million due within one
year, $80 million due after one year through five years, $41 million due
after five years through ten years, and $97 million due after ten years.

Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company provides health and life insurance benefits to substantially
all of its U.S. and Canadian employees. Upon retirement from the
Company, employees may become eligible for continuation of these
benefits. However, benefits and eligibility rules may be modified
periodically. Prior to 1993, the expense recognized for these benefits
was based primarily on cash expenditures for the period. Effective
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("OPEB") which requires
the accrual of such benefits during the years the employees provide
services. 
<PAGE>
Chrysler Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries

Note 4 - Accounting Changes (Continued)

The adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in an after-tax charge of $29
million in 1993, which represented the immediate recognition of the OPEB
transition obligation of $45 million, partially offset by $16 million of
estimated tax benefits. 

The OPEB transition obligation is the aggregate amount that would have
been accrued in the years prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 106 had this
standard been in effect for those years. Implementation of SFAS No. 106
did not increase the Company's cash expenditures for postretirement
benefits. Recognition of on-going expenses under OPEB will not
materially affect the Company's results of operations.

Postemployment Benefits

During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" effective January 1,
1993. This statement requires the accrual of benefits provided to
former or inactive employees after employment but prior to retirement. 
Prior to 1993, the Company accrued for certain of these benefits at the
time an employee's active service ended or expensed the benefit on the
basis of cash expenditures. Adoption of this accounting standard
resulted in the recognition of an after-tax charge of $1 million for the
cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle for the quarter
ended March 31, 1993. Results for the quarter ended March 31, 1993 have
been restated accordingly. Adoption of SFAS No. 112 has not materially
increased the annual expense recognized for these benefits, and there is
no cash impact.

Impairment of a Loan

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," which
amends SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", by requiring
creditors to evaluate the collectibility of both contractual interest
and principal of receivables when evaluating the need for a loss
accrual. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 114 on or before January
1, 1995. The Company has not yet determined the effect of this new
pronouncement on its results of operations and financial position.

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures
to financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial
and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for
them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Financial Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for the year then
ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated January 18, 1994, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed 
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 is fairly presented, 
in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet 
from which it has been derived.
