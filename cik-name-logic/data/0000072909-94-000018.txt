Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

a. On December 13, 1994, management of Northern States Power Company 
informed Deloitte & Touch LLP of a plan to recommend a change in 
independent accountants for 1995 at the special meeting of the Audit 
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors on December 19, 1994.

b. At the special meetings on December 19, 1994, the Audit Committee 
of the Company's Board of Directors recommended, and the Board approved, 
the appointment of the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse LLP as 
independent accountants for the Registrant for 1995. The change 
in independent accountants is subject to ratification by the 
Company's shareholders at the Annual Meeting on May 3, 1995.

c. On December 20, 1994, Company management informed Deloitte & Touche LLP 
that the firm would no longer be engaged as independent accountants for 
the Registrant and its subsidiaries after the completion of audit work
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994.

and during subsequent interim periods through December 20, 1994,

of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, 
or auditing scope or procedures.

e. Deloitte & Touche LLP's reports on the Company's financial statements for
the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 1992 and 1993 
contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not 
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope. Their report for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 included a fourth paragraph 
which referred to changes in the Company's method of accounting 
for postretirement healthcare costs.

f. During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 1992 and 
1993, and during subsequent interim periods through December 20, 1994,
