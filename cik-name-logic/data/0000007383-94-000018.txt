Armco Inc. ("Armco") signed a letter of intent on July 15, 1994, to 
sell most of its interest in North American Stainless ("NAS"), a 50-percent 
joint venture with Acerinox S.A. of Spain ("Acerinox") that finishes chrome 
nickel flat-rolled stainless steel located in Carrollton, Kentucky. Under 
the terms of the letter of intent, Armco would sell 90% of its equity 
interest for $73 million to Acerinox and would retain a five percent 
ownership interest in the venture and would continue to supply NAS with 
chrome nickel stainless steel coils for a period after the sale. Armco said 
the sale is subject to various conditions, including the execution of a 
definitive agreement by the partners. Armco expects to record a gain of 
approximately $27 million on completion of the sale, which is expected to be 
in the third quarter of 1994.

Armco and Acerinox formed NAS in April of 1990 to produce 48-inch and 
60-inch wide commodity chrome nickel stainless sheet and strip for domestic 
steel service centers and other end users. NAS was completed in December 
1992 and began shipping to customers in mid-1993.
