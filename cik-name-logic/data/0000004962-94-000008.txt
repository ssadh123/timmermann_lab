Item 5. Other Events

On April 21, 1994, American Express Company issued the
following press release announcing first quarter 1994 earnings: 

NEW YORK, April 21, 1994 -- American Express Company today
reported first quarter income from continuing operations of $317
million, or $0.62 per share, compared with $268 million, or $0.53
per share a year ago, before a gain of $433 million from the sale
of First Data Corporation (FDC) stock last year. Including the
FDC gain, 1993 income from continuing operations was $701
million, or $1.41 per share. Including Lehman Brothers (Lehman),
which is reflected as a discontinued operation, and the year-ago
FDC gain, American Express' first quarter 1994 net income totaled
$353 million, or $0.69 per share, compared with $243 million, or
$0.48 per share a year ago. The Lehman results for both periods
include a number of items which are discussed later. As
previously announced, the Company expects to complete the
spin-off of Lehman in the second quarter.

Travel Related Services (TRS) reported first quarter net
income of $234 million, a 12 percent increase over last year's
net income of $209 million. During last year's first quarter,
TRS sold a portion of its insurance business and other
investments and recognized a charge on the defeasance of certain
high-coupon debt. These combined transactions resulted in net
after-tax gains of $15 million.

Net revenues increased 6 percent reflecting an increase in
worldwide billed business which stemmed from higher spending per
Cardmember and an increase in the number of Cards outstanding. 
This increase was partially offset by discount rate reductions
and a decrease in net Card fee revenues.

Excluding interest and the provision for losses, total
expenses increased 7 percent, primarily reflecting business
travel growth and investments in certain business initiatives.
These increases offset lower marketing and promotion expenses. 
However, it is expected that for the full year, marketing and
promotion expenses will be higher than last year.

IDS Financial Services (IDS) reported record first quarter
net income of $91 million, a 22 percent increase over last year's
net income of $74 million.

Revenue and earnings growth benefited primarily from an
increase in management fees and net investment income that
resulted from higher asset levels. Results also benefited from
wider investment margins compared to year-ago levels.

IDS reported record first quarter sales of annuities,
mutual funds, and life and related insurance products. Sales of
investment certificates increased from last year.

American Express Bank (AEB) reported first quarter net
income of $24 million, a 39 percent increase over last year's net
income of $17 million.

Results for the first quarter reflect growth in private
banking fee income, a lower provision for credit losses due to
improved credit quality and a lower effective tax rate. 
Increased expense levels reflected growth in revenues.

Total nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets
(in-substance foreclosures and assets acquired in loan
settlements) of $123 million decreased $9 million from December
31, 1993.

Lehman Brothers (Lehman) results are presented as
"discontinued operations" to reflect the previously announced
spin-off to shareholders, which is expected to be completed in
the second quarter.

Excluding the items presented in the chart below, the
businesses that now comprise Lehman reported income of $73
million, compared with $55 million a year ago.

* Implementation of SFAS No. 112 related to accounting for

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
Excluding the businesses sold in 1993, revenues, net of
interest expense, increased slightly over last year reflecting
strong customer flow, which was partially offset by less
favorable trading results. Excluding the businesses sold, total
non-interest expenses were down slightly.

After preferred dividend requirements, American Express'
share of Lehman's results was net income of $36 million, compared
with a net loss of $458 million last year.

Corporate and Other reported first quarter net expenses of
$32 million in both the 1994 and 1993 first quarters, before a
$433 million after-tax gain from the sale of FDC stock last year.

In March 1993, the Company's ownership interest in FDC was
reduced from 54 percent to 22 percent. Lower earnings from FDC
were offset by lower corporate expenses.

The 1994 first quarter includes income from the Company's
share of the Travelers Corporation (Travelers) revenue
participation, in accordance with an agreement related to the
1993 sale of the Shearson Lehman Brothers Division, as well as a
capital gain on the sale of Travelers preferred stock and
warrants which were acquired as part of the 1993 sale. These
gains were offset by the Company's costs associated with the
Lehman spin-off, certain business-building initiatives and the
termination of the Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 

The impact of SFAS No. 112 is insignificant to the
Company's continuing operations.

financial services company founded in 1850, is a world leader in
