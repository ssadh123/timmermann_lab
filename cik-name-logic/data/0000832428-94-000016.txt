ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On September 14, 1994 shareholders of Scripps Howard
Broadcasting Company ("SHB") approved a proposal to merge
("Merger Agreement") the company with its parent, The E.W.
Scripps Company ("EWS").

Prior to September 14, 1994 EWS owned 86% of the 10.3
million outstanding shares of SHB common stock.

Shareholders of SHB will receive 3.45 shares of EWS's Class
A Common Stock in a tax-free exchange for each SHB share
that EWS did not already own.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Certificate of Merger
was filed with the Secretary of State of Ohio on September
15, 1994, at which time the Merger became effective.

The acquisition of the 14% of SHB not already owned by EWS
will be accounted for as a purchase. Based upon the
September 15, 1994 closing price of $29.63 for EWS Class A
Common Stock, the acquisition was valued at $147 million.
