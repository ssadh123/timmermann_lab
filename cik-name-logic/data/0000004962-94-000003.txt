Item 5. Other events.

American Express Company (the "Company") filed an 8-K Report on January 24,
1994 which included, among other disclosures, a schedule addressing the pro-
forma impact of the Company's spin-off of the common stock of its subsidiary
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman Brothers"). A revised pro forma 
schedule filed herewith reflects certain changes described below, and 
supersedes the schedule in the 8-K Report filed on January 24. 

A. Under "Pro Forma Adjustments," the "Interest on Capital 
Infusion" assumed the reduction of interest on the pay-down of $1.25 billion 
of long-term debt at a 4% after-tax rate. The new schedule assumes the 
pay-down of $1.19 billion of short-term debt at a 2% after-tax rate, which 
reduces the interest benefit from $50 million after-tax to $25 million 
after-tax. In addition, the "Pro Forma Adjustments" now include a $12 
million after-tax interest charge representing (i) the interest allocated by 
Lehman Brothers to certain businesses sold, i.e., the retail and asset 
management businesses, as well as certain other assets related to such 
businesses ("SLBD") and Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Company ("SLHMC"), 
for the carrying costs of buildings, improvements and equipment and certain
acquisition related debt not directly eliminated by such sales, 
(ii) offset in part by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the 
utilization of the cash proceeds by Lehman Brothers from the sale of 
SLBD, SLHMC and The Boston Company, Inc. ("TBC") to reduce short term debt 
and term notes. Giving effect to these adjustments, Lehman Brothers 
pro forma net income to common shareholders for the twelve months 
ended December 31, 1993 changed from a $93 million loss to a $130
million loss.

B. In the "Preliminary 1993 selected statistical information," 
the Lehman Brothers pro forma income (described to exclude the gain 
on the sale of TBC, loss on the sale of SLBD, reserves for non-core 
businesses and net income of TBC/SLBD), has been reduced to reflect the 
$25 million change in interest benefit and $12 million interest charge 
described above, and $21 million of the $100 million 
non-core business reserves (reflected under "Income excluding items 
listed below (A)") that related to certain non-core partnership syndication 
activities in which Lehman Brothers is no longer actively engaged. 
Giving effect to all such adjustments, Lehman Brothers pro forma net 
income changed from $426 million to $368 million. The following table 
summarizes the adjustments discussed in this paragraph.
