INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 are not applicable and are omitted
from this Report.

Item 5. Other Events.

Reference is made to Part I, Item 1 "Business--Risks of
International Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993 and "Management's
Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition" in the Company's
1993 Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended March 31, 1994 and June 30, 1994 and the discussion
therein of the EU quota and licensing regulation and the Framework
Agreement. On September 2, 1994, the Company and the Hawaii Banana
Industry Association made a joint filing with the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act
of 1974, charging that the EU quota and licensing regime and the
Framework Agreement are unreasonable, discriminatory and a burden
and restriction on U.S. commerce. In the filing, the petitioners
request the U.S. government to initiate a formal investigation and
take all feasible action to achieve the termination of the
Framework Agreement and a restructuring of the EU banana regulatory
system. If the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative accepts the
petition for investigation (a decision it is required to make
within 45 days), investigation typically takes up to a year. If
satisfactory relief is not obtained, the U.S. government may, but
would not be obligated to, take retaliatory action against the EU
countries and Latin American countries named in the petition.
