ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

(a) On December 13, 1994, the registrant dismissed KMPG 
Peat Marwick LLP and engaged Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. to replace 
KPMG Peat Marwick LLP as the registrant's independent accountant 
after the completion of the current audit for the year ended 
December 31, 1994. The Audit Committee of the registrant's Board 
of Directors of First Maryland Bancorp approved the selection of 
Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. as the registrant's new accountant and 
the dismissal of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP. 

(b) During the two most recent fiscal years and interim 
periods through September 30, 1994, there were no disagreements 
with KPMG Peat Marwick LLP on any matter of accounting principles 
or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope 
or procedure or any reportable events.

(c) KPMG Peat Marwick LLP's report for the past two years 
contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not 
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting 
principles.

furnish it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it 
agrees with the above statements. A copy of KPMG Peat Marwick
LLP's letter to the SEC dated December 19, 1994 is filed as 
Exhibit 16 to the Form 8-K.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We were previously principal accountants for First Maryland Bancorp
and, under the date of February 10, 1994, we reported on the 
consolidated financial statements of First Maryland Bancorp and 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and for each of the years 
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. On December 13, 1994, 
our appointment as principal accountants was terminated after the 
completion of the audit for the year ended December 31, 1994. We have 
read First Maryland Bancorp's statements included under Item 4 of its 
Form 8-K dated December 13, 1994, and we agree with such statements.

Very truly yours,

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP
