No. 071000039, 231 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60697, on the date of
closing, which shall be April 7, 1994 (the "Closing" or the "Date of Closing").

PARAGRAPH 3. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT.

3. Conditions Precedent. Your obligation to purchase and pay for the
Notes to be purchased by you hereunder is subject to the satisfaction, on or
before the Date of Closing, of the following conditions:

3A. Certain Documents. You shall have received the following:

(i) The Notes to be purchased by you;

Directors of the Company approving this Agreement and the Notes, and
of all documents evidencing other necessary corporate action and
governmental approvals, if any, with respect to this Agreement and the
Notes;

(iii) A certificate of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of
the Company certifying the names and true signatures of the officers
of the Company authorized to sign this Agreement and the Notes and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder;

(iv) Certified copies of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the Date of
Closing; and

(v) A favorable opinion of Erik B. Carlson, Esq., General Counsel
of the Company, reasonably satisfactory to you and substantially in
the form of Exhibit B attached hereto and as to such other matters as
------- - 
you may reasonably request (and the Company hereby instructs its
counsel to deliver such opinion to you and acknowledges that you are
relying on such opinion).

3B. Opinion of Purchasers' Special Counsel. You shall have received
from Baker & Botts, L.L.P., who are acting as special counsel for you in
connection with this transaction, a favorable opinion reasonably satisfactory to
you as to: (i) the due incorporation, existence and good standing of the
Company; (ii) the due authorization by

-2-
<PAGE>

all requisite corporate action, execution and delivery and the validity, legally
binding character and enforceability of this Agreement and the Notes; (iii) the
absence of any requirement to register the Notes under the Securities Act; and
(iv) such other matters incident to the matters herein contemplated as you may
reasonably request, including the form of all papers and the validity of all
proceedings. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, to the extent
appropriate, upon the opinion referred to in Paragraph 3A. Such opinion shall
also state that, based upon such investigation and inquiry as is deemed relevant
and appropriate by such counsel, the opinion referred to in Paragraph 3A is
satisfactory in form and scope to such counsel and, while such investigation and
inquiry into the matters covered by such opinion (other than the matters
specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above) were not sufficient to enable such
counsel independently to render such opinion, nothing has come to the attention
of such counsel that has caused them to question the legal conclusions expressed
in the opinion referred to in Paragraph 3A and such counsel believe that you are
justified in relying on such opinion.

3C. Representations and Warranties; No Default. The representations
and warranties contained in Paragraph 8 shall be true on and as of the Date of
Closing, except to the extent of changes caused by the transactions herein
contemplated; there shall exist on the Date of Closing no Event of Default or
Default; and the Company shall have delivered to you an Officer's Certificate,
dated the Date of Closing, to both such effects.

3D. Purchase Permitted By Applicable Laws. The purchase of and
payment for the Notes to be purchased by you on the Date of Closing on the terms
and conditions herein provided (including the use of the proceeds of the Notes
by the Company) shall not violate any applicable law or governmental regulation
(including, without limitation, section 5 of the Securities Act or Regulation G,
T or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and shall not
subject you to any tax, penalty, liability or other adverse condition under or
pursuant to any applicable law or governmental regulation, and you shall have
received such certificates or other evidence as you may request to establish
compliance with this condition.

3E. Proceedings. All corporate and other proceedings taken or to be
taken in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and all documents
incident thereto shall be reasonably satisfactory in substance and form to you,
and you shall have received all such counterpart originals or certified or other
copies of such documents as you may reasonably request.

shall sell to each Purchaser the Note or Notes to be purchased by it at the
Closing and shall receive payment in full therefor.

Closing, approximately $40,000,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Notes to
the reduction of the Debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement; and
the Company shall have delivered to you an Officer's Certificate, dated the Date
of Closing, to such effect.

3H. Private Placement Number. The Company shall have obtained a
private placement number for the Notes from the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard
& Poor's Corporation (in cooperation with the Securities Valuation Office of the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners).

3I. Compliance With Outstanding Debt Limitations. The Company shall
have delivered to you an Officer's Certificate of an authorized financial
officer of the Company describing any instrument or agreement to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary
is bound that limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the
incurring of, indebtedness of the type to be evidenced by the Notes, together
with such evidence as you may reasonably request showing that, after giving
effect to the reduction of the Debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Agreement as contemplated by Paragraph 3G, the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Notes will not conflict
with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien on any
property owned by the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, or otherwise
violate, any agreement or instrument evidencing the indebtedness of the Company
or any Subsidiary or any agreement relating thereto.

PARAGRAPH 4. PREPAYMENTS.

4. Prepayments. The Notes shall be subject to prepayment only with
respect to the required prepayments specified in Paragraph 4A and also under the

full, the Company shall apply to the prepayment of the Notes, without premium,
the sum of $8,000,000 on April 15 in each of the years 1999 to 2002, inclusive,
and such principal amounts of the Notes, together with interest thereon to the
prepayment dates, shall become due and payable on such prepayment dates. Any
prepayment made by the Company pursuant to any other provision of this Paragraph
4 shall not reduce or otherwise affect its obligation to make any prepayment

<PAGE>

4B. Optional Prepayment of Notes With Yield-Maintenance Premium. The
Notes shall be subject to prepayment, in whole at any time or from time to time
in part (in integral multiples of $1,000,000), at the option of the Company, at
100% of the principal amount so prepaid plus interest thereon to the prepayment
date and the Yield-Maintenance Premium, if any, with respect to each Note. If

on the prepayment date in lieu of the Yield-Maintenance Premium with respect to
such Note; provided that the premium provided for in such designation shall have
-------- 
been offered to each holder of a Note and each such holder shall have at least
five Business Days to consider such premium prior to the prepayment date and
provided further that the availability of such premium shall not be conditional
- - -------- ------- 
upon or subject to any agreement on the part of any holder of a Note to waive or
amend any term or provision of this Agreement or the Notes.

4C. Notice of Optional Prepayment. The Company shall give the holder
of each Note irrevocable written notice of any prepayment pursuant to Paragraph
4B not less than 15 Business Days, or more than 60 Business Days, prior to the
prepayment date, specifying such prepayment date and the principal amount of the
Notes, and of the Notes, if any, held by such holder, to be prepaid on such date
and stating that such prepayment is to be made pursuant to Paragraph 4B. Notice
of prepayment having been given as aforesaid, the principal amount of the Notes
specified in such notice, together with interest thereon to the prepayment date
and together with the premium, if any, provided in Paragraph 4B, shall become
due and payable on such prepayment date. The Company shall furnish to the
holder of each Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Paragraph 4B, (i) not more
than five and not fewer than three Business Days prior to the prepayment date, a
preliminary written estimate (with supporting calculations) of the Yield-
Maintenance Premium with respect to such Note, and (ii) not later than 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day next preceding the prepayment
date, a written calculation of the Yield-Maintenance Premium with respect to
such Note. So long as you shall hold any Note, the Company shall, (i) at the
time at which it gives written notice of any prepayment pursuant to Paragraph 4B
in respect of any Note held by you, advise you, in the manner set forth in
Schedule I hereto, of the principal amount of the Notes held by you to be
prepaid and the prepayment date, and (ii) at the time at which it gives any
preliminary estimate or any calculation described in the preceding sentence,
provide the same to you in the manner set forth in Schedule I hereto.

4D. Partial Payments Pro Rata. Upon any partial prepayment of the
Notes, the principal amount so prepaid shall be allocated to all Notes at the
time outstanding (including, for the purpose of this Paragraph 4D only, all
Notes prepaid or otherwise retired or purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate other than by prepayment pursuant to
Paragraphs 4A and 4B), in proportion to the respective outstanding principal
amounts thereof.

4E. Right to Put.

(i) Granting of Put. The Company hereby gives and grants to
each Significant Holder (and, solely under the circumstances contemplated by the
second proviso of Paragraph 4E(ii), to the holder of each Note) the option,
right and privilege (such option, right and privilege herein collectively
referred to as the "Right to Put") to require the Company, upon or after the
occurrence of any Designated Event, to purchase from such holder on the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the Company agrees so to purchase from
such holder, for an amount equal to the Agreed Put Consideration, all, but not
less than all, of the Notes held by such holder.

(ii) Exercise of Put. Within 10 Business Days after any
executive officer of the Company has knowledge of the occurrence of any
Designated Event, the Company shall give the holder of each Note written notice
thereof describing such Designated Event, and the facts and circumstances
surrounding the occurrence thereof, in reasonable detail. At any time prior to
90 days after any Significant Holder shall receive such notice, such Significant
Holder may exercise its Right to Put by delivering to the Company a notice of
sale substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (a "Notice of
--------- 
Sale"); provided, that after the first such Notice of Sale is given as to a
-------- 
particular Designated Event, the Company shall deliver a copy of such Notice of
Sale to each Purchaser at its address specified in Schedule I hereto and to each
other Significant Holder and each other Significant Holder shall have until the
later of (a) the expiration of such ninety-day period or (b) 20 days after its
receipt of the first such Notice of Sale to exercise its Right to Put in the
manner specified above; and, provided, further, that the Company shall deliver a
-------- ------- 
copy of each other Notice of Sale to each Purchaser at its address specified in
Schedule I hereto and to each other Significant Holder and if the Company
receives one or more Notices of Sale from a Significant Holder or Significant
Holders that hold, in the aggregate, 20% or more of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, the Company shall give the holder
of each Note prompt written notice thereof, whereupon the holder of each Note
shall have until the later of (x) the expiration of such ninety-day period or
(y) 20 days after its receipt of such notice from the Company to exercise its
Right to Put by delivering to the Company a Notice of Sale. If the holder of a
Note shall deliver a Notice of Sale pursuant to any provision of the preceding
sentence, the Company shall purchase the Notes then held by such holder on the
date specified in such notice (which shall be not less than 30 days after
delivery of such Notice of Sale), and such holder shall sell such Notes to the
Company without recourse, representation or warranty (other than as to such
holder's full right, title and interest to such Notes free of any adverse claim
thereto), at a price, payable in immediately available funds by wire transfer to
the account specified pursuant to Paragraph 11A hereof or to such other account
as may be specified in such notice, equal to the Agreed Put Consideration;
provided, that if more than one holder shall give a Notice of Sale in compliance
- - -------- 
with the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 4E(ii), the Company shall
purchase the Notes held by all such holders on the same day, which shall be the
latest day specified in all such Notices of Sale but in no event more than 180
days after the date of the Company's sending of notice of the occurrence of

-6-
<PAGE>

the Designated Event giving rise thereto, and shall advise the holder of each
Note of such date and the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased by
the Company. Each Significant Holder or holder, as the case may be, shall have
the respective rights specified in this Paragraph 4E with respect to each
Designated Event that shall occur, regardless of any act or omission to act with
respect to any previous Designated Event.

4F. Retirement of Notes. The Company shall not, and shall not permit
any Subsidiary or Affiliate to, prepay or otherwise retire in whole or in part
prior to their stated final maturity (other than by prepayment pursuant to
Paragraphs 4A and 4B or upon acceleration of such final maturity pursuant to
Paragraph 7A), or purchase or otherwise acquire (other than by purchase pursuant
to Paragraph 4E), directly or indirectly, Notes held by any holder unless the
Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have offered to prepay or
otherwise retire or purchase or otherwise acquire, as the case may be, the same
proportion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by each other holder
of Notes at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. Any Notes
prepaid or otherwise retired, purchased (whether pursuant to Paragraph 4E or
otherwise) or otherwise acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose under this Agreement,
except as provided in Paragraph 4D.

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, such compliance to include, without limitation,
paying before the same become delinquent all taxes, assessments and governmental
charges imposed upon the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, or upon

intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration of maturity), all of which are
hereby waived by the Company; (b) if such event is an Event of Default specified
in clause (i) or (ii) of this Paragraph 7A, any Significant Holder that holds a
Note as to which such an Event of Default shall have occurred may at its option,
by notice in writing to the Company, declare such Note to be, and such Note
shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable together with
interest accrued thereon and (to the extent permitted by law) the Yield-
Maintenance Premium, if any, with respect to such Note, without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind (including, without limitation,
notice of intent to accelerate), all of which are hereby waived by the Company;
and (c) if such event is any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
referred to in clause (a) above), the Required Holder(s) may at its or their
option, by notice in writing to the Company, declare all of the Notes to be, and
all of the Notes shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable
together with interest accrued thereon and (to the extent permitted by law) the
Yield-Maintenance Premium, if any, with respect to each Note, without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind (including, without
limitation, notice of intent to accelerate), all of which are hereby waived by
the Company, provided that the Yield-Maintenance Premium, if any, with respect
-------- 
to each Note shall be due and payable upon such declaration only if (x) such
event is an Event of Default specified in any of clauses (i) to (vi), inclusive,
and (xiii) to (xv), inclusive, of this Paragraph 7A and (y) one or more of the
Events of Default so identified shall be continuing at the time of such
declaration. At any time after the principal of, and interest on, any Note or
all of the Notes are declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or clause
(c), as the case may be, of this Paragraph 7A, the Required Holders may, by
written notice to the Company, rescind and annul any such declaration and its
consequences if (1) the Company has paid all interest in arrears on such Note or
Notes, the principal and premium, if any, on any such Note or Notes that have
become due otherwise than by reason of such declaration, and interest on such
overdue principal and premium and (to the extent permitted by law) overdue
interest at a rate specified in the Notes, (2) in the case that all Notes are
declared due and payable pursuant to clause (c) of this Paragraph 7A, all Events
of Default, other than nonpayment of amounts that have become due solely by
reason of such declaration, and all conditions and events that constitute a
Default or an Event of

-23-
<PAGE>

Default have been cured or waived, and (3) no judgment or decree has been
entered for the payment of any monies due on the Notes or pursuant to this
Agreement; but no such rescission and annulment shall extend to or affect any
subsequent Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

7B. Other Remedies. If any Event of Default or Default shall occur
and be continuing, the holder of any Note may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights under this Agreement and such Note by exercising such remedies as are
available to such holder in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit
in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement. No remedy conferred in this
Agreement upon the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

7C. Notice by the Company of Acceleration. If the Required Holders
shall give notice of acceleration of the maturity of all the Notes pursuant to
clause (c) of Paragraph 7A or if any Significant Holder shall give notice of
acceleration of the maturity of the Note or Notes held by it pursuant to clause
(b) of Paragraph 7A, the Company will forthwith give written notice thereof to
the holders of all outstanding Notes, describing the nature and status of the
Event of Default giving rise to such notice of acceleration and what action the
Company proposes to take with respect thereto, unless such a notice has
previously been given by the Company pursuant to Paragraph 5A.

a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware, and each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is

duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. The Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries are duly qualified as foreign corporations to do
business and are in good standing in every jurisdiction in which the nature of
the properties owned or the businesses conducted by them makes such
qualification necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not individually or in the aggregate
have a material adverse effect on the business, financial

-24-
<PAGE>

condition, assets, properties or operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The only Subsidiaries are those identified on
Exhibit E attached hereto, and the percentages of stock of such Subsidiaries
- - --------- 
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company and the states or countries of
incorporation of such Subsidiaries are as stated in Exhibit E attached hereto.
--------- 
All of the outstanding shares of each of the Subsidiaries have been validly
issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and except as set forth on Exhibit E
---------
attached hereto, are free of any adverse claim or other Lien. No Subsidiary
owns any share of stock or other security of the Company.

8B. Financial Statements. The Company has furnished you with the
following financial statements, identified by a principal financial officer of
the Company: (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as at September 30 in each of the years 1990 to 1993, inclusive,
and consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity
of the Company and the Subsidiaries for each such year, certified by KPMG Peat
Marwick; and (ii) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as at December 31 in each of the years 1990 to 1993, inclusive, and
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the three-month period
ended on each such date, prepared by the Company. Such financial statements
(including any related schedules and/or notes) are true and correct in all
material respects (subject, as to interim statements, to changes resulting from
audits and year-end adjustments), have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently followed throughout the
periods involved and show all liabilities, direct and contingent, of the Company
and the Subsidiaries required to be shown in accordance with such principles.
The balance sheets fairly present the financial condition of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof, and the statements of operations and cash
flows fairly present the results of the operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for the periods indicated. There has been no material adverse
change in the business, financial condition, assets, properties or operations of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, since September
30, 1993.

8C. Conflicting Agreements and Other Matters. Neither the Company nor
any of the Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement or subject to
any charter or other corporate restriction that materially and adversely affects
its business, financial condition, assets, properties or operations. Neither
the execution nor delivery of this Agreement or the Notes, nor the offering,
issuance and sale of the Notes, nor fulfillment of nor compliance with the terms
and provisions hereof and of the Notes will conflict with, or result in a breach
of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or
result in any violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, the
charter or by-laws of the Company or any Subsidiary, any award of any arbitrator
or any agreement (including any agreement with stockholders), instrument, order,
judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is subject. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to, or
otherwise subject to any provision contained in, any instrument evidencing
indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary, any agreement

-25-
<PAGE>

relating thereto or any other contract or agreement (including its charter) that
limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the incurring of,
Debt of the Company of the type to be evidenced by the Notes except as set forth
in the agreements listed in Exhibit F attached hereto.
--------- 

8D. Governmental Consent. Neither the nature of the Company or of any
Subsidiary, nor any of their respective businesses or properties, nor any
relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any
circumstance in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or
other action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or
governmental or regulatory body (other than routine filings after the Date of
Closing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state Blue Sky
authorities) in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes or fulfillment of or
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or of the Notes.

8E. Enforceability. This Agreement is, and the Notes when delivered
hereunder will be, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

8F. Actions Pending. There is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any Subsidiary, or any properties or rights of the Company or any
Subsidiary, by or before any court, arbitrator or administrative or governmental
body that might result in any material adverse change in the business, financial
condition, assets, properties or operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. There is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending or threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary that
purports to affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any Note.

8G. Outstanding Debt and Liens. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has outstanding any Debt, except as permitted by Paragraph 6C(2), or
has any property that is subject to a Lien that secures any Debt or any other
obligation, except as permitted by Paragraph 6C(1). There exists no default (or
any waiver thereof that is conditional or is limited in duration) under the
provisions of any instrument evidencing any Debt or any such obligation or of
any agreement relating thereto.

8H. Title to Properties. The Company has and each Subsidiary has (i)
good and marketable title to those of its respective properties held in fee
simple and for which a title insurance policy has been issued, and (ii)
defensible title to all of its other respective material properties and assets,
including the properties and assets, all as reflected in the balance sheet as at
September 30, 1993 referred to in Paragraph 8B (other than (x) properties and
assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business and (y) properties

-26-
<PAGE>

and assets that can be replaced, or purchased from an adverse claimant, for
aggregate expenditures not to exceed $5,000,000), subject to no Lien of any kind
except Liens permitted by Paragraph 6C(1). For purposes of this Paragraph 8H,
the term "defensible title" shall mean such title as a reasonably prudent
purchaser of like properties would accept, subject only to such encumbrances and
title defects as would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely affect the use, enjoyment or operation of the properties in question.
All leases necessary in any material respect for the conduct of the respective
business(es) of the Company and the Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting and
are in full force and effect.

8I. Taxes. The Company has and each Subsidiary has filed all federal,
state and other income tax returns that, to the best knowledge of the officers
of the Company, are required to be filed, and each has paid all taxes as shown
on such returns and on all assessments received by it to the extent that such
taxes have become due, except such taxes as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

8J. Offering of Notes. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on
its behalf has, directly or indirectly, offered the Notes or any similar
security of the Company for sale to, or solicited any offers to buy the Notes or
any similar security of the Company from, or otherwise approached or negotiated
with respect thereto with, any Person other than institutional investors, and
neither the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take
any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the
provisions of section 5 of the Securities Act or to the provisions of any
securities or Blue Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction.

8K. Regulation G, etc. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns or
has any present intention of acquiring any "margin stock" as defined in
Regulation G (12 CFR Part 207) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (herein called "margin stock"). The proceeds of sale of the Notes will
be used to reduce the Debt of the Company outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Agreement and for general corporate purposes. None of such proceeds will be
used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or
ultimate, of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for the purpose of
maintaining, reducing or retiring any indebtedness that was originally incurred
to purchase or carry any stock that is currently a margin stock or for any other
purpose that might constitute this transaction a "purpose credit" within the
meaning of such Regulation G. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on its
behalf has taken or will take any action that might cause this Agreement or the
Notes to violate Regulation G, Regulation T, Regulation X or any other
regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate
the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be
in effect.

8L. ERISA. No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in section
302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with
respect to any Plan. No liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
has been or is expected by the Company to be incurred with respect to any Plan
or any Multiemployer Plan by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates that is or
would be materially adverse to the business, financial condition, assets,
properties or operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred or presently expects
to incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any
Multiemployer Plan that is or would be materially adverse to the business,
financial condition, assets, properties or operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the issuance and sale of the Notes will not involve any transaction that is
subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which
a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975 of the Code. The representation
by the Company in the next preceding sentence is made in reliance upon and
subject to the accuracy of your representation in Paragraph 9 as to the source
of the funds to be used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased
by you.

8M. Disclosure. Neither this Agreement nor any other document,
certificate or statement furnished, or to be furnished, to you by or on behalf
of the Company in connection herewith contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein and therein not misleading. There is no fact (other
than matters of a general economic nature) that materially adversely affects or
in the future may reasonably be expected to (so far as the Company can now
foresee) materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, assets,
properties or operations of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and that has
not been set forth in this Agreement or in the other documents, certificates and
statements furnished to you by or on behalf of the Company prior to the date

Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in effect

adversely affect the business, financial condition, assets, properties or
operations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) The Company and the Subsidiaries, and the plants and sites of
each, have complied with all applicable federal, state, local and regional
statutes, ordinances, orders, judgments, rulings and regulations in effect on
the Date of Closing relating to any matters of pollution or of environmental
regulation or control except, in any such case, where such failure to comply
would not result in a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, assets, properties or operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence,

-28-
<PAGE>

neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received notice of or has actual
knowledge of any actual or claimed or asserted failure so to comply that alone
or together with any other such failure is material and would result in a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, assets, properties
or operations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor their plants or other sites manage,
generate or dispose of, or during their respective periods of use, ownership,

used or defined in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Clean Air Act and the

liability under, such statutes or any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto
or any other applicable law, except where such noncompliance or liability would

assets, properties or operations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

8O. Brokerage. All negotiations relative to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby have been carried on by the Company without the

a brokerage commission or other like payment; and the Company agrees to
indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any such claims.

8P. Possession of Permits, Licenses, Etc. The Company and the
Subsidiaries possess all certificates, licenses, permits and other
authorizations from governmental political subdivisions or regulatory
authorities, and all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names,
copyrights, licenses, and all other rights, that are necessary in any material
respect for the ownership, maintenance and operation of their respective
properties and assets; and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
violation of any thereof in any material respect.

8Q. Public Utility Holding Company Act; Federal Power Act; Investment
Company Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company" or a "public utility company" as
such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended, or a "public utility" as such term is defined in the Federal Power Act,

PARAGRAPH 11. MISCELLANEOUS.

11. Miscellaneous.

11A. Note Payments. So long as you shall hold any Note, the Company
will make payments of principal thereof and premium, if any, and interest
thereon, which comply with the terms of this Agreement, not later than 12:00
noon (New York City time) on the day when due by wire transfer of immediately
available funds for credit to your account or accounts as specified in Schedule
I hereto, or such other account or accounts in the United States as you may
designate in writing, notwithstanding any contrary provision herein or in any
Note with respect to the place of payment. You severally agree that, before
disposing of any Note, you will make a notation thereon (or on a schedule
attached thereto) of all principal payments previously made thereon and of the
date to which interest thereon has been paid. The Company agrees to afford the
benefits of this Paragraph 11A to any Transferee that shall have made the same
agreement as you have made in this Paragraph 11A.

11B. Expenses. The Company agrees, whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated, to pay, and save you and any
Transferee harmless against liability for the payment of, all out-of-pocket
expenses arising in connection with such transactions, including (i) all costs
and expenses of obtaining all necessary private placement numbers, (ii) all
document production and duplication charges and the fees and expenses of any
special counsel engaged by you or any Transferee (otherwise than in connection
with the transfer of any Note) in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby and any subsequent proposed modification of, or
proposed consent under, this Agreement, whether or not such proposed
modification shall be effected or proposed consent granted, and (iii) the costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by you or any Transferee in
administering this Agreement and enforcing any rights under this Agreement or
the Notes or in responding to any subpoena or other legal process issued in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or by
reason of your or any Transferee's having acquired any Note, including without
limitation costs and expenses incurred in any bankruptcy case or in connection
with any actual or proposed work-out or restructuring of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Notes. The obligations of the Company under this
Paragraph 11B shall survive the transfer of any Note or portion thereof or
interest therein by you or any Transferee and the payment of any Note.

-39-
<PAGE>

11C. Consent to Amendments. This Agreement may be amended, and the
Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein
required to be performed by it, if the Company shall obtain the written consent
to such amendment, action or omission to act, of the Required Holder(s) except
that, without the written consent of the holder or holders of all Notes at the
time outstanding, no amendment to this Agreement shall change the maturity of
any Note, or change the principal of, or the rate or time of payment of interest
or any premium payable with respect to any Note, or affect the time, amount or
allocation of any required prepayments, or reduce the proportion of the
principal amount of the Notes required with respect to any consent, or amend the
provisions of Paragraph 4E or, for purposes of such Paragraph, the defined terms
used therein. Each holder of any Note at the time or thereafter outstanding
shall be bound by any consent authorized by this Paragraph 11C, whether or not
such Note shall have been marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued
thereafter may bear a notation referring to any such consent. No course of
dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in
exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of
any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein and in the Notes, the
term "this Agreement" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may
from time to time be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified.

11D. Form, Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Notes; Lost Notes.
The Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in denominations of
at least $100,000, except as may be necessary to reflect any principal amount
not evenly divisible by $100,000. The Company shall keep at its principal
office a register in which the Company shall provide for the registration of
Notes and of transfers of Notes. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of
any Note at the principal office of the Company, the Company shall, at its
expense, execute and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor and of a like
aggregate principal amount, registered in the name of such transferee or
transferees. At the option of the holder of any Note, such Note may be
exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and of any authorized denominations, of
a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Note to be exchanged at
the principal office of the Company. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
exchange, the Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver the Notes that
the holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Note surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed, by the holder of
such Note or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Any Note or
Notes issued in exchange for any Note or upon transfer thereof shall carry the
rights to unpaid interest and interest to accrue that were carried by the Note
so exchanged or transferred, so that neither gain nor loss of interest shall
result from any such transfer or exchange. Upon receipt of written notice from
the holder of any Note of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such
Note and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of
such holder's unsecured indemnity agreement, or in the case of any such
mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, the Company will make
and deliver a new Note, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Note.

<PAGE>

11E. Persons Deemed Owners; Participations. Prior to due presentment
for registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in whose name any
Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the purpose of

overdue, and the Company shall not be affected by notice to the contrary.

and conditions as may be determined by such holder in its sole and absolute
discretion.

behalf of the Company in connection herewith shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the transfer by you of any Note or
portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be
