FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Chicago, Illinois -- October 19, 1994 -- Joslyn Corporation today
reported 1994 third quarter net sales of $55,803,000 and a net loss of
$17,000,000 or $2.39 per share, after taking a special charge of $35.0
million ($21.0 million after tax or $2.95 per share) for increased
environmental reserves. Without the special charge, Joslyn's 1994
third quarter operations would have resulted in net income of
$4,000,000 or $0.56 per share. Net sales for the third quarter of
1993 were $53,689,000 and net income for such quarter was $3,832,000
or $0.54 per share. Income before taxes and the environmental charge
of $6,100,000 for the third quarter of 1994 is 9.3% higher than in the
third quarter of 1993. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 1994, net sales were
$164,194,000 and the net loss was $9,898,000 or $1.39 per share. For
the nine months ended September 30, 1993, net sales were $167,230,000
and net income was $11,690,000 or $1.65 per share.

Special Charge for Increased Environmental Reserves

As previously disclosed, the 1994 third quarter special charge relates
principally to the clean-up of a former wood treating site located at
Panama, Oklahoma. Joslyn was first notified by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) that it is a potentially responsible party
(PRP) at the Oklahoma site on July 27, 1994. Joslyn sold the site in
1955, after operating it for 16 years. Although one prior and three
subsequent owners have operated a wood treating facility at the site,
it initially appears that Joslyn may be the only significant
financially viable PRP and Joslyn's insurance coverage during such
period may be minimal. Joslyn believes that 10% to 20% of the
remediation costs will be expended over the next couple of years at
the Oklahoma site and that most of the remediation will take place
during a period five to ten years from now. 

Determining Joslyn's ultimate cost associated with remediating former
wood treating sites is subject to many variables, including the
availability of economical remediation technologies, the volume of
contaminated soil, contributions from other PRPs, insurance recoveries
and changes in applicable laws and regulations. Joslyn's
investigation of the Oklahoma site is still in the preliminary stages. 
Most of the special charge reflects an estimate prepared by Joslyn's
environmental consultants of the costs for environmental response at
the Oklahoma site, based on the limited data about the Oklahoma site
that is currently available, Joslyn's experience with nearly completed
clean-ups and recent actions by USEPA at other sites. This estimate
assumes that Joslyn will be allowed to apply the remediation
technologies at the Oklahoma site that it has applied elsewhere. 
Certain of such technologies are among the least expensive of various
alternatives. The balance of the special charge reflects estimates of
Joslyn's exposure at certain other locations, as to which very little
information is available, that are not currently known to be under
investigation by environmental agencies. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that Joslyn's estimates of its environmental liabilities
will not change. For instance, if technologies other than those
assumed to be available are utilized at the Oklahoma site or if the
volume of contaminated soil at that site is significantly greater than
that suggested by preliminary data, remediation costs could more than
double.

In addition to the $35 million charge taken in the 1994 third quarter,
Joslyn currently has approximately a net $14 million reserve remaining
(after expenditures and recoveries, including $5.8 million received in
the 1994 third quarter from insurance and other sources) from a $30
million charge in 1987 for estimated remediation costs for known sites
then under investigation by environmental agencies. None of the 1987
charge relates to the sites covered by the 1994 third quarter special
charge.
