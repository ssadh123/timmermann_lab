Item 1. Changes in Control of Registrant.

Not applicable.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On March 31, 1994, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization dated January 29, 1994 (the "Reorganization Agreement"), among
the Registrant, Octel Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant ("Sub"), and VMX, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("VMX"), and a related Agreement of Merger dated March 31, 1994
(the "Merger Agreement") between Sub and VMX, Sub was merged with and into VMX
and VMX, as the surviving corporation, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Registrant (the "Merger"). The Registrant designs, manufactures and markets
voice information processing systems that use the touch-tone telephone as the
terminal and the fax machine as the printer. These multi-functional,
specialized computers and personal computer-based systems allow users to
access, manage and integrate multiple forms of information -- voice,
information and data -- across the worldwide telephone network in a single call
from any touch-tone telephone in the world. VMX designs, manufactures and
markets customer premise equipment applications using a broad range of voice
processing systems and software products that permit the creation of
communication solutions specifically designed to each particular organization's
requirements.

As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of VMX Common
Stock was exchanged for 0.2 shares of Registrant's Common Stock. The
outstanding VMX Common Stock was exchanged for an aggregate of 6,371,950 shares
of the Registrant's Common Stock, including shares reserved for issuance upon
exercise of options to purchase VMX Common Stock assumed by Registrant.

The ratio at which VMX Common Stock was exchanged for Registrant
Common Stock was determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the
Reorganization Agreement and the Merger Agreement. The formula was agreed upon
in arms' length negotiation of the terms of the Merger and took into account
various factors concerning the relative valuations of the Registrant and VMX.
The Registrant received an opinion from its financial advisor that the Merger
was fair to the Registrant from a financial point of view.

Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, the Registrant agreed to
assume all options to purchase VMX Common Stock outstanding at the effective
time of the Merger, subject to the provision that the options so assumed would
become options to purchase Common Stock of the Registrant, with appropriate
adjustments to the number of shares and exercise price of each instrument to
reflect the ratio at which VMX Common Stock was converted into the Registrant's
Common Stock. As a result of the Merger, the Registrant has assumed options
which represent the right to purchase 940,265 shares of Common Stock of the
Registrant.

The Merger constitutes a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and will be treated by the
Registrant as a "pooling of interests" for accounting purposes.

Each stockholder of VMX who was an affiliate of VMX and each
affiliate of the Registrant agreed to certain restrictions on transfer with
respect to the shares of Common Stock of the Registrant acquired by such
stockholder in the Merger or owned by such stockholder prior to the Merger. In
addition, certain officers and key employees of VMX have entered into
employment agreements with the Registrant.

Not applicable.
