ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On June 15, 1993, Southwestern Life Corporation (former
ly, I.C.H. Corporation) ("SLC"), Consolidated National Corporation
("CNC") and Consolidated Fidelity Life Insurance Company ("CFLIC")
entered into an agreement (the "1993 Agreement") under which
(a) SLC was authorized, and undertook the obligation, to negotiate
the termination of retrocession agreements (the "Retrocession
Agreements") pursuant to which CFLIC reinsured certain annuity
business written by Southwestern Life Insurance Company ("South-
western Life"), a subsidiary of SLC, and Bankers Life and Casualty
Company ("BLC"), a former subsidiary of SLC; and (b) SLC invested
assets (consisting of a limited partnership interest, that has
since been liquidated, and 83% of the outstanding stock of I.C.H.
Funding Corp.) to acquire preferred stock of CFLIC, with a stated
value of $63 million, which preferred stock was to be repurchased
by CFLIC immediately following termination of the Retrocession
Agreements. The Retrocession Agreements were entered into in 1990,
in conjunction with the Company's sale of Marquette National Life
Insurance Company ("Marquette") to CNC and its stockholders. Under
the Retrocession Agreements, Employers Reassurance Corporation, an
independent third party reinsurer ("ERC"), retroceded to CFLIC
certain annuity business which was reinsured with ERC by each of
Southwestern Life and BLC.

On June 30, 1994, agreements were executed pursuant to
which the Retrocession Agreements were terminated, and the business
reinsured thereunder was recaptured, effective as of April 1, 1994. 
Immediately prior to the termination of the Retrocession Agree-
ments, Union Bankers Insurance Company ("Union Bankers"), an
indirect subsidiary of SLC, purchased 100% of the outstanding stock
of Marquette for its estimated fair value of $8,215,354, pursuant
to an agreement entered into on June 3, 1994. The purchase was made
utilizing available cash at Union Bankers. The fair value of
Marquette was based on the fair value of its underlying assets and
liabilities, plus an additional $2,120,172, principally reflecting
the fair value of Marquette's various state insurance licenses as
determined by an independent actuarial firm. At June 30, 1994,
Marquette had assets, primarily U.S. Treasury obligations, totaling
approximately $6,415,000. Following completion of the terminations,
on June 30, 1994, CFLIC repurchased the shares of its preferred
stock held by SLC by transferring to SLC the senior secured loan of
SLC, with an outstanding principal balance of $30 million; 541,563
shares of Series 1984-A Preferred Stock of SLC, stated value
$22,241,992, constituting all of the shares of that series then
outstanding; 140,000 shares of $4.50 Redeemable Preferred Stock,
Series 1987-B of SLC, stated value $7,000,000, constituting all of
the shares of that series then outstanding; 620,423 shares of
Common Stock of SLC; and a U.S. Treasury Note, par value
$1,050,000.

The termination of the Retrocession Agreements and
CFLIC's repurchase of its preferred stock are not expected to have
a significant effect on SLC's total consolidated assets or common

<PAGE>

stockholders' equity. On a prospective basis, the retirement of
SLC's remaining senior secured loan and the two classes of SLC
preferred stock are expected to result in annual savings of
interest expense and preferred dividend requirements totaling in
excess of $5.0 million.

The termination of the Retrocession Agreement relating to
the business written by Southwestern Life was accomplished pursuant
to a Termination and Recapture Agreement executed by ERC, CFLIC,
Southwestern Life and SLC. With the termination, Consolidated
Fidelity transferred assets with a fair value equal to the reserve
liabilities being recaptured, net of the ceding fees payable. Due
primarily to a requirement by insurance regulatory authorities to
transfer such investments upon termination of the Retrocession
Agreements at their fair value, SLC increased its basis in the
CFLIC preferred stock by investing an additional $26,211,995
(including $21,077,870 cash and a $5,134,125 receivable) immediate-
ly prior to the terminations to enable CFLIC to have sufficient
assets (other than the SLC securities being transferred to SLC upon
redemption of the CFLIC preferred stock) to complete the termina-
tions. A substantial portion of such amount was attributable to a
decline in the fair value of the 83% interest in I.C.H. Funding
Corp. subsequent to SLC's transfer of such investment to CFLIC in
June 1993. As previously reported in SLC's 1993 Annual Report on
Form 10-K, the 1993 Agreement contemplated that SLC would benefit
or suffer the consequences to the extent of any appreciation or
depreciation in the value of the assets transferred to CFLIC. The
assets transferred to Southwestern Life by CFLIC upon termination
of the Retrocession Agreement relating to the business written by
Southwestern Life included, in part, the additional $21,077,870 of
cash.

At March 31, 1994, the amount of Southwestern Life's
reserve liabilities reinsured by CFLIC totaled $323,305,188, of
which $107,162,798 was recaptured by Southwestern Life. After
deduction of a $13,221,227 ceding fee paid by Southwestern Life,
CFLIC transferred to Southwestern Life assets with an estimated
fair value of $93,941,571. The assets transferred to Southwestern
Life consisted of cash, short-term investments and marketable fixed
maturity investments (fair value of $25,455,251), CFLIC's invest-
ments in I.C.H. Funding Corp. and certain pass-through certificates
issued by a special purpose trust sponsored by Fund America
Investors Corporation ("FAIC II"), (estimated fair value of
$12,527,888), collateral loans due from James M. Fail and CFSB
Corporation (the "Fail/CFSB Loans") totaling $50,639,572, mortgage
loans totaling $5,239,652, and a common stock investment of
$79,208. Rather than transferring to Southwestern Life certain
real estate and a collateral loan that Southwestern Life could have
required CNC and CFLIC to repurchase pursuant to the 1993 Agree-
ment, on June 15, 1995, the parties agreed to increase the amount
of the Fail/CFSB Loans being transferred, to 100% of CFLIC's
interest therein.

<PAGE>

The remaining reserve liabilities of Southwestern Life
that were reinsured by CFLIC, totaling $216,142,390 as of March 31,
1994, were recaptured by, and remain reinsured with, ERC. After
deduction of a $20,669,773 ceding fee paid by ERC, CFLIC trans-
ferred to ERC assets, consisting primarily of cash, short-term
investments and marketable fixed maturity investments, with an
estimated fair value of approximately $195,472,617. The reinsur-
ance agreement between ERC and Southwestern Life, and related
documents, relating to the business recaptured by ERC were amended
to, among other things, permit ERC to recover, out of the future
profits of the reinsured business, the ceding fee it paid CFLIC,
together with interest at 2%.

The amount of the ceding fees paid to CFLIC in connection
with the recapture of the business written by Southwestern Life was
determined by management of SLC utilizing the methodology developed
by an independent actuarial firm prior to the execution of the 1993
Agreement, with appropriate adjustments in assumptions to reflect
changes in market interest rates and other factors. The fair
values of marketable fixed maturity investments were determined
based on quoted market prices as published by nationally recognized
pricing services as of March 31, 1994. The fair value of CFLIC's
investments in I.C.H. Funding Corp. and FAIC II were determined by
an independent investment banking firm, based on the value of their
respective underlying assets as of June 30, 1994. The value of the
remaining assets were transferred at their book value.

Pursuant to the 1993 Agreement, SLC agreed to bear the
federal income tax consequences resulting from the termination of
the Retrocession Agreements. By letter dated June 30, 1994, SLC,
CNC and CFLIC clarified the obligations of SLC to indemnify CNC and
CFLIC for tax liabilities of CFLIC and Marquette arising through
June 30, 1994, and they entered into an escrow agreement pursuant
to which $8,825,000 of cash which SLC was to have received upon
CFLIC's repurchase of its preferred stock was deposited in escrow
as a source of funds for the payment of taxes for which SLC is
responsible. With the payment of such tax liabilities, SLC will be
entitled to all tax refunds to which CFLIC is entitled through the
carryback of capital losses resulting from the termination of the
Retrocession Agreements or as a result of any redetermination of
CFLIC's tax liabilities through the first taxable period of CFLIC
and Marquette ending after such termination. SLC management has
estimated that CFLIC will be entitled to tax refunds totaling
approximately $5.8 million through the carryback of capital losses. 
Upon collection of the tax refund, SLC will utilize a portion of
the proceeds to satisfy the remaining $5,134,125 receivable held by
CFLIC.

On June 30, 1994, SLC, CNC and CFLIC also entered into an
Amendment to Agreement, whereby they amended the 1993 Agreement to,
among other things, substitute and reconcile the assets and
earnings thereon that CFLIC was entitled to retain following the
termination of the Retrocession Agreements and the repurchase of
the CFLIC preferred stock. These assets and earnings had an

<PAGE>

aggregate statutory value, on CFLIC's books, of approximately $75.4
million. Under the 1993 Agreement, SLC was granted the option, in
the future, either to purchase shares of common stock of Nacolah
Holding Corporation held by CFLIC at its cost or to receive
$775,000 from CNC and CFLIC. The Amendment to Agreement also
granted CNC and CFLIC the right, during the period from June 30,
1994 until October 31, 1994, to pay SLC $775,000 to terminate this
option.

CFLIC is owned by CNC and CNC's three stockholders, one
of whom is C. Fred Rice, an officer and director of SLC. Prior to
February 11, 1994, CNC held shares of Class B Common Stock of SLC
entitling it to elect 75% of the directors of SLC. In addition, 
CNC provided management and consulting services to SLC and its
subsidiaries pursuant to a Management and Consulting Agreement and
both CNC and CFLIC beneficially owned in excess of 5% of the Common
Stock of SLC. On February 11, 1994, SLC repurchased the Class B
Common Stock and terminated its Management and Consulting Agreement
with CNC, concurrently with CNC's sale of Common Stock of SLC to
Stephens Inc. and Torchmark Corporation. The February 11, 1994
transactions reduced the amount of Common Stock of SLC beneficially
owned by CNC and its affiliates to 6.73%. The transactions
consummated on June 30, 1994, described above, further reduced the
amount of Common Stock of SLC beneficially owned by CNC and its
affiliates to 2.12%.

RE: AGREEMENT DATED JUNE 15, 1993 - TAX MATTERS

Gentlemen:

Reference is hereby made to that certain Agreement dated June
15, 1993 (the "1993 Agreement") by and among I.C.H. Corporation,
now known as Southwestern Life Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("ICH"), Consolidated National Corporation, a Kentucky corporation
("CNC") and Consolidated Fidelity Life Insurance Company, a
Kentucky insurance company ("CFLIC"). Except as otherwise provided
herein, all capitalized terms used in this letter agreement shall
have the meanings indicated in the 1993 Agreement. ICH desires to
clarify certain obligations and rights of the parties relating to
Taxes under the 1993 Agreement. The parties recognize that any
liability for Taxes of CFLIC and Marquette referred to herein shall
include Taxes of any of CFLIC, Marquette, or any subsidiary of
either of them and shall include any such Taxes imposed upon any
successor in interest thereto, including but not limited to CNC. 
The terms CFLIC and Marquette include their respective successors
in interest.

At its sole cost and expense, ICH shall timely prepare and
file all returns applicable to Taxes of CFLIC and Marquette for all
taxable periods prior to and including and ending with the first
taxable period of CFLIC and Marquette, respectively, ending after
the date hereof (collectively hereinafter, the "Indemnified
Periods"). CNC and CFLIC shall cooperate with ICH in connection
therewith. Other than for Taxes on the earnings from the Excepted
Assets that accrue after June 30, 1994 (the "Excepted Assets

<PAGE>

Consolidated National Corporation
Consolidated Fidelity Life Insurance Company
June 30, 1994
Page 2

Earnings"), ICH shall indemnify and hold CNC and CFLIC harmless
from any Taxes of CFLIC and Marquette for the Indemnified Periods,
which shall include but not be limited to any Taxes attributable to
the Recaptures or the redemption of the CFLIC Securities. ICH has
estimated that the liability of CFLIC and Marquette for Taxes for
the calendar year 1993 and for the period January 1, 1994 through
and including June 30, 1994 (exclusive of any refund of Taxes
attributable to any carryback of any loss), after taking into
account estimated Tax payments which have been made, is $8,825,000
(the "Tax Liability Estimate"). ICH recognizes that Taxes have
been previously withheld from the Excepted Assets Earnings in
calculating the Excepted Assets Earnings to which CNC is entitled
for the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994 and that,
accordingly, the Tax Liability Estimate shall include an amount for
Taxes on such Excepted Assets Earnings for such period. Simulta-
neous with the closing of the Recaptures and the redemption of the
CFLIC Securities, ICH shall deposit with Mid-America Bank and Trust
Company of Louisville, as escrow agent ("Escrow Agent"), immediate-
ly available federal funds in an amount equal to the Tax Liability
Estimate, which amount shall be held and disbursed as a fund (the
"Escrow Fund") by Escrow Agent pursuant to this letter agreement
and an Escrow Agreement to be executed by ICH, CFLIC and the Escrow
Agent, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Upon the earlier of the completion for filing of each of the
Tax returns for CFLIC and Marquette for the applicable Indemnified
Periods, or three (3) Business Days prior to the respective due
date thereof (or if estimated Tax payments are required prior to
such filing, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
due date thereof), CFLIC shall direct the Escrow Agent to disburse
to CFLIC an amount equal to the Taxes payable upon the filing of
such return (or the applicable due date of such estimated Tax
payment if earlier) from and out of the Escrow Fund, which amount
disbursed shall be promptly paid by CFLIC to the applicable Tax
authority. If, upon the filing of any Tax return for CFLIC and/or
Marquette for the Indemnified Periods, or upon audit or any
redetermination of Taxes by any applicable Tax authority, the
actual liability for Taxes of CFLIC and Marquette for the Indemni-
fied Periods (exclusive of any refund of Taxes attributable to any
carryback of any loss arising during any Indemnified Period) shall
exceed the then balance of the Escrow Fund (including any earnings
thereon), ICH shall contribute such excess to CFLIC (or its
successor in interest) as a return of excess value received for the
redemption of the CFLIC Securities, which amount shall be paid by
CFLIC (or its successor in interest) to the appropriate Tax
authority (if not previously so paid prior to such receipt). If
such contribution shall be determined to be subject to Tax, such

<PAGE>

Consolidated National Corporation
Consolidated Fidelity Life Insurance Company

Page 3

contribution shall be appropriately grossed-up to compensate CFLIC
(or its successor in interest) for such Tax.

Provided ICH complies with its obligations under this letter
agreement, if, upon filing of the final Tax return for CFLIC and/or
Marquette for the Indemnified Periods and after the disbursement
from the Escrow Fund to CFLIC to pay the Taxes shown to be due
thereon, the then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund (including
any earnings thereon) shall exceed the actual liability for Taxes
of CFLIC and Marquette for the Indemnified Periods (exclusive of
any refund of Taxes attributable to any carryback of any loss
arising during any Indemnified Period), CFLIC shall promptly direct
the Escrow Agent to pay the excess to ICH. Provided ICH complies
with its obligations under this letter agreement, promptly upon
receipt thereof, CFLIC (or its successor in interest) shall pay to
ICH (i) the amount of any refund of Taxes attributable to any
capital loss carryback arising from losses recognized in the
Recaptures and the redemption of the CFLIC Securities and (ii) the
amount of any refund of Taxes attributable to any audit or
redetermination of Taxes of CFLIC or Marquette for the Indemnified
Periods. Any claim for refund of Taxes filed on behalf of CFLIC or
Marquette for the Indemnified Periods shall include an application
for electronic funds transfer of such refund to an account jointly
designated by the parties hereto.

If it is determined, whether as a result of an Internal
Revenue Service audit or otherwise, that CFLIC (or its successor in
interest) has positive earnings and profits for federal income tax
purposes as of the date hereof and after taking into account the
Recaptures and the redemption of the CFLIC Securities, then ICH
shall pay to CNC (or its successor in interest) an amount equal to
the Taxes attributable to or payable as a result of any distribu-
tion to its shareholders of the amount of such earnings and profits
by CFLIC or its successor in interest, whether pursuant to section
1375(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
otherwise.

Except for the matters specifically addressed in this letter
agreement, the obligations and agreements of the parties in the
1993 Agreement shall remain unmodified and in full force and
effect.

NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

1. DEFINITIONS. Unless otherwise defined herein, defined

for income tax purposes; provided, however, that the Income shall
be disbursed pursuant to Section 3 as a part of the Escrow Fund. 
For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, the term "Repurchase
Accounts" shall mean repurchase accounts under which Escrow Agent
agrees to sell, and ICH agrees to purchase, certain direct
obligations of, or obligations that are fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States or any agency thereof
(hereinafter, "Securities"), in the amount of such balance and at
maturity, ICH will sell and Escrow Agent will repurchase the
Securities at the same price at which they were sold to ICH,
payable immediately; plus interest payable to ICH. The approximate
market value of the underlying Securities will be 102 percent of
the Escrow Fund.

3. DISPOSITION OF ESCROW FUND. Disbursements from the
Escrow Fund shall be made by Escrow Agent in accordance with and
within two Business Days (as defined below) after receipt of a

Sunday or any day on which commercial banks in Louisville, Kentucky
are required to close by law.

4. RESPONSIBILITIES OF ESCROW AGENT. Escrow Agent's duties
and responsibilities shall be limited to those expressly set forth

ty for listing any securities in its possession as part of the
Escrow Fund for ad valorem taxes, and ICH and CFLIC, jointly and
severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent from
and against any taxes, interest or penalties asserted against
Escrow Agent for its failure to so list such securities. Escrow
Agent is acting hereunder as a depository only and shall not be
responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the sufficiency,
correctness, genuineness or validity of any instrument which Escrow
Agent in good faith believes to be genuine, or for the identity,
authority or rights of any person executing or delivering such
instrument. Notwithstanding any provision herein incorporating
other instruments by reference, except as expressly set forth in
Section 3 hereof, Escrow Agent shall not be charged with notice of 
the terms of any such instruments and its duties and responsibili-
ties shall be determined solely by reference to this Escrow
Agreement.

5. NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF ESCROW AGENT. In performing any
of its duties hereunder, Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability
to anyone for any damages, losses, or expenses except for actions
taken or not taken in bad faith, willful default or gross negli-
gence, and it shall accordingly not incur any such liability with
respect (i) to any action taken or omitted in good faith upon
advice of its counsel given with respect to any questions relating
to the duties and responsibilities of Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement, or (ii) to any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including, but not limited to any
Payment Notice or other written instructions contemplated herein,
not only as to due execution of such instrument and the validity
and effectiveness of its provisions but also as to the truth and
accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow Agent
shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been signed or
presented by a proper person or persons and to conform with the
provisions of this Agreement.

6. EMPLOYMENT OF COUNSEL. ICH and CFLIC, jointly and
severally, hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation and counsel
fees and disbursements, which may be imposed upon Escrow Agent or
incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with its acceptance of
appointment as Escrow Agent hereunder, or the performance of its
duties hereunder, including any litigation arising from this Escrow
Agreement or involving the subject matter hereof.

promptly upon its receipt of a statement therefor from the Escrow
Agent.

giving thirty (30) day prior written notice to ICH and CFLIC; and

reasonable fees for services and to be compensated for its proper

responsibility under the Escrow Agreement.

9. INDEMNIFICATION. In the event of a disagreement between
the parties hereto, resulting in claims and/or demands being made
by the disputing parties which, in the sole judgment of Escrow
Agent are conflicting, in connection with any matters involving or
affected by this Escrow Agreement, Escrow Agent shall be entitled,
at its sole option, to refuse to comply with any such demands so
long as such disagreement shall continue. Escrow Agent may
continue to refuse to take any action, irrespective of the time
which elapses during which such dispute continues, until either the
rights of the disputing claimants have been duly adjudicated and
Escrow Agent shall have received a certified copy of a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect thereto,
or the disputing claimants shall have furnished to Escrow Agent
joint instructions with respect to the action to be taken. If
Escrow Agent receives such joint instructions and shall be fully
protected and indemnified by the parties hereto in taking any
action in reliance thereon. All actions taken by Escrow Agent
pursuant to any final order of a court of competent jurisdiction
shall be conclusively presumed to be taken in good faith. In no
event shall Escrow Agent be required to file an interpleader or
similar type or action or to defend any action or legal proceeding
filed against it, but it may do so in its sole discretion.

tions to be given under this Escrow Agreement shall be in writing,

of valuation. This adjustment is applicable
for estimated pre-payments as well as delayed
payments."

(d) ARTICLE XVI. Article XVI is deleted in its entirety.

(e) ARTICLE XVIII. Article XVIII is amended to read as
follows:

"RECAPTURE. By giving to the CORPORATION at

hereunder. Such recapture shall become effec-
tive at the end of the following calendar

<PAGE>
be negotiated in good faith with due consider-
ation to federal income taxes, interest main-
tenance reserve and asset valuation reserve
effects on both parties. Recapture shall not
be unreasonably denied by the CORPORATION.

(b) PARTIAL RECAPTURE. In the event of a
partial recapture, as soon as practicable
after the date the partial recapture is effec-
tive, the CORPORATION shall deliver to the
REINSURED the Escrow Assets applicable to the
recaptured business and the amount of addi-
tional cash, if any, required to equal the
policy reserves less any negotiated recapture
fee.

(c) FULL RECAPTURE. In the event of a full
recapture, as soon as practicable after the
date recapture is effective, the CORPORATION
shall deliver to the REINSURED the Escrow
Assets and the amount of additional cash, if
any, required for the then book value of the
Escrow Assets (after adjustments for permanent
impairments through the date recapture is
effective) and additional cash to equal policy
reserves plus the amount(s) then due REINSURED
pursuant to Article X hereof, calculated as if
the recapture date were the end of the ac-
counting period.

The REINSURED shall owe the CORPORATION and
the CORPORATION is hereby authorized to reduce
the amount required in the preceding paragraph
by the sum of (1) any negotiated recapture fee
and (2) the carryover amount, if any, (with
interest thereon) existing hereunder pursuant
to paragraph 5 of Schedule 1-A, calculated as
if the recapture date were the end of an
accounting period, and (3) any amount(s) then
due the CORPORATION pursuant to Article X
hereof, calculated as if the recapture date
were the end of the accounting period."

the effective date of this Amendment No. 4 by
the CORPORATION pertaining to the business
reinsured;

(for the purposes of the foregoing clauses
(b), (c) and (d), statutory accounting princi-
ples shall be applied as the initial book
values of the assets in the Portfolio which
are the market values of such assets on the
first day of the calendar quarter in the which
the Effective Date of this Amendment No. 4
falls);

and (ii) is the sum of:

(a) All benefits paid by the Corporation with
respect to the policies reinsured hereunder;

3. Quarterly and Annual Calculations. The
Formula Amount and Experience Refund shall be
calculated and reported in accordance with
Article X.

4. Carryover Amounts. If for any year the
excess of 2(i) over 2(ii) is negative, the

Formula Amounts in future periods.

For the period immediately following the
accounting period for which 2(i) over 2(ii) is
positive, the amount in 2(ii)(f) above shall
be increased from $40,000 to $60,000.

5. Rules of Construction. In interpreting and
applying the provisions of this Schedule 1-A,
adjustments shall be made as necessary for any
provision of this Schedule 1-A to operate in a
manner that is consistent with the other
provisions hereof, so as to avoid inequitable
results in the nature of double-counting or
failing to recognize costs or benefits that
may enter into the calculations hereunder
through multiple provisions. The parties agree
to cooperate in good faith in resolving any

<PAGE>
issues that may arise with respect to the
calculations pursuant to this Schedule 1-A."

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
