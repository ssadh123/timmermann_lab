ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On August 27, 1994, MSG Holdings, L.P. ("Holdings"), a partnership
between a subsidiary of ITT Corporation ("ITT") and a subsidiary of Rainbow
Programming Holdings, Inc. ("Rainbow"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision"), entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger with Viacom Inc., Paramount Communications Realty Corporation,
ITT and Rainbow Garden Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rainbow,
pursuant to which Holdings will acquire Madison Square Garden Corporation
("MSG") in a transaction in which MSG will be merged with and into Holdings.
The purchase price payable by Holdings for MSG will be approximately $1.075
billion, payable in cash.

MSG owns the world famous 20,000 seat Madison Square Garden Arena and
the adjoining 5,600 seat Paramount Theater; the National Hockey League ("NHL")
Stanley Cup Champion New York Rangers; the National Basketball Association
("NBA") Championship finalist New York Knicks; and the Madison Square Garden
Network, with five million subscribers for Knicks basketball, Rangers hockey,
Yankees baseball, boxing, college basketball and other programming.

The acquisition is subject to customary terms and conditions including
the expiration of Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting periods and approvals by the NHL
and the NBA of the indirect transfers of the sports franchises, and is expected
to close by December 31, 1994.

ITT, Rainbow and Cablevision are parties to an Agreement, made as of
August 15, 1994 (the "Bid Agreement"), pursuant to which it has been agreed
that Holdings will fund the purchase price of the acquisition through (i) an
equity contribution from Rainbow of $110 million, (ii) borrowing from a third
party or from ITT, and (iii) an equity contribution from ITT of the balance.
Within 12 months following the MSG closing, Rainbow may elect to acquire
interests in Holdings from ITT sufficient to equalize the equity ownership of
ITT and Rainbow in Holdings.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
