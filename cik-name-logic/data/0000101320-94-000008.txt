Item 5 Other Events

UJB Financial Corp. (UJB) voluntarily reports the following
information:

On December 16, 1993, UJB entered into an agreement to acquire
VSB Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Valley Savings
Bank (VSB). The transaction, accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests, was consummated on July 1, 1994 and UJB
stock was subsequently exchanged for VSB stock at the rate of
.7727 shares of UJB common stock for each share of VSB common
stock . There were 2,628,912 shares of UJB common stock issued
for 3,402,619 shares of VSB common stock. 

Combined condensed results of operations of UJB and VSB on a
pro forma basis is presented as follows (as reported in part on
Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 1994) for the three
months ended March 31,1994 and June 30, 1994, and the six months
ended June 30, 1994 (dollars in thousands except per share):

One of the required criteria for pooling of interests accounting
is that the parties to the business combination must share
mutually in the combined risks and rights of the transaction. 
In order to satisfy this risk sharing criteria of pooling of
interests accounting, Securities and Exchange Commission
Accounting Series Release 135 provides that the risk sharing
will have occurred if no affiliate of either party to the merger
transaction sells or otherwise disposes of any common stock
received in the transaction until such time as financial
results covering 30 days of post-merger combined operations have
been published. 

In order to satisfy the risk sharing criteria, and thereby allow
affiliates of either party to the transaction to sell or
otherwise dispose of UJB common stock acquired in the merger (in

compliance with SEC Rules 145 and 144 regarding resales of
common stock acquired in a business combination) provided below
are financial results which reflect the required 30 days of
post-merger combined operations as required by SEC Accounting
Series Release 135 ( dollars in thousands except per share):
