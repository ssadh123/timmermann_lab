M.D.C. HOLDINGS, INC. ANNOUNCES PLAN TO ACQUIRE RICHMOND HOMES

DENVER, DECEMBER 8 -- M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (NYSE/PSE: MDC), one of the
nation's largest home builders and mortgage lending companies, announced today
that it has entered into agreements providing MDC with the right to acquire all
of the shares of common stock and preferred stock of Richmond Homes, Inc. I that
are not owned currently by MDC. Richmond Homes is a 45%-owned consolidated
affiliate of MDC through which MDC conducts substantially all of its Colorado
home building activities. Upon the acquisition of such shares, MDC will own
100% of the capital stock of Richmond Homes.

MDC has entered into a purchase agreement with the Base Assets Trust, a
liquidating trust formed under the laws of California and created pursuant to
that certain Base Assets Trust Agreement dated September 3, 1993 by and among
John Garamendi, solely in his capacity as Commissioner of the California
Department of Insurance and conservator, rehabilitator and liquidator of
Executive Life Insurance Company, and the trustee(s), providing for the purchase
by MDC of (i) 1,990 shares (19.9%) of Richmond Homes common stock; (ii) 1,400
shares of Richmond Homes Class A preferred stock; and (iii) a general
partnership interest in the Rock Creek Investment Partnership for an aggregate
purchase price of $16,140,000 in cash. In addition, the agreement provides that
MDC will purchase 2,560,866 shares of MDC common stock from Base Assets for a
per share purchase price equal to the higher of (w) $5.75; (x) the average of
the daily closing sales prices on the New York Stock Exchange of the MDC common
stock for 20 trading days out of the 30-day trading period ending on the second
business day prior to the closing of the transaction, such 20 trading days to be
selected by Base Assets; (y) the per share sale price of the MDC common stock to
a third party arranged by MDC; or (z) the closing sale price of the MDC common
stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on a specified date.

To complete, among other things, the acquisition of Richmond Homes, MDC
also entered into an option agreement with Messrs. Larry A. Mizel and David D.
Mandarich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice
President-Real Estate of MDC, respectively. Pursuant to this agreement, MDC has
been granted an option to purchase all of the 3,500 shares (35%) of Richmond
Homes common stock owned by Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich for an aggregate
purchase price ranging from a minimum of $2,000,000 up to a maximum of
$3,500,000. The final price for these 3,500 shares will be based upon the
valuation of Richmond Homes as determined by the independent financial advisor
to be retained by a Special Committee established by the Board of Directors of
MDC in connection with such transaction. The form of consideration will consist
of shares of MDC common stock valued at $5.75.

The acquisition of the capital stock of Richmond Homes pursuant to these
agreements is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that these transactions will be consummated.

of the event described in clause (ii), the Securities, and in each case, the
Purchase Price to be paid to Seller under this Section 5.01 shall be the

any offer to purchase Securities made by Buyer pursuant to any employee or
director option agreement or plan, any existing agreement (except the option
agreement with Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich) or a court order or regulatory
requirement shall not be subject to Seller's Put Right.

b. Buyer shall promptly (but in no event later than one day after such
event) provide notice (the "Put Notice") to Seller of the occurrence of any of
the events set forth in Section 5.01(a)(i) or (a)(ii) giving rise to the

WHEREAS, Seller and Buyer desire to amend the Purchase Agreement in the
manner described below.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby
agree as follows:

1. Amendments.
---------- 

1.01 Amendment to Section 1.02 of the Purchase Agreement.
--------------------------------------------------- 
Section 1.02 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated as
follows:

"Section 1.02. Term. This Agreement shall terminate on January 31, 1994,
------------------- 
unless earlier terminated or extended pursuant to the provisions hereof
(the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to receive the
Payment in Section 1.03, the rights set forth in Section 4.01(n), the
rights set forth in Article V and the right to indemnification in Section
7.07 shall survive any termination of this Agreement."

1.02 Amendment to Section 2.01 of the Purchase Agreement.
--------------------------------------------------- 
Section 2.01 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended to delete the
proviso set forth in (i) thereof and insert in its place the following:

"(i) If either Messr. Larry A. Mizel or Messr. David D. Mandarich
receive (x) in the case of Richmond Common Stock, consideration with a
value in excess of $1,005 per share (if such consideration is received
in the form of MDC Common Stock, then the value of such MDC Common
Stock shall be determined by using the per share price received by
Seller for its MDC common stock as determined in accordance with
(b)(2) above), then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted by adding
thereto an amount equal to the product of such excess and 1,990 or (y)
in the case of MDC Common Stock, a per share purchase price in excess
of the amount determined in accordance with (b)(2) above, then the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted by adding thereto an amount equal to
the product of such excess and 2,560,866"

22

<PAGE>

1.03 Amendment to Section 4.01(n). Section 4.01(n) is hereby amended to add to
---------------------------- 
the end of such section the following:

"In the event that Buyer consummates the purchase of Richmond Common

"Subsequent Transaction"), the obligation to adjust the Purchase Price
set forth in Section 2.01(i) hereof (the "Purchase Price Adjustment")
shall survive the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall terminate one year after the Closing Date; provided, however,
for purposes of calculating the value of the MDC Common Stock, if any,
received by Messrs. Mizel or Mandarich as consideration for such
Richmond Common Stock in any Subsequent Transaction, the per share
price determined pursuant to Section 2.01(b)(2) hereof shall be used,
provided that the term "Closing Date" used for purposes of the
calculation in Section 2.01(b)(2) shall mean the date the Subsequent
Transaction is consummated. Buyer shall immediately deliver any such
Purchase Price Adjustment to the Seller upon closing of the Subsequent
Transaction giving rise to the Purchase Price Adjustment."

2.0 GOVERNING LAW. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE TERMS

3.0 Counterparts and Terms. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
---------------------- 
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, but such
counterparts, will, together, constitute only one instrument. Capitalized
terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given
thereto in the Purchase Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly amended
pursuant to this Amendment, the Purchase Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect.
