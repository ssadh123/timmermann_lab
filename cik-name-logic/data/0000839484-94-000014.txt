Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On January 4, 1994, Jordan Industries, Inc. ("the Company"),
through its newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, J2, Inc.,
bought substantially all of the net assets of Valmark Industries,
Inc. ("Valmark"), a manufacturer of membrane switches, graphic
panel overlays, labels, and bar codes.

The purchase price of $18,016, including costs incurred directly
related to the transaction, was allocated to working capital of
$2,105, property, plant and equipment of $1,358, non-compete
agreements of $1,500, other assets of $58, and the assumption of
a long-term capital lease obligation of $4 and resulted in an
excess purchase price over net identifiable assets of $12,999. 
The acquisition was financed with the issuance of a $4,000
Subordinated Note to a former shareholder, and cash.

On May 20, 1994, the Company, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, J2, Inc., bought all of the common stock of Pamco
