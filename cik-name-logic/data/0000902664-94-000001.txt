TOYS "R" US REPORTS SALES FOR CHRISTMAS SEASON AND ELEVEN MONTHS;
MANAGEMENT CHANGES ANNOUNCED

Sales for the Christmas Season Rose 14.9% with
Comparable U.S.A. Toy Store Sales Up 7.4%

Sales for the Eleven Month Period Increased 10.8% to
$7.458 Billion

Executive Committee (Effective February 1, 1994)

PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY, January 3, 1994 -- Toys "R" Us, Inc., the
world's largest children's specialty retailing chain, today
reported that its sales for the Christmas selling season (eight
weeks ended December 25, 1993) increased 14.9% to $3.406 billion,
compared to $2.965 billion for the same period a year ago. The
Company also said that its year-to-date sales rose 10.8% to
$7.458 billion from $6.732 billion in the same period last year.

Commenting on the results, Charles Lazarus, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Toys "R" Us, stated, "Our comparable U.S.A.
toy stores sales rose 7.4% for the 1993 Christmas season and 3.5%
for the eleven months. This strong performance reflects the
continued success of our strategy of providing the best selection
of merchandise available at everyday low prices, as well as
several new marketing and merchandising initiatives implemented
this year. These include the roll-out of one of the "specialty
boutiques" within our stores, Books "R" Us, the expanded use of
our Toys "R" Us catalog and the acceleration of our Geoffrey
Helper program.

Internationally, in local currencies our comparable store sales
increased in low single digits in Canada, the United Kingdom,
France and Austria. Our German, Japanese and Spanish toy stores
experienced comparable store sales decreases. Our international
stores were adversely impacted by the recessionary environments
in those countries. We continue to be pleased with the
acceptance of our new stores throughout the world. During 1993,
we expanded our market share by opening 67 stores outside of the
United States, including stores in five new countries. In 1994,
we expect to increase our international expansion rate to over 70
new stores and open our first stores in Scandinavia.

Kids "R" Us had moderate comparable store sales increases in a
difficult apparel sales environment, continuing the third quarter
trend."
