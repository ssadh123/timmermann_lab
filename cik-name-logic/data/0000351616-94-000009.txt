One Valley Bancorp of West Virginia, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Quarter Ended March 31, 1994 and March 31, 1993

Note A. Basis of Presentation 

The accounting and reporting policies of One Valley conform to generally 
accepted accounting principles and practices in the banking industry. All 
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in 
consolidation. The interim financial information included in this report is 
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair 
presentation of the results of the interim periods have been made. Operating 
results for the three month period ended March 31, 1994 are not necessarily 
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 
31, 1994. These notes are presented in conjunction with the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report of One Valley.

Note B. Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 1994, One Valley adopted the provisions of FASB Statement 
115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." In 
accordance with the provisions of the Statement, One Valley reevaluated its 
classification of securities and assigned a portion of its securities 
investment as available-for-sale. Securities designated available-for-sale 
are presented at fair value. The corresponding unrealized gain or loss on 
these securities due to any difference between historical cost and current 
fair value is presented as component of Shareholders' Equity, net of deferred 
taxes. Securities designated as available for sale at December 31, 1993, 
approximated $632,380. The effect of adopting this Statement was to increase 
the opening balance of shareholders' equity at January 1, 1994 by $4,765, 
which was the unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale of $7,942, net 
of $3,177 in deferred income taxes. At March 31, 1994, securities available-
for-sale had an historical cost of $589,516, with an unrealized loss of 
approximately $258, which decreased shareholders' equity by $154, net of $104 
in deferred income taxes.

Note C. Mergers

On January 29, 1994, One Valley acquired all of the outstanding stock of 
Mountaineer in exchange for 4,350,000 shares of One Valley common stock. This 
combination was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, all 
prior period financial information has been restated to reflect the merging of 
the two companies as though they had always been combined.
