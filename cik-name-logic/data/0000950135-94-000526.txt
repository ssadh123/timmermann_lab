Dear Sirs:

XTRA, Inc., a Maine corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue
and sell from time to time its Series C Medium-Term Notes, each of which shall
have the benefit of an unconditional guarantee (the "Guarantee") of payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest from XTRA Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Guarantor") (the Guarantee, together with the Series C
Medium-Term Notes, the "Securities"), in an aggregate principal amount up to
$500,000,000 and agrees with each of you (individually an "Agent" and
collectively the "Agents") as set forth in this Agreement.

Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and to the
reservation by the Company of the right to sell Securities directly on its own
behalf as provided in Section 2(a) hereof, the Company and the Guarantor hereby
(i) appoint each Agent as an agent of the Company and the Guarantor for the
purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Securities from the
Company and the Guarantor pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof and (ii) agree that,
except as otherwise contemplated herein, whenever they determine to sell
Securities directly to any Agent as principal, they will enter into a separate
agreement (each a "Terms 

<PAGE> 2

Agreement"), substantially in the form of Annex I hereto, relating to
such sale in accordance with Section 2(b) hereof.

The Securities will be issued under an indenture, dated as of August
15, 1994 (the "Indenture"), between the Company, the Guarantor and The First
National Bank of Boston, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Securities shall have
the maturity ranges, annual interest rates, if any, redemption provisions and
other terms set forth in the Prospectus referred to below as it may be amended
or supplemented from time to time. The Securities will be issued, and the terms
and rights thereof established, from time to time by the Company and the
Guarantor in accordance with the Indenture and the Administrative Procedure
attached hereto as Annex II as it may be amended from time to time by written
agreement between the Agents and the Company and the Guarantor (the
"Procedure") and, if applicable, will be specified in a related Terms
Agreement.

1. The Company and the Guarantor represent and warrant to, and
agree with, each Agent that:

(a) Two registration statements on Form S-3 (Registration No.
33-43481 and No. 33-54747) have been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statements and
any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore
delivered or to be delivered to such Agent, excluding exhibits to such
registration statements but including all documents incorporated by
reference in the prospectus included in the later registration statement,
have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; no other
document with respect to such registration statements or document
incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or
transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than the prospectuses
filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the
Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), each
in the form heretofore delivered to the Agents); and no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of such registration statements has been
issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or
threatened by the Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in the
later of such registration statements or filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission
under the Act, being hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus"; the
various parts of the later of such registration statements, including all
exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the
prospectus contained in such registration statement at the time such part
of such registration statement became effective but excluding Form T-1
and, if applicable, including the information contained in the form of
final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Act, each as amended at the time such part of such registration
statement became effective, being hereinafter collectively called the
"Registration Statement"; the prospectus (including, if applicable, any
prospectus supplement) relating to the Securities, in the form in which
it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the
Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement, being hereinafter
called the "Prospectus"; any reference herein to any Preliminary
Prospectus or the Prospectus, including any supplement to the Prospectus
that sets forth only the terms of a particular issue of the Securities (a
"Pricing Supplement"), shall be deemed to refer to and include the
documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable
form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or
Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or
supplement to any Preliminary 

-2-

<PAGE> 3

Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any
documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or
Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated therein by
reference; any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement
shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company
filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the
effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement; and any reference to the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed to refer to and
include the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including by the
applicable Pricing Supplement filed in accordance with Section 4(a)
hereof) in relation to Securities sold pursuant to this Agreement, 
in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(b) under the Act and in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof,
including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date
of such filing);

(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when
they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus when such documents become effective or are
filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all
material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as
applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this
representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Guarantor and the Company by any Agent
expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate
to a particular issuance of Securities;

(c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any
further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of
the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust
Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date
as to the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the
applicable filing date as to the Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that
this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Guarantor and the Company by any Agent
expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate
to a particular issuance of Securities;

labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise
than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; and, since the
respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus, except as otherwise disclosed therein there

excess of $50 million in the consolidated long-term debt of the Guarantor
or the Company or any material adverse change, or any development
involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the
general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or
results of operations of the Guarantor or the Company and their
respective subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in
the Prospectus;

(e) The Guarantor and the Company and their respective subsidiaries
have good and marketable title to all personal property owned by either
of them, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and
defects except such as are described or referred to in the Prospectus or
such as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not
interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by
the Company or the Guarantor and their respective subsidiaries; and any
real property and buildings held under lease by the Guarantor or the
Company and their respective subsidiaries are held by them under valid,

subsidiaries;

(f) Each of the Guarantor and the Company has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware and Maine, respectively, with
power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and
conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and neither is
required to be qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of
business under the laws of any jurisdictions in which the consequences of
a failure to qualify, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
material adverse effect on the business of the Guarantor, the Company and
their respective subsidiaries (taken as a whole); and each subsidiary of
the Guarantor or the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has been duly qualified as a foreign
corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under
the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases
properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification
and in which the consequences of a failure to so qualify would have a
material adverse effect on the business of the Guarantor, the Company and
their respective subsidiaries (taken as a whole);

(g) The Guarantor and the Company each has an authorized

set forth in the Prospectus) are owned directly by the Guarantor or
indirectly through one or more of its subsidiaries, free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;

(h) The Securities have been duly authorized, and, when issued and
delivered pursuant to the Indenture and this Agreement and any Terms
Agreement, will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and

agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor or any of its
subsidiaries, including the Company, is a party or by which the Guarantor
or any of its subsidiaries, including the Company, is bound, nor (y) will

subsidiaries, including the Company, is subject (other than as set forth
or contemplated in the Prospectus and other than litigation incident to
the kind of business conducted by the Guarantor and its subsidiaries,
including the Company), which, if determined adversely to the Guarantor
and its subsidiaries, including the Company, would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position, stockholders' equity or annual results of operations of the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including the Company (taken as a whole);
and, to the best of the Guarantor's knowledge, no such proceedings are

the Company and the Guarantor resulting from solicitation by the Agents
hereunder and immediately after any Time of Delivery, as defined in
Section 2(b), relating to a sale under a Terms Agreement, the aggregate
amount of Securities which shall have been issued and sold by the Company
and the Guarantor hereunder or under any Terms Agreement and of any debt
securities of the Company or guarantees of the Guarantor (other than such
Securities) that shall have been issued and sold pursuant to the
Registration Statement will not exceed the amount of debt securities or
guarantees, as the case may be, registered under the Registration
Statement or registered under the earlier registration statement
(Registration No. 33-43481) referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section
to which the Prospectus also relates pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act.

2. (a) On the basis of the representations and warranties herein
contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each of
the Agents hereby severally and not jointly agrees, as agent of the Company and
the Guarantor, to use its reasonable efforts when requested by the Company to
solicit and receive offers to purchase the Securities from the Company upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented
from time to time. So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, neither
the Company nor the Guarantor shall, without the consent of the Agents, solicit
or accept offers to purchase, or sell or guarantee, any debt securities with a
maturity at the time of original issuance greater than or equal to 9 months and
less than or equal to 30 years, except as contemplated hereby or in any Terms
Agreement. The Guarantor and the Company may, subject to Section 1(d), enter
into any revolving credit and/or term loan agreements with commercial banking
institutions and loans from insurance companies (provided that such loans shall
not consist of Securities). The Company reserves the right to sell, and may
solicit and accept offers to purchase, Securities directly on its own behalf;
provided, however, that if at the time of any such sales the Agents are posting
terms and conditions for the purchase and sale of the Securities, such sales
shall be on substantially the same terms and conditions as then posted by the
Agents; provided further, that in the case of any such sales not resulting from
a solicitation made by any Agent, no commission shall be payable with respect
to such sales. Each Agent also acknowledges and agrees that the Company may
accept (but not solicit) offers to purchase Securities through additional
agents, and may appoint another

-6-
<PAGE> 7

agent, or agents, to solicit offers to purchase the Notes, provided that such
additional agent or agents shall be engaged on terms substantially similar to
the applicable terms of this Agreement (except that commissions payable to such
agent or agents shall be identical to those set forth in the commission
schedule in this Section 2(a)).

The Company and the Guarantor reserve the right, in their sole
discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of
time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities. As
soon as practicable, but in any event not later than one business day in New
York City after receipt of notice from the Company and the Guarantor, the
Agents will suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities from the
Company and the Guarantor until such time as the Company and the Guarantor have
advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.

<TABLE>
The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, at the time of
settlement of any sale of a Security by the Company and the Guarantor as a
result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount equal to the
following applicable percentage of the principal amount of such Security sold:

Each of the Agents is authorized to solicit offers to purchase the
Securities only in denominations of $100,000 or any amount in excess thereof
that is an integral multiple of $1,000 at a purchase price equal to 100% of
their principal amount. Each Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or
in writing, each reasonable offer to purchase Securities received by it as
Agent other than those rejected by such Agent. The Company shall have the sole
right to accept offers to purchase Securities and may reject any proposed
purchase of Securities as a whole or in part. Each Agent shall have the right,
in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any offer received by it to
purchase Securities, as a whole or in part, and any such rejection by it shall
not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein.

(b) Each sale of Securities to any Agent as principal shall be made
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (unless the Company and such
Agent shall otherwise agree) a Terms Agreement which will provide for the sale
of such Securities to, and the purchase thereof by, such Agent. A Terms
Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of
such Securities by such Agent. The commitment of any Agent to purchase
Securities pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on
the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Guarantor herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions
herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of
Securities to be purchased by any Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid
to the Company for such Securities, any provisions relating to rights of, and
default by, underwriters acting together with such Agent in the reoffering of
the Securities and the time and date and place of delivery of and payment for
such Securities. Such Terms Agreement shall also specify any requirements for
opinions of counsel, accountants' letters and officers' certificates pursuant
to Section 4 hereof.

For each sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not
made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company agrees to pay such Agent a
commission (or grant an equivalent discount) as provided in Section 2(a) hereof
and in accordance with the schedule set forth therein.

Each time and date of delivery of and payment for Securities to be
purchased by an Agent as principal, whether set forth in a Terms Agreement or
in accordance with the Procedure, is referred to herein as a "Time of
Delivery".

(c) Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of
Securities, the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities and the payment
in each case therefor shall be as set forth in the Procedure. The provisions of
the Procedure shall apply to all transactions contemplated hereunder other than
those made pursuant to a Terms Agreement. Each Agent, the Guarantor and the
Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically
provided to be performed by each of them in the Procedure. The Company and the
Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Procedure as from time to
time in effect.

3. The documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6
hereof on the Commencement Date (as defined below) shall be delivered to the
Agents at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell, 250 Park Avenue, New York, New
York, at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of this Agreement, which
date and time of such delivery may be postponed by agreement between the Agents
and the Company and the Guarantor but in no event shall be later than the day
prior to the date on which solicitation of offers to purchase Securities is

-8-
<PAGE> 9

commenced or on which any Terms Agreement is executed (such time and date being
referred to herein as the "Commencement Date").

4. The Company and the Guarantor covenant and agree with each Agent:

(a) (i) To prepare the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented, in
a form approved by such Agent and (A) to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule
424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the
second business day following the acceptance of an offer to purchase a Security
(as described in the Procedure pursuant to Section 2(c) of this Agreement) or
(B) to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later
than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following
the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement relating to the Purchased
Securities (as defined therein); (ii) to make no amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus (A) prior to the Commencement Date
which shall be disapproved by any Agent promptly after reasonable notice
thereof or (B) after the date of any Terms Agreement or other agreement by an
Agent to purchase Securities as principal and prior to the related Time of
Delivery which shall be disapproved by any Agent party to such Terms Agreement
or so purchasing as principal promptly after reasonable notice thereof, in each
case such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (iii) to make no
such amendment or supplement, other than a Pricing Supplement, at any other
time prior to having afforded each Agent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon; (iv) to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or
information statements required to be filed by the Guarantor or the Company
with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in
connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such same
period to advise such Agent, promptly after the Guarantor or the Company
receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration
Statement has been filed or has become effective or any supplement to the
Prospectus or any amended Prospectus (other than any Pricing Supplement that
relates to Securities not purchased through or by such Agent) has been filed
with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of
any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the
Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the

event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended
or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in

in reports furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission but
including such detail concerning the business and financial condition of the
Company and its subsidiaries as the Agents may reasonably request);

business days prior to the date of such letter; provided, however, that, with
respect to any financial information or other matter, such letter may reconfirm

operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including the Company,
otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) 
or (ii), is in the judgment of the Agents so material and adverse as to make 
it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation by the 
Agents of offers to purchase Securities from the Guarantor and the Company 
or the purchase by the Agents of Securities from the Guarantor and the 
Company as principal, as the case may be;

(g) There shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a
suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New
York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities
in New York declared by either federal or New York State authorities; (iii) the
outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the
declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war if the effect
of any such event specified in this clause (iii) in the judgment of the Agents
makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the solicitation of
offers to purchase Securities or the purchase of Securities from the Guarantor
and the Company as principal pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement, as the
case may be; or (iv) any downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's debt
securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as
that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the
Act; or (v) any such "nationally recognized statistical rating organization"
shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with
possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt
securities; and

(h) The Guarantor and the Company shall have furnished or caused to
be furnished to such Agent certificates of officers of the Guarantor and the
Company dated the Commencement Date and each applicable date referred to in
Section 4(k) that is on or prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery,
as the case may be, in such form and executed by such officers of the Guarantor
and the Company as shall be satisfactory to such Agent, as to the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Guarantor and the Company herein at
and as of the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, as
to the performance by the Guarantor and the Company of all of its obligations
hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Commencement Date or such
applicable date, as the case may be, as to the matters set forth in subsections
(a) and (f) of this Section 6, and as to such other matters as such Agent may
reasonably request.

7. (a) The Guarantor and the Company will, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under
the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the
Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and will reimburse such Agent for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim as

-19-
<PAGE> 20

such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Guarantor and Company
shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any
Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the
Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor and Company by
any such Agent expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

(b) Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Guarantor and
the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the
Guarantor and the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each
case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any
Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the
Securities, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor and the Company
by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Guarantor and
the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the
Guarantor and the Company in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection
(a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such
action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not,
except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the
indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such
subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in
each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified

-20-
<PAGE> 21

party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Guarantor and the Company on the one hand and each
Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss,
claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however,
the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted
by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice
required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but
also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Company on the one hand and
each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Guarantor and the Company on the one hand and each
Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total
net proceeds from the sale of Securities (before deducting expenses) received
by the Company bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such
Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the
Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. The Guarantor and the Company and each Agent
agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
subsection (d) were determined by per capita allocation (even if the Agents
were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to
include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Agent shall not be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
public offering price of the Securities purchased by or through it exceeds the
amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of
each of the Agents under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in
proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such
loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are
not joint.

(e) The obligations of the Guarantor and the Company under this
Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Guarantor and the
Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning
of the Act; and the obligations of each Agent under this Section 7 shall be in
addition to any liability which such Agent may otherwise have and shall extend,
upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the
Guarantor and the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the
Guarantor or the Company within the meaning of the Act.

-21-
<PAGE> 22

8. Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Securities from the
Company and the Guarantor and in performing the other obligations of such Agent
hereunder (other than in respect of any Terms Agreement), is acting solely as
agent for the Company and the Guarantor and not as principal. Each Agent will
make reasonable efforts to assist the Company and the Guarantor in obtaining
performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the
Company and the Guarantor was solicited by such Agent and has been accepted by
the Company and the Guarantor, but such Agent shall not have any liability to
the Company and the Guarantor in the event such purchase is not consummated for
any reason. If the Company or the Guarantor shall default on its obligation to
deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company and
the Guarantor shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or
damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and the
Guarantor and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to the Agent that
solicited such offer any commission to which it would be entitled in connection
with such sale. The Company and the Guarantor shall not be required to pay any
Agent a commission in connection with any purchase of a Security which is not
consummated other than as a result of a default by the Company or the Guarantor
of its obligations hereunder, including their obligation to deliver Securities
to a purchaser whose offer has been accepted.

9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations,
warranties and other statements by any Agent and the Guarantor and the Company
set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results
thereof) made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any
Agent or the Guarantor or the Company, or any officer or director or any
controlling person of the Guarantor or the Company, and shall survive each
delivery of and payment for any of the Securities.

10. The provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation
of offers to purchase Securities from the Company and the Guarantor may be
suspended or terminated at any time by the Company and the Guarantor as to any
Agent or by any Agent as to such Agent upon the giving of written notice of
such suspension or termination to such Agent or the Company or the Guarantor,
as the case may be. In the event of such suspension or termination with respect
to any Agent, (x) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to any Agent as to which such suspension or termination has not
occurred, (y) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect
to the rights and obligations of any party which have previously accrued or
which relate to Securities which are already issued, agreed to be issued or the
subject of a pending offer at the time of such suspension or termination and
(z) in any event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect insofar
as the third paragraph of Section 2(a) (with respect to solicitations made
prior to such suspension or termination), Section 4(d), Section 4(e), Section 5
(with respect to solicitations made prior to such suspension or termination),
Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 are concerned.

11. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the
Procedure, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in
writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to Goldman,
Sachs & Co. shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by
facsimile transmission or registered mail to 85 Broad Street, New York, New

12. This Agreement and any Terms Agreement shall be binding upon,
and inure solely to the benefit of, each Agent and the Company and the
Guarantor, and to the extent provided in Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9
hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and any
person who controls any Agent or the Company or the Guarantor, and their
respective personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other
person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or
any Terms Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities through or from any
Agent hereunder shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such
purchase.

13. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement and any Terms
Agreement. As used herein the term "business day" shall mean any day when the
Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.

14. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY TERMS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, but all of such respective counterparts
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE
MEDIUM-TERM NOTES
SERIES C

Medium-term notes, each of which has the benefit of an unconditional
guarantee (the "Guarantee") of payment of principal, premium (if any) and
interest from XTRA Corporation (the medium-term notes, together with the
Guarantee being referred to herein as the "Securities") in the aggregate
principal amount of up to $500,000,000 are to be offered from time to time by
XTRA, Inc. (the "Company") and XTRA Corporation (the "Guarantor"), through
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Smith Barney Inc. and Wertheim Schroder & Co.
Incorporated as agents of the Company and the Guarantor (in such capacity,
individually an "Agent" and collectively the "Agents"). Each Agent has agreed
to use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase Securities directly
from the Company and the Guarantor, and each such Agent may also purchase
Securities from the Company and the Guarantor as principal. The Securities are
being sold pursuant to a Distribution Agreement, dated August 15, 1994 (the
"Distribution Agreement"), between the Company and the Guarantor and the
Agents, to which this Administrative Procedure is attached as Annex II.

The Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of
August 15, 1994 (the "Indenture"), between the Company, the Guarantor and The
First National Bank of Boston, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Securities will
have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission").

In the case of purchases of Securities by any Agent as principal,
the relevant terms and settlement details related thereto, including the Time
of Delivery referred to in Section 2(b), will be set forth in a Terms Agreement
entered into between such Agent and the Company and the Guarantor pursuant to
the Distribution Agreement, unless the Company and such Agent otherwise agree
as provided in Section 2(b) of the Distribution Agreement, in which case the
procedures to be followed in respect of the settlement of such sale will be as
set forth below.

The procedures to be followed during, and the specific terms of, the
solicitation of offers by the Agents and the sale as a result thereof by the
Company are explained below. The following summaries of certain provisions of
the Distribution Agreement and the Indenture do not purport to be complete and
are subject, and are qualified in their entirety by reference, to all of the
respective provisions of the Distribution Agreement and the Indenture.

Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be handled
for the Company by its Controllers Department. The Company will advise the
Agents in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities
("Designated Persons") with whom the Agents are to communicate regarding offers
to purchase Securities and the details of their delivery.

II-1
<PAGE> 31
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Maturities: Each Security will mature on a date, selected by the purchaser and agreed to by the Company, which
will be at least nine months but not more than thirty years from the date of issuance.

Guarantee: Each Security will have the benefit of a Guarantee.

Price to Public: Each Security will be issued at 100% of its principal amount.

Denominations: The denominations will be $100,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Global
Securities (as defined below) will be denominated in principal amounts not in excess of
$150,000,000. If one or more Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$150,000,000 would, but for the preceding sentence, be represented by a single Global Security,
then one Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent each $150,000,000
principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes and an additional Global Security will be
authenticated and issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or
Notes. In such a case, each of the Global Securities representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes
shall be assigned the same CUSIP number.

Registration: Each Security will be issued only in fully registered form and will be represented by either a
global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The Depository
Trust Company (the "Depository") and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the
Depository (a "Book-Entry Security") or a certificate issued in definitive form (a
"Certificated Security") delivered to a person designated by an Agent, as set forth in the
applicable Pricing Supplement. An owner of a Book-Entry Security will not be entitled to
receive a certificate representing such a Security, except as provided in the Indenture.

Each Global Security will be registered in the name of CEDE & Co., as nominee for DTC, on the
Security Register. The beneficial owner of a Book-Entry Note (or one or more indirect
participants in DTC designated by such owner) will designate one or more direct participants in
DTC (with respect to such Note, the "Participants") to act as agent or agents for such owner in
connection with the book-entry system maintained by DTC, and DTC will record in book-entry
form, in accordance with instructions provided by such Participants, a credit balance with
respect to such beneficial owner in such Note in the account of such Participants. The
ownership interest of such beneficial owner in such Note will be recorded through the records
of such Participants or through the separate
</TABLE>

II-2
<PAGE> 32
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
records of such Participants and one or more indirect participants in DTC.

Identification The Company has arranged with the CUSIP Service Bureau of
Numbers: Standard & Poor's Corporation (the "CUSIP Service Bureau") for the reservation of a series of
CUSIP numbers (including tranche numbers) for the Registered Notes. Such series consists of
approximately 900 CUSIP numbers and relates to Global Securities representing Book-Entry Notes
and book- entry medium-term notes issued by the Company with other series designations. The
Company has obtained from the CUSIP Service Bureau written lists of such reserved CUSIP
numbers, and caused such lists to be delivered to the DTC Agent and to DTC. The Company will
assign CUSIP numbers to Global Securities as described below under Settlement Procedure "A".
DTC will notify the CUSIP Service Bureau periodically of the CUSIP numbers that the Company has
assigned to Global securities. The DTC Agent will notify the Company at any time when fewer
than 100 of the reserved CUSIP numbers remain unassigned to Global Securities, and, if it deems
necessary, the Company will reserve additional CUSIP numbers for assignment to Global
Securities. Upon obtaining such additional CUSIP numbers, the Company shall deliver a list of
such additional CUSIP numbers to the DTC Agent and to DTC.

Interest Payments: Interest payments will be made, with respect to fixed-rate Securities, on each April 1 and October
1 in each year and, with respect to floating-rate Securities, on the dates specified therein
(in each case, the "Interest Payment Dates"), commencing on the first Interest Payment Date
after the Settlement Date (as defined below under "Settlement"), and at maturity. Interest
payments will be made on the Interest Payment Dates to the registered owners of fixed-rate
Securities, at the close of business on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15
record dates, respectively; interest payments will be made on the Interest Payment Dates to the
registered owners of floating-rate Securities on the record dates occurring 15 days prior to
each Interest Payment Date. Interest will begin to accrue on the Settlement Date, as hereafter
defined, and not from the immediately previous Interest Payment Date. Interest payable at
maturity (other than on a date which is an Interest Payment Date) will be paid to the same
person to whom the principal is payable. Interest (including payments for partial periods) will
be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Unless special
arrangements have been made, all interest payments (other than interest due at maturity) will
be made by check, drawn on The First National Bank of Boston.
</TABLE>

II-3
<PAGE> 33
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
On the fifth business day immediately preceding each Interest Payment Date, the Trustee will
advise the Company of the aggregate amount of interest to be paid on the Securities on such
Interest Payment Date. The Trustee will provide monthly to the Guarantor's and the Company's
Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer a list of the principal and interest to be paid on Securities
maturing in the next succeeding month. The Trustee will assume responsibility for withholding
taxes on interest paid as required by law.

Acceptance of The Agents will promptly advise the Company by telephone or
Offers: other appropriate means of all reasonable offers to purchase securities, other than those
rejected by the Agents. The Company shall inform the Guarantor of any such offers. The Agents
may, in their discretion reasonably exercised, reject any offer received by them in whole or in
part. The Company and the Guarantor will have the sole right to accept offers to purchase
Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in part.

If the Company and the Guarantor accept an offer to purchase Securities, they will confirm such
acceptance in writing to the Agents and the Trustee or its agent. If the Company and the
Guarantor reject an offer, they will promptly notify the Agents.

If the Company and the Guarantor accept an offer to purchase a Security (as described below under
"Procedure for Posting"), but the Company has not "posted" rates, the Company will prepare a
pricing sticker reflecting the terms of such Security and will arrange to have ten stickered

If a sale is to be settled more than one Business Day after the sale date, Settlement Procedures
"A" and "B" shall be completed as soon as practicable but not later than 2:00 p.m. on the first
Business Day after the sale date. If the initial interest rate for a Floating Rate Book-Entry
Security has not been determined at the time that the Sale Information is communicated,
Settlement Procedures "A" and "B" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined
but no later than 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day before the settlement date. Settlement
Procedure "G" is subject to extension in accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing
deadlines and in the other events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the
settlement date.

If settlement of a Book-Entry Security is rescheduled or cancelled, the Trustee, upon obtaining
knowledge thereof, will deliver to the Depository, through the Depository's Participation
Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the
Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled settlement date.

Failures in Respect If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to Book-Entry Security pursuant 
of Book-Entry to Settlement Procedure "E", the Trustee may deliver to the Depository, through the Deposi-
Securities: tory's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing the
Depository to debit such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account, provided
that the Trustee's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security
representing such Book-Entry Security that is at least equal to the principal amount to be
debited. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all the Book-Entry Securities
represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will mark such Global Security "cancelled", make
appropriate entries in the Trustee's records and send such cancelled Global Security to the
Company. The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with CUSIP
Service Bureau procedures, be cancelled and not immediately reassigned. If a withdrawal message
is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities represented
by a Global Security, the Trustee will exchange such Global Security for two Global Securities,
one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Security or Securities and shall be cancelled
immediately after

</TABLE>

II-11
<PAGE> 41
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
issuance and the other of which shall represent the remaining Book-Entry securities previously
represented by the surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the
surrendered Global Security.

If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Security is not timely paid to the participants with
respect to such Book-Entry Security by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a person including
an indirect participant in the Depository, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such
participants and, in turn, the Agent for such Book-Entry Security may enter deliver orders
through the Depository's Participant Terminal System debiting such Book-Entry Security to such
participant's account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's account and then
debiting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's participant account and crediting such Book-
Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account and shall notify the Company and the
Trustee thereof. Thereafter, the Trustee will (i) immediately notify the Company of such order
and the Company shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use in an amount
equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security which was credited to the account of the company
maintained at the Trustee in accordance with Settlement Procedure I, and (ii) deliver the
withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph. If such
failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable Agent to
perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will
reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use of funds during the period
when the funds were credited to the account of the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Book-Entry Security,
the Depository may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in
effect. In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the
Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will provide,
in accordance with Settlement Procedure "D" for the authentication and issuance of a Global
Security representing the other Book-Entry Securities to have been represented by such Global
Security and will make appropriate entries in its records. The Company will, from time to time,
furnish the Trustee with a sufficient quantity of Securities.

Posting: Company and the Guarantor and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of interest
per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Securities that may be sold as a result of the
solicitation of offers by the Agents. Once a decision has been reached to set initially the
"posted" rates or to change already "posted" rates, the Company or the Guarantor will promptly
advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers until the initial or changed "posted" rates
have been established. When such rates have been established, the Company will then promptly
prepare "posted" rates stickers reflecting such posted rates and maturities. The Company will
then promptly arrange to have ten Prospectus Supplements so stickered filed with the Commission
not later than the Commissioner's close of business on the second business day after such
"posted" rates have been established and to have copies of such stickered Prospectus
Supplements delivered to the Agents.

"Posting" rates shall mean establishing a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an

<PAGE> 43
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
the Agents will suspend solicitation until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that
solicitation of offers to purchase Securities may be resumed. Except as otherwise provided for
in the Distribution Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor have discretion regarding whether
to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or Prospectus. If the Company or the
Guarantor proposes so to amend or supplement, it will promptly advise the Agents and will
furnish the Agents such proposed amendment or supplement and, after the Agents has been
afforded a reasonable opportunity to review such amendment or supplement, will cause such
amendment or supplement promptly to be filed with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission. The
Company will promptly provide the Agents with copies of any such amendment or supplement and
confirm to the Agents that such amendment or supplement has been filed with the Commission.

In the event that at the time the Agents suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Securities
there shall be any orders for delayed settlement out-standing, the Company and the Guarantor,
consistent with their obligations under the Distribution Agreement, promptly will advise the
Agents whether such orders may be settled and whether copies of the Prospectus as in effect at
the time of the suspension may be delivered in connection with the settlement of such orders.
The Company and the Guarantor will have the sole responsibility for such decision and for any
arrangements which may be made in the event that the Company or the Guarantor deter-mines that
such orders may not be settled or that copies of such Prospectus may not be so delivered.

Authenticity The Company will cause the Trustee to furnish the Agents from time to time with the specimen
of Signatures: signatures of each of the Trustee's officers, employees or agents who have been authorized 
by the Trustee to authenticate Securities, but the Agents will have no obligation
or liability to the Company or the Trustee or its agent in respect of the authenticity of the
signature of any officer, employee or agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee or
its agent on any Security.

Advertising The Company and the Guarantor will determine upon consultation with the Agents the amount of
advertising that may be appropriate in the solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities.
Advertising expenses will be paid by the Company and the Guarantor.

ANNEX III

Pursuant to Section 4(j) and Section 6(e), as the case may be, of
the Distribution Agreement, the Guarantor's independent certified public
accountants shall furnish letters to the effect that:

(i) They are independent certified public accountants with
respect to the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including the Company,
within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and
regulations thereunder;

(ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and financial
statement schedules audited by them and included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published
rules and regulations thereunder;

(iii) They have performed the procedures specified by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of
interim financial information as described in SAS No. 71 on the unaudited
financial statements included in the Guarantor's Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and inquired of
certain officials of the Guarantor who have responsibility for financial
and accounting matters as to whether the unaudited financial statements
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the
related published rules and regulations, and based on the foregoing
procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe
that any material modifications should be made to the unaudited financial
statements for them to be in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, or that the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the
related published rules and regulations;

(iv) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an
audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements, a reading
of the latest available interim financial statements of the Guarantor and
its subsidiaries, including the Company, inspection of the minute books
of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including the Company, since the
date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated
by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Guarantor
and its subsidiaries, including the Company, responsible for financial
and accounting matters, nothing came to their attention that caused them
to believe that:

(A) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to
the date of such letter, there has been any increase in the
consolidated long-term debt of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries,
including the Company, or any decrease in the amount of the
Guarantor's retained earnings, or any decreases in common stock,
consolidated net property and equipment or lease contracts
receivable in each case as compared with amounts shown on the most
recently filed Form 10-Q, except in each case for changes, increases
or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may
occur or which are described in such letter; and

III-1
<PAGE> 45

(B) for the period from the date of the latest financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
to the specified date referred to in Clause (A) there were any
decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the
preceding year, in the amount of the Guarantor's consolidated
revenues, or income from operations before provision for income
taxes or any decreases in the ratio of income from operations before
provision for income taxes to revenues, or any increases in the
ratios of depreciation on rental equipment, rental equipment
operating expense (which includes repair, and maintenance, tires and
tubes, transportation and storage, facilities and other expense),
selling and administrative expense or interest expense to revenues,
except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus
discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such
letter;

(v) In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s)
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited
procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures
referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above, they have carried out
certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain
amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Agents
which are derived from the general accounting records of the Guarantor
and its subsidiaries, including the Company, which appear in the
Prospectus (including documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II
of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified
by the Agents or in documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
specified by the Agents, and have compared certain of such amounts,
percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including the Company, and have found
them to be in agreement;

(vi) They compared the amounts included in the Selected
Financial Data to the appropriate annual reports on Form 10-K and found
them to be in agreement. They have also compared the amounts included in
the selected quarterly financial data to the Company's accounting
records, the appropriate Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or the appropriate
Form 10-K, and found them to be in agreement. They compared the
information included in the Selected Financial Data, the Selected
Quarterly Financial Data and the Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges and 
Earnings to Combined Fixed Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends tables 
with the requirements of Items 301 or 302 or 503, respectively, of 
Regulation S-K. They also inquired of certain officials of the Guarantor 
who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether 
this information conforms in all material respects with the disclosure 
requirements of Items 301 or 302 or 503, respectively, of Regulation S-K.
Nothing came to their attention to cause them to believe that the 
Selected Financial Data, the Selected Quarterly Financial Data and 
Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Earnings to Combined Fixed 
Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends did not conform in all material 
respects to the disclosure requirements of Rule 301 or 302 or 503, 
respectively, of Regulation S-K; and

(vii) If pro forma financial information is required to be
included in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus, they have

(A) read the unaudited pro forma balance sheet and the
unaudited pro forma statements of income included in or incorporated
by reference into the Registration Statement or Prospectus;

III-2
<PAGE> 46

(B) inquired of certain officials of the Guarantor (and the
company being acquired) who have responsibility for financial and
accounting matters about (1) the basis for such officials'
determination of the pro forma adjustments; and (2) whether the
unaudited pro forma financial statements referred to above comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X; and

(C) proved the arithmetic accuracy of the application of the
pro forma adjustments to the historical amounts in the unaudited pro
forma financial statements.

The foregoing procedures are substantially less in scope than an
examination, the object of which is the expression of an opinion on
management's assumptions, the pro forma adjustments and the application of
those adjustments to historical financial information. Accordingly, they make
no representation about the sufficiency of such procedures for each Agent's
purposes.

Nothing came to their attention as a result of the procedures
specified in the above paragraphs, however, that caused them to believe that
the unaudited pro forma financial statements referred to above included in or
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus do
not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X and that the pro forma adjustments
have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of
those statements. Had they performed additional procedures or had they made an
examination of the pro forma financial statements, other matters might have
come to their attention that would have been reported to the Agents.

All references in this Annex III to the Prospectus shall be deemed
to refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference
therein) as defined in the Distribution Agreement as of the Commencement Date
referred to in Section 6(e) thereof and to the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as of
the date of the amendment, supplement, incorporation or the Time of Delivery
relating to the Terms Agreement requiring the delivery of such letter under
Section 4(j) thereof.

reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or
representations with respect to the matters upon which his
certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such
certificate or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it
relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or
representations by, an officer or officers of the Company or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, stating that the information with
respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the
Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such counsel

Section 1.4 Acts of Holders; Record Dates.
------------------------------

-12-

<PAGE> 19

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied
in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially
similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent
duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such
instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where
it is hereby expressly required, to the Company and the
Guarantor. Such instrument or instruments (and the action
embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes
referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument
or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of
a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any
purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.1) conclusive
in favor of the Trustee and the Company and the Guarantor, if
made in the manner provided in this Section.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any
Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by
the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate
of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take
acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing
such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution
thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a
capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or
affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his
authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such
instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing
the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the
Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the
Security Register.

(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall
bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of
every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof
or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything
done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, the Company
or the Guarantor in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of
such action is made upon such Security or such other Security.

(e) The Company may set any day as a record date for the
purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of
any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or
taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the

-13-

<PAGE> 20

Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this
paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making
of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in
the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this
paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant
series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be
entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders
remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such
action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to
the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite
principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such
record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action
for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this
paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall
automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and
of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the
requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the
relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after
any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company,
at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the
proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to
be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of
Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in
Section 1.6.

The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose
of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any
series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice
of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in
Section 5.2, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred
to in Section 5.7(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section
5.12, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If
any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of
Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no
other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice,
declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders
remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such
action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to
the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite
principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such
record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action
for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this
paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall
automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and
of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the
requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the

-14-

<PAGE> 21

relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after
any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee,
at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date,
the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date
to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of
Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in
Section 1.6.

With respect to any record date set pursuant to this
Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may
designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time
may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day;
provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of
the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party
hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the
relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 1.6, on or
prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is
not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to
this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall
be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such
record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject
to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this
paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date
shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record
date.

Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder
to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular
Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the
principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly
appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such
appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal
amount.

(f) The Depositary selected pursuant to subsection (17) of
Section 3.1, as a Holder, may appoint agents and otherwise
authorize participants to give, make or take any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
which a Holder is entitled to give or take hereunder.

Section 1.5 Notices, Etc., to Trustee, Company or Guarantor.
------------------------------------------------

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or
permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished
to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder, the Company or the
Guarantor shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder

-15-

<PAGE> 22

if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with
the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or

(2) the Company or the Guarantor by the Trustee or
by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose
hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if
in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
the Company or the Guarantor as the case requires
addressed to it at the address of its principal office
specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at
any other address previously furnished in writing to the
Trustee by the Company or the Guarantor.

Section 1.6 Notice to Holders; Waiver.
--------------------------

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of
any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless
otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed,
first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such
event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not
later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the
earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice.
In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the
failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so
mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of
such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture
provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in
writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either
before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the
equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be
filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition
precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon
such waiver.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail
service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable
to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be
made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a
sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Section 1.7 Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.
----------------------------------

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts
with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required
under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the
latter provision shall control. If any provision of this
Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust
Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter
provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so
modified or excluded, as the case may be.

Securities or in the Guarantees shall be invalid, illegal or

thereby.

Guarantees, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the
Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under this Indenture.

Section 1.12 Governing Law.
--------------

This Indenture, the Securities and the Guarantees shall

State of New York.

provision of this Indenture or of the Securities other than a
provision of any Security which specifically states that such
provision shall apply in lieu of this Section) payment of
interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at
such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same

GUARANTEE

For value received, XTRA Corporation, a corporation

Guarantee is endorsed), hereby unconditionally guarantees to the
Holder of the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed and
to the Trustee on behalf of each such Holder the due and punctual
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
such Security, when and as the same shall become due and payable,
whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration,

and of the Indenture referred to therein. In case of the failure
of XTRA, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Maine
(herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor

Stated Maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for
redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the
Company.

The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations
hereunder shall be as if it were principal debtor and not merely
surety, and shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of,

unenforceability of such Security or such Indenture, any failure
to enforce the provisions of such Security or such Indenture, or
any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company
with respect thereto, by the holder of such Security or the
Trustee or any other circumstance which may otherwise constitute

-19-

<PAGE> 26

a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the consent of
the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of such Security,
change the redemption terms thereof or alter the Stated Maturity
thereof. The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of
merger or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a
proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with
respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby
and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee
will not be discharged except by strict and complete performance
of the obligations contained in such Security and this Guarantee.

The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Holder of such Security and the Trustee against the Company in
respect of any amounts paid to such Holder by the Guarantor
pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or to
receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of
subrogation until the principal of, premium if any, and interest
on all Securities issued under such Indenture shall have been
paid in full.

No reference herein to such Indenture and no provision of
this Guarantee or of such Indenture shall alter or impair the
guarantee of the Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional,
of the due and punctual payment of principal, premium (if any),
and interest on the Security upon which this Guarantee is
endorsed.

This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any
purpose until the certificate of authentication of the Security
upon which this Guarantee is endorsed shall have been manually
executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under such Indenture.

All terms used in this Guarantee which are defined in
such Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in such
Indenture.

This Guarantee shall be deemed to be a contract made
under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York.

adoption and applicability to such Securities of any terms
and conditions similar to those contained in Section 13.2
and/or Section 13.3; and, if other than by a Board
Resolution, the manner in which any election by the Company
to defease such Securities shall be evidenced;

(16) the issuance of a temporary global Security
representing all of the Securities of such series and
exchange of such temporary global Security for definitive
Securities of such series;

(17) whether the Securities of the series shall be
issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global
Securities and, in such case, the Depositary for such Global
Security or Securities, the form of any legend or legends
which shall be borne by any such Global Security in addition
to or in lieu of that set forth in Section 2.4 and any
circumstances in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in
Clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 3.5 in which any
such Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part
for Securities registered, and any transfer of such Global
Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name
or names of Persons other than the Depositary for such

-24-

<PAGE> 31

(20) any other terms of the series (which terms shall

except as permitted by Section 9.1(5).

All Securities of any one series shall be substantially
identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise
be provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to
above and (subject to Section 3.3) set forth or determined in the
manner provided in the Officer's Certificate referred to above or
in any such indenture supplemental hereto.

If any of the terms of the series are established by action
taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate
record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee
at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting
forth the terms of the series.

Section 3.2 Denominations.
--------------

The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in
registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as
shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1. In the
absence of any such specified denominations with respect to the
Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be
issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple
thereof.

Section 3.3 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
-----------------------------------------------

The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by
its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice
Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested
by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The
signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be
manual or facsimile.

Securities or Guarantees bearing the manual or facsimile
signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper offi-
cers of the Company or the Guarantor shall bind the Company and
the Guarantor, respectively, notwithstanding that such
individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior
to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or
Guarantees or did not hold such offices at the date of such
Securities or Guarantees.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of
any series executed by the Company having endorsed thereon
Guarantees of the Guarantor to the Trustee for authentication,

-25-

<PAGE> 32

together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery
of such Securities and a Company Order from the Guarantor
approving the delivery of the Guarantees endorsed thereon; and
the Trustee in accordance with such Company Orders shall
authenticate and deliver such Securities having such Guarantees
endorsed thereon. If the form or terms of the Securities or the
Guarantees or both of the series have been established in or
pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by
Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and
accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in
relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to
receive, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in
relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,

(a) if the form of any of such Securities and
Guarantees has been established by or pursuant to Board
Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form has
been established in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture;

(b) if the terms of any of such Securities and
Guarantees have been established by or pursuant to Board
Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have
been established in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture; and

(c) that such Securities and Guarantees, when
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the
Company in the manner and subject to any conditions
specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid
and legally binding obligations of the Company and of the
Guarantor, respectively, enforceable in accordance with
their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to general equity principles.

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall
not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of
such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will adversely affect
the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the
Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is
not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the
preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be
originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to
deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to
Section 3.1 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise
required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the

-26-

<PAGE> 33

time of authentication of each Security of such series if such
documents are delivered at or prior to the time of authentication
upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be
issued.

Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

No Security or Guarantee endorsed thereon shall be entitled
to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for
any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate
of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate
upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only
evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and
delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall
have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued
and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such
Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section
3.9 for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be
deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder
and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

Section 3.4 Temporary Securities.
---------------------

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any
series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order from the
Company and a Company Order from the Guarantor, the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed,
lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in
any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the
definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, and
having endorsed thereon Guarantees of the Guarantor substantially
of the tenor of the definitive Guarantees, with such appropriate
insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the
officers executing such Securities and Guarantees may determine,
as evidenced by their execution of such Securities and
Guarantees.

If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the
Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be
prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of
definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of
such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of
such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such
series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of
Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon
surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary
Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a

-27-

<PAGE> 34

like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series
and of like tenor, having endorsed thereon Guarantees of the
Guarantor, of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the
temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive
Securities of such series.

Section 3.5 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
----------------------------------------------------

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such
office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a
Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to
as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for
the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities.
The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the
purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as
herein provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security
of any series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place
of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the
designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities
of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like
aggregate principal amount and tenor having endorsed thereon the
Guarantee duly executed by the Guarantor.

At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be
exchanged for other Securities of the same series of any
authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount
and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at
such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so
surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities having
endorsed thereon Guarantees of the Guarantor which the Holder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities, and all Guarantees endorsed thereon,
shall be the valid obligations of the Company or the Guarantor,
as the case may be, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the
same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities and all
Guarantees endorsed thereon surrendered upon such registration of
transfer or exchange.

Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or
the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written

-28-
<PAGE> 35

instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and
the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than
exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any
transfer.

If the Securities of any series (or of any series and
specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall
not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and
specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at
the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of
a notice of redemption of any such Securities of that series
selected for redemption under Section 11.3 and ending at the
close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register
the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for
redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of
any Security being redeemed in part.

The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall
apply only to Global Securities:

(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture
shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for
such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such
Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each
such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all
purposes of this Indenture.

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture,
no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for
Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in
whole or in part may be registered, in the names of Persons other
than the Depositary for such Security or its nominee unless (i)
such Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or
unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if
at any time such Depositary has ceased to be a clearing agency
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
(ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of
Default with respect to the Securities, (iii) the Company
executes and delivers to the Trustee an order to the effect that
the Global Securities shall be transferable and exchangeable or
(iv) there shall exist such circumstances in addition to or in

-29-

<PAGE> 36

lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as
contemplated by Section 3.1.

(3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global
Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part,
and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or
any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the
Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.

(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon
registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a
Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this
Section, Section 3.4, 3.6, 9.6 or 11.7 or otherwise, shall be
authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a
Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name
of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or
a nominee thereof.

Section 3.6 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
-------------------------------------------------

If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series
and of like tenor and principal amount, having endorsed thereon
the Guarantee of the Guarantor, and bearing a number not
contemporaneously outstanding.

If there shall be delivered to the Company, the Guarantor
and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security
or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and
any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice
to the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee that such Security
has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall
execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security,
a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal
amount, having endorsed thereon the Guarantee of the Guarantor,
and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the
Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security,
pay such Security.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section,
the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and
expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

-30-

<PAGE> 37

Every new Security of any series, having endorsed thereon
the Guarantee of the Guarantor, issued pursuant to this Section
in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall
constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the
Company and the Guarantor, whether or not the destroyed, lost or
stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and
shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally
and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that
series duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies
with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Section 3.7 Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
-----------------------------------------------

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1
with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any
Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the
Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest.

Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable,
but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest
Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record
Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted
Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any
Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the
Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor
Securities) are registered at the close of business on a
Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The
Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of
Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of
such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the
same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an
amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be
paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit
prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when
deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause

-31-

<PAGE> 38

provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record
date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and
not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed
payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the
Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee
shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record
Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company,
shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to
each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set
forth in Section 1.6 not less than 10 days prior to such
Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor
having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid
to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series
(or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered
at the close of business on such Special Record Date and
shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause
(2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted
Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful
manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any
securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed,
and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange,
if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the
proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of
payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each
Security delivered under this Indenture, having endorsed thereon
the Guarantee of the Guarantor, upon registration of transfer of
or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry
the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which
were carried by such other Security.

Section 3.8 Persons Deemed Owners.
----------------------

Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent
of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person
in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such
Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of
(and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on
such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or
not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Guarantor, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company, the
Guarantor or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

-32-

<PAGE> 39

Section 3.9 Cancellation.
-------------

All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption,
registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any
sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other
than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be
promptly cancelled by it. The Company or the Guarantor may at
any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities
previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the
Company or the Guarantor may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other
Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any
Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company
has not issued and sold and all Securities so delivered shall be
promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities
cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly
permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by
the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order
from the Company.

Section 3.10 Computation of Interest.
------------------------

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1
for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each
series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months.

expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the
Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging

the Company,

and the Company or the Guarantor, in the case of (i),
(ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for
the purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities
not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancella-
tion, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest
to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities
which have become due and payable) or to the Stated
Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;

payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including
the Company or the Guarantor acting as Paying Agent) as the
Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the
principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment
such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee as
contemplated by Section 4.1, Section 13.2 or Section 13.3.

series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing
to the Company and the Guarantor (and to the Trustee if given by
Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or
specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with
respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained
by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company, the
Guarantor and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration
and its consequences if

(1) the Company or the Guarantor has paid or deposited
with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of
that series,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on)
any Securities of that series which have become due
otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and
interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed
therefor in such Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest
is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate
or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee
hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities
of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal
of Securities of that series which have become due solely by
such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived
as provided in Section 5.13.

<PAGE> 45

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

Section 5.3 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Company covenants that if

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on
any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and
such default continues for a period of 30 days; or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of
(or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity
thereof,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the
benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then
due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if
any) and interest and, to the extent that payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue
principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at
the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in
addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any
series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the
rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the
specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein,
or to enforce any other proper remedy.

order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in
any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be
authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property
payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,

sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such
payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders,
to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Trustee under Section 6.7.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf
of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment
or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any
Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of
the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided,

instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as
trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,

-----------------------------

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any
Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any
Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or

exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements
of Section 6.11.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the
Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof
to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor
Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to
the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of

<PAGE> 55

Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or
more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly
appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any
such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the
Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any
time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the
Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the
applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year

accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such
successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance,
shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and
duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the
Company, the Guarantor or the successor Trustee, such retiring
Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver

-49-

<PAGE> 56

an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the
rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly
assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all

more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental
hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such
appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall
be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest
in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and
duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of
that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with
respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall
be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights,
powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to
the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the
retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the
provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for
or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more
than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in
such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees
co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be
trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from
any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such
Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental
indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee
shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each
such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of
such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company,
the Guarantor or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee
shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee
all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder
with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which
the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company
and the Guarantor shall execute any and all instruments for more

converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate
trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the
Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise
qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution
or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of
the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office,
any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such
authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver
the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such
successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

Section 6.13 Preferential Collection of Claims.
----------------------------------

If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the
Company or the Guarantor (or any other obligor upon the
Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of

authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate
Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon
exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof
or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall
be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid
and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the
Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture
to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee
or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference
shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf
of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of
authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation

of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia,
authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having
a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State
authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the
requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for
the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of
such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined
capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent

rescission shall in any manner relieve either the Company or the
Guarantor of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in
each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such
purposes. The Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will
give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation

series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the
Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay
the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise
disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the
Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

Whenever the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be,

Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of
(and premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that
series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the
principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such
sum to be held as provided in the Trust Indenture Act and (unless
such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company or the Guarantor,

-61-

<PAGE> 68

as the case may be, will promptly notify the Trustee of its
action or failure so to act.

The Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will cause
each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the
Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in
which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to
the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will

(1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture
Act applicable to it as Paying Agent and

(2) during the continuance of any default by the
Company, the Guarantor (or any other obligor upon the
Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in
respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written
request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all
sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in
respect of the Securities of that series.

The Company or the Guarantor may at any time, for the
purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order of
the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, direct any
Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the
Company, the Guarantor or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held
by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums
were held by the Company, the Guarantor or such Paying Agent;
and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such
Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with
respect to such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or
then held by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, in
trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any)
or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed
for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or
interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company
or the Guarantor, as the case may be, on Company Request of the
Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or (if then held by
the Company or the Guarantor) shall be discharged from such
trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an
unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company or the
Guarantor (pursuant to the Guarantees) for payment thereof, and
all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to
such trust money, and all liability of the Company or the
Guarantor as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being
required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the
Company cause to be published once in a newspaper published in

-62-

<PAGE> 69

the English language, customarily published on each Business Day
and of general circulation in The City of New York, notice that
such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified

case may be.

necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments, and
improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company or
the Guarantor, as the case may be, may be necessary so that the
business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and
advantageously conducted at all times; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, from discontinuing the operation
or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance
is, in the judgment of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case
may be, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business
of any of their respective Subsidiaries and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 10.6 Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become

might by law become a lien upon the property of the Company, the
Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Company and the Guarantor shall not be required to pay or
discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax,
assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1
for Securities of such series, the Company or the Guarantor, as
the case may be, may, with respect to the Securities of any
series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term,
provision or condition set forth in any covenant pursuant to
Section 3.1 (19) 9.1(2) or 9.1(7) for the benefit of the Holder
of such series, or in Sections 10.7 and 10.8, inclusive, if
before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
such series and of at least 66 2/3% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of all series affected thereby shall, by
Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such
instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision
or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such
term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly
waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the
obligations of the Company and the Guarantor and the duties of
the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition
shall remain in full force and effect.

ARTICLE 11

Redemption of Securities

Section 11.1 Applicability of Article.
-------------------------

Securities of any series which are redeemable before their
Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their
terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by
Section 3.1 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this
Article.

Section 11.2 Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
--------------------------------------

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall
be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in any other manner
specified as contemplated in Section 3.1 for such Securities. In
case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less
than all the Securities of any series (including any redemption
affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 60
days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a
shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the
Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of

-66-

<PAGE> 73

Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of
the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any
redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any
restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such
Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall
furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing
compliance with such restriction.

Section 11.3 Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.
--------------------------------------------------

If less than all the Securities of any series are to be
redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a
specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption
affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be
redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the
Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities
of such series not previously called for redemption, by such
method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which
may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the
principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that
the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security
shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less
than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If
less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified
tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a
single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall
be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by
the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and
specified tenor not previously called for redemption in
accordance with the preceding sentence.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of
the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any
Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed.

The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not
apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single
Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in
part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed
portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an
authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum
authorized denomination) for such Security.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context
otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of
Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed
or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal
amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.

-67-

<PAGE> 74

Section 11.4 Notice of Redemption.
---------------------

Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be
redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price;

(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any
series consisting of more than a single Security are to be
redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial
redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities
to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities
of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed,
the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed;

(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will
become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed
and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on
and after said date;

(5) the place or places where each such Security is to be
surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; and

(6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is
the case.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the
election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the
Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense
of the Company.

Section 11.5 Deposit of Redemption Price.
----------------------------

Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with
the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting
as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided
in Section 10.3) an amount of money sufficient to pay the
Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be
an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities
which are to be redeemed on that date.

Section 11.6 Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
--------------------------------------

-68-

<PAGE> 75

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the
Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date,
become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified,
and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in
the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such
Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any
such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such
Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price,
together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by
Section 3.1, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on
or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of
such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities,
registered as such at the close of business on the relevant
Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of
Section 3.7.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid
upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and
premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the
Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.

Section 11.7 Securities Redeemed in Part.
----------------------------

Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be
surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company
or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and
the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, the
Guarantees of the Guarantor shall be endorsed on and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security
without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same
series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as
requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to
and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of
the Security so surrendered.

ARTICLE 12

Sinking Funds

Section 12.1 Applicability of Article.
-------------------------

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any
sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except
as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for
Securities of such series.

-69-

<PAGE> 76

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for
by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as
a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of
such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of
any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund
payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any
series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be
subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.2. Each sinking
fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of
any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such
series.

Section 12.2 Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
------------------------------------------------------

The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a
series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2)
may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been
redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the
terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted
optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such
Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of
any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such
series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such
Securities as provided for by the terms of such series; PROVIDED
that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such
Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the
Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for
redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount
of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 12.3 Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
------------------------------------------

Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment
date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to
the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the
next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the
terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be
satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities
of that series pursuant to Section 12.2 and will also deliver to
the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30
days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall
select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund
payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.3 and cause
notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and
at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section
11.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such
Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated
in Sections 11.6 and 11.7.

ARTICLE 13

Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

Section 13.1 Applicability of Article; Company's Option to
---------------------------------------------
Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
- - -----------------------------------------

The Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have
Section 13.2 or Section 13.3 applied to any Securities or any
series of Securities, as the case may be, designated pursuant to
Section 3.1 as being defeasible pursuant to such Section 13.2 or
13.3, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided
pursuant to Section 3.1 and upon compliance with the conditions
set forth in this Article. Any such election shall be evidenced
by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as
contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities.

Section 13.2 Defeasance and Discharge.
-------------------------

Upon the Company's exercise of the above option (if any)
applicable to this Section applied to any Securities or any
series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company and the
Guarantor shall be deemed to have been discharged from their
respective obligations with respect to Securities, and the
corresponding Guarantees, as provided in this Section on and
after the date the conditions set forth in Section 13.4 are
satisfied (hereinafter, called "defeasance"). For this purpose,
such defeasance means that the Company and the Guarantor shall be
deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness
represented by such Securities and Guarantees and to have
satisfied all their other obligations under such Securities and
Guarantees and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and
Guarantees are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the
Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the
same), subject to the following which shall survive until
otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of
Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund
described in Section 13.4 and as more fully set forth in such
Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if
any) and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (B)
the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under
Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 10.2 and 10.3, (C) the rights, powers,
trusts, duties, and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D)
this Article Thirteen. Subject to compliance with this Article
Thirteen, the Company may exercise its option (if any) under this
Section 13.2 applied to any Securities notwithstanding the prior
exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 13.3 applied to
such Securities.

-71-
<PAGE> 78

Section 13.3 Covenant Defeasance.
--------------------

Upon the Company's exercise of the above option (if any)
applicable to this Section applied to any Securities or series of
Securities, as the case may be, (A), the Company shall be
released from its obligations under Section 10.8 and any
covenants provided pursuant to Sections 3.1(19), 9.1(2) and
9.1(7) and (B) the occurrence of any event specified in Section
5.1(4) with respect to either of Section 8.1(3) or Section 10.8
and any such covenants provided pursuant to Sections 3.1(19),
9.1(2), 9.1(7), 5.1(5) and 5.1(8) shall be deemed not to be or
result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such
Securities as provided in this Section, and the Guarantor shall
be released from its obligations under Section 10.7 respect to
such Securities as provided in this Section, on and after the
date the conditions set forth in Section 13.4 are satisfied
(hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"). For this purpose, such
covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities,
the Company and the Guarantor may omit to comply with and shall
have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation
set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so
specified in the case of Section 5.1(4)), whether directly or
indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any
such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to
any other provision herein or in any other document, but the
remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be
unaffected thereby.

Section 13.4 Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
------------------------------------------------

The following shall be the conditions to application of
either Section 13.2 or Section 13.3 to any Securities or any
series of Securities, as the case may be:

(a) the Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused
to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee which
satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 6.9 and who
agrees to comply with the provisions of this Article Thirteen
applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of
making the following payments, specifically pledged as security
for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such
Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government
Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and
interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will
provide, not later than one day before the due date of any
payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, in
each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and

-72-

<PAGE> 79

discharge the principal of and any premium and interest on such
Securities on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance
with the terms of this Indenture and of such Securities. As used
herein, "U.S. Government Obligations" means securities that are
(x) direct obligations of the United States of America for the
payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged or (y)
obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as
an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the
payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith
and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in
either case, are not callable or redeemable at the option of the
issuer thereof, and shall also include a depository receipt
issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended) as custodian with respect to any such
U.S. Government Obligation or a specific payment of principal of
or interest on any such U.S. Government Obligation held by such
custodian for the account of the holder of such depository
receipt, PROVIDED that (except as required by law) such custodian
is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable
to the holder of such depository receipt from any amount received
by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or
the specific payment of principal of or interest on the U.S.
Government Obligation evidenced by such depository receipt.

(b) In the case of an election to have Section 13.2 apply
to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may
be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel stating that (x) the Company has received from, or there
has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or
(y) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in
the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that,
the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss
for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit,
defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such
Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such defeasance had not occurred.

(c) In the case of an election to have Section 13.3 apply
to any Securities or series of Securities, as the case may be,
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will
not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and covenant defeasance to be effected
with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such covenant
defeasance had not occurred.

-73-

<PAGE> 80

(d) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer's Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities
nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on
any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such
deposit.

(e) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or
both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such
Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any
such event specified in Section 5.1(6) and (7), at any time on or
prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being
understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied
until after such 90th day).

(f) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not cause
the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of
the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default
within the meaning of such Act).

(g) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result
in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any
other agreement or instrument to which the Company or the
Guarantor is a party or by which either of them is bound.

(h) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result
in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment
company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940
unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt
from registration thereunder.

(i) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for relating to either the
defeasance under Section 13.2 or the covenant defeasance under
Section 13.3 (as the case may be) have been complied with.

Section 13.5 Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to
--------------------------------------------------
Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
- - -------------------------------------------------

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section
10.3, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the
proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying
trustee (solely for purposes of this Section 13.5 and Section
13.6, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to
collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 13.4 in
respect of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall be
held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the
provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment,
either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the

-74-
<PAGE> 81

Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and
to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if
any) and interest, but such money need not be segregated from
other funds except to the extent required by law.

The Company and the Guarantor shall pay and indemnify the
Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or
assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited
pursuant to Section 13.4 or the principal and interest received
in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge
which by law is for the account of the Holders of the Outstanding
Securities of such series.

Anything in this Article Thirteen to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company
from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S.
Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 13.4
which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of
the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited
to effect an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance.

Section 13.6. Reinstatement.
--------------

If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any
money in accordance with this Article with respect to any
Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this
Indenture and such Securities from which the Company and
Guarantor have been discharged or released pursuant to Section
13.2 or 13.3 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit
had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such
Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is
permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section
13.5 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this
Article; provided, however, that if the Company or the Guarantor
makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on
any such Security following such reinstatement of its
obligations, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be,
shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such
Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in
trust.

Reverse of Security
-------------------

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or
more series under an Indenture, dated as of August 15, 1994 (herein referred to
as the "Indenture"), among the Company, XTRA Corporation, as Guarantor (herein
called the "Guarantor," which term includes any successor Guarantor under the
Indenture), and the Trustee, to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a
statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and
are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series
designated on the face hereof.

If an Initial Redemption Date is specified on the face hereof, this
Security is subject to redemption upon notice by first- class mail given not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, at
any time as a whole or in part, on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if
any, specified on the face hereof, at the election of the Company, at the
Redemption Prices, if any, specified on the face hereof, (expressed in
percentages of the principal amount), and thereafter at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of this Security, plus accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, that interest installments whose Stated
Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders
of such Securities (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the
close of business on the relevant Record Date referred to on the face hereof,
all as provided in the Indenture.

"Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in Boston,
Massachusetts or New York, New York are authorized or obligated by law or
executive order to close.

Payments of interest hereon with respect to any Interest Payment date
will include interest accrued to but excluding such Interest Payment Date.

Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date or from the last
date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for is calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Such interest shall accrue
from the Original Issue Date, or from the last date to which interest has been
paid or duly provided for, but excluding the date for which accrued interest is
being calculated.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity of
the principal of this Security shall not be a Business

-4-
<PAGE> 5
Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of the Indenture) the
payment of interest and/or of principal need not be made on such date, but may
be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as
if made on such Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity, and no
interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and
after such Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity to such next succeeding
Business Day.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i)
the entire indebtedness of this Security or (ii) certain covenants with respect
to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set
forth therein.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of
each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the
Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of 66 2/3% in
principal amount of all Outstanding Securities at the time and of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be
affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of
specified percentages in principal amount of all the Securities and the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of
all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company, the
Guarantor, or both with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued
upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu
hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium (if any) and
interest on this Security at the times, place and rate (except as provided for
in such Security), and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
(including, in the case of any Global Security, certain additional limitations)
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon

-5-
<PAGE> 6
surrender of such Securities for registration of transfer at the office or
agency of the Company in any place where the principal of, premium (if any) and
interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the
Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of like tenor,
of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a
like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering
the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee and any agent of the
Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this
Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee
nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by

Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid
or obligatory for any purpose.

Reverse of Security
-------------------

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or
more series under an Indenture, dated as of August 15, 1994 (herein referred to
as the "Indenture"), among the Company, XTRA Corporation, as Guarantor (herein
called the "Guarantor," which term includes any successor Guarantor under the
Indenture), and the Trustee, to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a
statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and
are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series
designated on the face hereof.

If an Initial Redemption Date is specified on the face hereof, this
Security is subject to redemption upon notice by first- class mail given not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, at
any time as a whole or in part, on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if
any, specified on the face hereof, at the election of the Company, at the
Redemption Prices, if any, specified on the face hereof, (expressed in
percentages of the principal amount), and thereafter at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of this Security, plus accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, that interest installments whose Stated
Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders
of such Securities (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the
close of business on the relevant Record Date referred to on the face hereof,
all as provided in the Indenture.

The rate of interest on this Security will be reset and become
effective weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually (each an
"Interest Reset Period"), as set forth on the face hereof depending on the
Interest Reset Period specified herein; provided, however, that (i) the
interest rate in effect from the Original Issue Date to the first Interest
Reset Date (as defined below) will be the Initial Interest Rate, and (ii) the
interest rate in effect for the ten days immediately before Stated Maturity of
this security will be that in effect hereon on the tenth day preceding such
Stated Maturity. Except as provided in the next sentence, the date or dates on
which interest will reset (each an "Interest Reset Date") will be, if this
Security resets weekly (unless the Interest Rate Basis for this Security is the
Treasury Rate), the Wednesday of each week; if this Security resets weekly and
the Interest Rate Basis for this Security is the Treasury Rate, the Tuesday of
each week (except as provided below); if this Security resets monthly, the
third Wednesday of each month; if this Security resets quarterly, the third
Wednesday of each March, June, September and December; if this Security

-5-
<PAGE> 6
resets semiannually, the third Wednesday of two months of each year, as
specified herein; and if this Security resets annually, the third Wednesday of
one month of each year, as specified herein. If any Interest Reset Date would
otherwise be a day that is not a Market Day for this Security, the Interest
Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Market Day for this
Security, except that if the Interest Rate Basis specified herein is LIBOR and
such next succeeding such Market Day is the next succeeding calendar month,
such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Market Day for this
Security.

"Market Day" means, for any Security other than a Security the rate of
interest on which shall be determined in accordance with the provisions under
the heading "LIBOR" below, any Business Day, and, for any Security the rate of
interest on which shall be determined in accordance with the provisions under
the heading "LIBOR" below, any such Business Day on which dealings in deposits
in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. "Business Day",
means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day
on which banking institutions in Boston, Massachusetts or New York, New York
are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

The rate of interest on this Security in effect on any day on or after
the first Interest Reset Date shall equal either (i) if such day is an Interest
Reset Date, the interest rate for such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if such day
is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate for the immediately preceding
Interest Reset Date; provided, however, that the interest rate in effect for
the ten days immediately before the Stated Maturity of this Security will be
that in effect hereon on the tenth day preceding such stated Maturity.

Except as otherwise specified in this paragraph, the rate of interest
on this security for each Interest Reset Date shall be the rate determined in
accordance with the provisions below under the heading below corresponding to
the Interest Rate Basis specified herein:

Commercial Paper Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is
the Commercial Paper Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest
Reset Date shall equal (a) the Money Market Yield (calculated as
described below) of the per annum rate (quoted on a bank discount
basis) for the relevant Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date
for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified herein, (i)
as such rate is published by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest
Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of governors of the
Federal Reserve System ("H.15(519)") under the heading "Commercial
Paper" or (ii) if such rate is not published before 9:00 A.M., New
York City time, on the

-6-
<PAGE> 7
relevant Calculation Date, then as such rate is published by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York in its daily statistical release,
"Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities" or any
successor publication published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York ("Composite Quotations") under the heading "Commercial Paper" or
(b) if by 3:00 P.M. New York City time, on such Calculation Date, such
rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations,

rates (quoted on a bank discount basis) as of 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on such Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date, of
three leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of New York
selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index
Maturity specified herein placed for an industrial issuer whose bond
rating is "AA", or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized rating
agency, in any of the above cases (a) or (b) as adjusted (x) by the
addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and
then (y) by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any,
specified herein; provided, however, that, if fewer than three dealers
selected as provided above by the Calculation Agent are quoting as
mentioned in this sentence, the interest rate herein for such Interest
Reset Date will be the interest rate hereon in effect on such
Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the
first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate). "Money Market
Yield" shall be a yield (expressed an a percentage) calculated in
accordance with the following formula:

Money Market Yield = 100 x 360 x D
-------
360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper, quoted on
a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and "M" refers to the
actual number of days in the interest period for which the interest is
being calculated.

Prime Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the Prime
Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall equal
(a)(i) the rate for the relevant Prime Rate Interest Determination
Date set forth in H.15(519) under the heading "Bank Prime Loan", or
(ii) if such rate is not published before 9:00 A.M., New York City
time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the arithmetic mean of
the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on
the display designated as page "NYMF" on the Reuters Monitor Money
Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the NYMF page on that
services for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending
rates of major United States banks) ("Reuters Screen NYMF Page") as
such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect for such
Prime

-7-
<PAGE> 8
Rate Interest Determination Date as quoted on the Reuters Screen NYMF
Page on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date or (b) if fewer
than four such rates appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page on such
Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the arithmetic mean of the
prime rates or base lending rates (quoted on the basis of the actual
number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year) as of the close
of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three
major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent,
in any of the above cases (a) or (b) as adjusted (x) by the addition
or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y)
by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified
herein;provided, however, that, if fewer than three banks selected as
provided above by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned in
this sentence, the interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Date
will be the interest rate hereon in effect on such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date (or in the case of the first Interest Reset Date,
the Initial Interest Rate).

LIBOR. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is LIBOR, the
interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall be determined
in accordance with the following provisions:

(a) On the relevant LIBOR Interest Determination Date, the interest
rate will be determined on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the
offered rates for deposits of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 having the
Index Maturity specified herein, commencing on the second Market Day
immediately following such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, that
appear on the display designated as page "LIBO" on the Reuter Monitor
Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page
on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered
rates of major banks) ("Reuters Screen LIBO Page") as of 11:00 A.M.,
London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, if at least
two such offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page,
adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any,
specified herein, and then (y) by the multiplication by the Spread
Multiplier, if any, specified herein. If fewer than two offered rates
appear, the interest rate hereon for such LIBOR Interest Reset Date
will be determined as described in (b) below.

(b) For a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which fewer than two
offered rates for the Index Maturity specified herein appear on the
Reuters Screen LIBO Page as described in (a) above, the interest rate
hereon will be determined on the basis of the rates at approximately
11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date at
which deposits in U.S. dollars for the period of the Index Maturity
specified herein are offered to prime banks in the London

-8-
<PAGE> 9
interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market
selected by the Calculation Agent commencing on the second Market Day
immediately following such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a
principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000
that in the Calculation Agent's judgment is representative for a
single transaction in such market at such time (a "Representative
Amount"). The Calculation Agent will request the principal London
office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If
at least two such quotations are provided, the interest rate hereon
with respect to such Interest Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean
of such quotations, as adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction of
the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y) by the
multiplication by the Spread multiplier, if any, specified herein. If
fewer than two quotations are provided, the interest rate hereon for
such Interest Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such LIBOR
Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New
York, selected by the Calculation Agent, for loans in U.S. dollars to
leading European banks having the Index Maturity specified herein
commencing on the Interest Reset Date and in a Representative Amount,
as adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any,
specified herein, and then (y) by the multiplication by the Spread
Multiplier, if any, specified herein; provided, however, that, if
fewer than three banks selected as provided above by the Calculation
Agent are quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the interest rate
hereon for such Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate hereon
in effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date (or, in the case
of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).

Treasury Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the
Treasury Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date
shall equal (a) the rate for the auction on the relevant Treasury
Interest Determination Date of direct obligations of the United States
("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified herein, (i) as
such rate is published in H.15(519) under the heading "U.S. Government
Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction Average (Investment)" or (ii) if
such rate is not so published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the
relevant Calculation Date, then the auction average rate (expressed as
a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
applicable, and applied on a daily basis) for such auction as
otherwise announced by the United States Department of the Treasury or
(b) if the results of such auction of Treasury bills having the Index
Maturity specified herein are not published or reported as provided
above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date or if
no such auction is held during such week, then the rate set forth in
H.15(519) for the relevant

-9-
<PAGE> 10
Treasury Interest Determination Date for the Index Maturity specified
herein under the heading "U.S. Government Securities/Treasury
Bills/Secondary Market" or (c) if such rate is not so published by
3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then
the yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of
a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily
basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates as of
approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury Interest
Determination Date, of three primary United States government
securities dealers in The City of New York selected by the Calculation
Agent for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity
closest to the Index Maturity specified herein, in any of the above
cases (a), (b) or (c) as adjusted (x) by the addition or subtraction
of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and then (y) by the
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified herein;
provided, however, that, if fewer than three dealers selected as
provided above by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned in
this sentence, the interest rate hereon for such Interest Reset Date
will be the interest rate hereon in effect on such Treasury Interest
Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Interest Reset Date,
the Initial Interest Rate).

CD Rate. If the Interest Rate Basis of this Security is the CD Rate,
the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset Date shall equal (a)
the rate for the relevant CD Rate Interest Determination Date for
negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified
herein (i) as published in H.15(519) under the heading "CDs (Secondary
Market)" or (ii) if such rate is not published before 9:00 A.M., New
York City time, on the relevant Calculation Date, then the rate on
such CD Rate Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates
of deposit having the Index Maturity specified herein as published in
Composite Quotations under the heading "Certificates of Deposit", or
(b) if by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date such
rate is not published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the
arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates, as of 10:00
A.M., New York City time, on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date,
of three leading nonbank dealers of negotiable U.S. dollar
certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the
Calculation Agent for negotiable certificates of deposit of major
United States money center banks with a remaining maturity closest to
the Index Maturity specified herein in a denomination of U.S.
$5,000,000, in any of the above cases (a) or (b) as adjusted (x) by
the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein,
and then (y) by the multiplication by the spread multiplier, if any,
specified herein;provided, however, that, if fewer than three dealers
selected as provided above by the Calculation

-10-
<PAGE> 11
Agent are quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the interest rate
hereon for such Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate hereon
in effect on such CD Rate Interest Determination Date (or, in the case
of the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).

Federal Funds Rat. If the Interest Rate Basis of this security is the
Federal Funds Rate, the interest rate hereon for any Interest Reset
Date shall equal (a) the rate on the relevant Federal Funds Interest
Determination Date for Federal Funds (i) as published in H.15(519)
under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)" or (ii) if such rate is
not published before 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the relevant
Calculation Date, then the rate on such Federal Funds Interest
Determination Date as published in Composite Quotations under the
heading "Federal Funds/Effective Rate" or (b) if by 3:00 p.m., New
York City time, on such Calculation Date such rate is not published in
either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the arithmetic mean of the
rates, as of 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Federal Funds
Interest Determination Date, for the last transaction in overnight
Federal Funds arranged by three leading brokers of Federal Funds
transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation
Agent, in any of the above cases (a) or (b) as adjusted (x) by the
addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified herein, and
then (y) by the multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any,
specified herein;provided, however, that, if fewer than three brokers
selected as provided above by the Calculation Agent are quoting as
mentioned in this sentence, the interest rate hereon for such Interest
Reset Date will be the interest rate hereon in effect on such Federal
Funds Interest Determination Date (or, in the case of the first
Interest Reset Date, the Initial Interest Rate).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater
than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate,
if any, specified herein. In addition, the interest rate hereon will in no
event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Company will at all times appoint and maintain a banking
institution that is not an Affiliate of the Company as Calculation Agent
hereunder. The Company has initially appointed The First National Bank of
Boston as such Calculation Agent and will give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of any change in such appointment. The Company will cause the
Calculation Agent to calculate the interest rate on this Security for any
Interest Reset Date in accordance with the foregoing on or before the
Calculation Date pertaining to the related Interest Determination Date. Except
as otherwise provided herein, all percentages resulting from any calculations
will be rounded upwards, if

-11-
<PAGE> 12
necessary, to the next higher one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point
(e.g., 9.876541% (or .09876541) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and
all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards). The
Calculation Agent's determination of any interest rate will be final and
binding in the absence of manifest error.

Upon the request of the Holder of this Security, the Company will
cause the Calculation Agent to provide to such Holder the interest rate hereon
then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate hereon which will become
effective on the next Interest Reset Date.

The Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date
if the rate of interest hereon shall be determined in accordance with the
provisions under the headings above entitled "Commercial Paper Rate" (the
"Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date"), "Prime Rate" (the "Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date"), "LIBOR" (the "LIBOR Interest Determination
Date"), "CD Rate" (the "CD Rate Interest Determination Date") and "Federal
Funds Rate" (the "Federal Funds Interest Determination Date") will be the
second Market Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. The Interest
Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date if the rate of interest
hereon shall be determined in accordance with the provisions under the heading
above entitled "Treasury Rate" (the "Treasury Interest Determination Date")
will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls on which
Treasury bills would normally be auctioned. If, as the result of a legal
holiday, an auction is held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the
Treasury Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date
occurring in the next succeeding week. If an auction date shall fall on any
Interest Reset Date for a Treasury Rate Security, then such Interest Reset Date
shall instead be the first Market Day immediately following such auction date.

The Calculation Date pertaining to any LIBOR Interest Determination
Date for any Security shall be such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, and the
Calculation Date pertaining to any other Interest Determination Date for any
Security shall be the tenth day after such Interest Determination Date or, if
any such day is not a Market Day for such Security, the next succeeding such
Market Day.

Payments of interest hereon with respect to any Interest Payment date
will include interest accrued to but excluding such Interest Payment Date;
provided, however, that, if the Interest Reset Period with respect to this
Security is weekly, the interest payable on any Interest Payment Date, other
than interest payable on the date on which principal is payable, will include
interest

-12-
<PAGE> 13
accrued to but excluding the day following the next preceding Regular Record
Date.

Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date or from the last
date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for is calculated by
multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest
factor. Such accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor
calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date, or from the last date to
which interest has been paid or duly provided for, but excluding the date for
which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a
decimal) for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate (expressed
as a decimal) applicable to such day by 360 or, if the Interest Rate Basis for
this Security is the Treasury Rate, by the actual number of days in the year.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity of
the principal of this Security shall not be a Business Day, then
(notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of the Indenture) the payment of
interest and/or of principal need not be made on such date, but may be made on
the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on
such Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity, and no interest shall
accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest
Payment Date or Stated Maturity to such next succeeding Business Day.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the securities of this series
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of
each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the
Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of 66 2/3% in
principal amount of all Outstanding Securities at the time and of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be
affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of
specified percentages in principal amount of all the Securities and the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of
all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company, the
Guarantor, or both with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued
upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefore or in lieu

-13-
<PAGE> 14
hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium (if any) and
interest on this Security at the times, place and rate (except as provided for
in such Security), and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
(including, in the case of any Global Security, certain additional limitations)
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of such Securities for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of, premium
(if any) and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities
of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a
like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering
the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee and any agent of the
Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this
Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee
nor any such Agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
