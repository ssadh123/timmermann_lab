INTERNATIONAL PAPER REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS
UP 47 PERCENT FROM YEAR AGO

For Immediate Release
- ---------------------
October 11, 1994

PURCHASE, N.Y. -- International Paper today reported 1994
third-quarter net earnings of $109 mlllion or $.87 per share, a
47 percent increase over 1993 third-quarter net earnings of $73
million or $.59 a share (a 123 percent increase, based on last
year's reported earnings of $48 million or $.39 a share after a
special charge to revalue deferred taxes). Net earnings for the
1994 third quarter were 24 percent higher than the 1994 second-
quarter net earnings of $87 million or $.70 per share.

Third-quarter 1994 sales were $3.8 billion, 11 percent above
last year's third-quarter sales of $3.4 billion.

"Our business is continuing to improve, and we believe we
will see even stronger earnings in the final quarter of the
year," said John A. Georges, chairman and chief executive
officer. "With expanding economies in the United States, Europe
and the Pacific rim, we are experiencing greater demand and
higher prices in essentially all of our products.

"As the worldwide economies improve, we expect demand for
paper and packaging products to grow faster than the industry's
manufacturing capacity. Our specialty products and forest
operations should continue to generate high levels of earnings.
While 1994 will be a year of substantial improvement for
International Paper, we believe that we will see even more robust
growth in 1995."

Overall, the third quarter's results were the best since the

second quarter of 1992. Containerboard sales and earnings were
up sharply from year-earlier levels. Consumer packaging earnings
also increased, due to the improving outlook in the bleached
board and liquid packaging businesses. The forest products
business maintained a high level of profitability. The printing

2

papers sector, led by a very strong market for pulp and a sharp
recovery in Europe, returned to profitability for the first time
in two years.

Specialty businesses' profits were lower as strong
performances by Masonite, decorative products, chemicals and
specialty industrial papers were offset by declines in the non-
wovens, imaging and petroleum businesses.

International Paper, headquartered in Purchase, N.Y., is a
worldwide producer of printing papers, packaging and forest
products. The company also operates specialty businesses and a
broadly-based paper distribution network. International Paper
has manufacturing operations in 27 countries and exports its
products to more than 130 nations.
