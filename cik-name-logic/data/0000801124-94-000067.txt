On October 3, 1994, Vanguard Real Estate Fund I (the Fund ) sold the

In accordance with the terms of the advisory agreement between the Fund
and Aldrich, Eastman and Waltch ("AEW"), in 1988 the Fund paid an
acquisition fee of $436,000, representing 2% of the purchase price, and
in the fourth quarter of 1994 will pay a disposition fee of approximately
$614,000, representing 2% of the net proceeds, in connection with the
sale of the Seattle Portfolio. The Fund also, at closing, paid a sales
incentive fee of $520,000 to Seattle's property manager. The Seattle
property manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the purchaser. The Fund
expects to recognize a gain of approximately $9,250,000 in the fourth
quarter of 1994 on the sale of Seattle.

The following unaudited pro forma statement of operations presents the results
of operations of Vanguard Real Estate Fund I ("VREF I") for the year ended
December 31, 1993, as if the October 3, 1994 disposition of the Seattle 
Industrials Portfolio ("Seattle"), the August 17, 1994 disposition of the Arden
Hills building ("Arden Hills") and the 1993 dispositions of Carmel Office
Park ("Carmel") and VREF I's Citadel II investment ("Citadel II") each
occurred on January 1, 1993. Such pro forma information is based upon (i)
the pro forma results of operations of VREF I for the year ended December 31,
1993, giving effect to the dispositions of Arden Hills, Carmel and Citadel II
as if such dispositions had occurred on January 1, 1993, as previously
reported in VREF I's current report on Form 8-K dated August 17, 1994 and (ii)
the historical results of operations for Seattle for the year ended December
31, 1993, giving effect to the pro forma adjustments relating only to those
items which will have a continuing impact on the Fund's Statement of Operations
described below. This statement does not purport to be indicative of results
of operations that actually would have resulted if VREF I had disposed of 
Seattle, Arden Hills, Carmel, and Citadel II on January 1, 1993. This statement
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of VREF I included
in its 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and
the pro forma financial statements included in VREF I's Current Report on Form
8-K dated August 17, 1994.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

(1) To record decreases in rental income, real estate taxes, property operating
expenses, and depreciation and amortization based on the historical
operating results of Seattle included in VREF I's historical results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(2) The Fund currently anticipates that the net proceeds of the Seattle
transaction will be paid out with its year-end 1994 distribution to
shareholders. For purposes of pro forma presentation of the Fund s
operating results for the year ended December 31, 1993, Fund management has
assumed that the net proceeds made available from the Seattle transaction
was immediately distributed to shareholders on January 1, 1993, and,
accordingly, no investment earnings have been imputed on the Seattle net
proceeds.

(3) To record a decrease in the investment advisory fee based upon the decrease
in real estate assets held by the Fund.

(4) To record a decrease in the administrative fee based upon the decrease in
assets held by the Fund.

(5) The estimated $9,250,000 gain on the sale of Seattle has not been included
in the pro forma statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
1993 since such gain is a nonrecurring gain after income from continuing
operations.

Pursuant to the Fund's prospectus, the Fund may not reinvest the net
proceeds received from sales in additional real estate investments after 
December 31, 1993. If cash available for investment , giving effect to
Seattle, Arden Hills and Carmel as if they had been disposed of on January
1, 1993, was assumed to have been invested in short-term money market
instruments (it is, in the opinion of the Fund's management, impracticable
to assume that a suitable real estate investment consistent with the Fund's
investment objectives would have been identified for the investment of such
available cash) and not assumed to have been distributed on January 1, 
1993, the Fund would have earned approximately $1,471,000 in short-term
investment income, using an average interest rate of 3.0%, on a pro forma 
basis for the year ended December 31, 1993, resulting in investment income
from short-term investments of $1,669,000.

The following unaudited pro forma statement of operations presents the results
of operations of Vanguard Real Estate Fund I ("VREF I") for the six months ended

Portfolio ("Seattle"), the August 17, 1994 disposition of the Arden Hills
building ("Arden Hills") and the 1993 dispositions of Carmel Office Park
("Carmel") and VREF I's Citadel II investment ("Citadel") each occurred on
January 1, 1993. Such pro forma information is based upon (i) the pro forma
results of operations of VREF I for the six months ended June 30, 1994, giving
effect to the dispositions of Arden Hills, Carmel and Citadel II as if such 
dispositions had occurred on January 1, 1993, as previously reported in VREF I's
current report on Form 8-K dated August 17, 1994 and (ii) the historical results
of operations for Seattle for the year ended December 31, 1993, giving effect

continuing impact on the Fund's Statement of Operations described below. 
This statement does not purport to be indicative of results of operations
that actually would have resulted if VREF I had disposed of Seattle, Arden
Hills, Carmel, and Citadel II on January 1, 1993. This statement should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements of VREF I included in its
1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and the pro

NOTES TO PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE SIX-MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1994

(1) To record decreases in rental income, real estate taxes, property operating
expenses, and depreciation and amortization based on the historical
operating results of Seattle included in VREF I's historical results of
operations for the six-months ended June 30, 1994.

(2) The Fund currently anticipates that the net proceeds of the Seattle
transaction will be paid out with its year-end 1994 distribution to
shareholders. For purposes of pro forma presentation of the Fund's
operating results for the six-months ended June 30, 1994, Fund
management has assumed that the net proceeds made available from this
transaction were immediately distributed to shareholders on January 1,
1993, and, accordingly, no investment earnings have been imputed on the
Seattle net proceeds.

(3) To record a decrease in the investment advisory fee based upon the decrease
in real estate assets held by the Fund.

(4) To record a decrease in the administrative fee based upon a decrease in
assets, resulting from the assumed January 1, 1993 distribution to
shareholders of the net proceeds of the Seattle transaction, held by the
Fund.

(5) Pursuant to the Fund s prospectus, the Fund may not reinvest the net
proceeds received from sales in additional real estate investments after
December 31, 1993. If cash available for investment, giving effect to
Seattle and Arden Hills as if they had been disposed of on January 1, 1993,
were assumed to have been invested in short-term money market instruments
for the first six months of 1994, and not assumed to have been distributed
on January 1, 1993, the Fund would have earned approximately $534,000 in
short-term investment income, using an average interest rate of 3.0%, on a
pro forma basis for the six-months ended June 30, 1994, resulting in
investment income from short-term investments of $691,000.
