Item 5. Other Events
------------

On January 21, 1994, Paramount Communications Inc.

("Paramount") terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the

"QVC Merger Agreement") with QVC Network, Inc. ("QVC"). In

addition, pursuant to the QVC Merger Agreement, the Exemption

Agreement with QVC (the "QVC Exemption Agreement") became

effective on January 21, 1994. The QVC Exemption Agreement 

provides for the amendment of the Rights Agreement relating to

Paramount's Common Stock Purchase Rights and the taking of

appropriate action so that restrictions on business combinations

contained in Article XI of Paramount's Restated Certificate of

Incorporation and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation

Law shall not apply to the consummation of the pending tender

offer by QVC for Paramount Common Stock (the "QVC Offer") if the

minimum condition with respect to the QVC Offer, among other

conditions, is satisfied. The QVC Exemption Agreement will

thereby allow Paramount stockholders, if they so choose, to have

their shares of Paramount Common Stock ("Shares") accepted for

payment pursuant to the QVC Offer. 

On January 21, 1994, Paramount and Viacom Inc.

("Viacom") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which

sets forth, among other things, (i) the revised terms of the

Viacom tender offer (as so revised, the "Revised Viacom Offer"),

which terms had provided for the purchase of 50.1% of the

outstanding Shares plus the Shares issuable upon the exercise of

<PAGE>

the then exercisable stock options, as of the expiration of the

offer, at a price of $105 per Share, and which now provide for

the purchase of such Shares at a price of $107 per Share and (ii)

the revised terms of the second-step merger to be effected in the

event the Revised Viacom Offer is consummated, which terms had

provided for the exchange of (A) 0.93065 shares of Viacom Class B

Common Stock and (B) 0.30408 shares of Viacom Merger Preferred

Stock for each remaining Share and which now provide for the

exchange of (1) 0.93065 shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock,

(2) 0.30408 shares of Viacom Merger Preferred Stock, (3) 0.93065

Contingent Value Rights and (4) 0.5 Warrants to purchase Viacom

Class B Common Stock for each remaining Share. 

A copy of the press release of Paramount, dated

January 21, 1994, relating to the above-described transactions is

attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by

reference.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 21, 1994

NEW YORK, Jan. 21 -- Paramount Communications Inc. (NYSE:PCI)

announced today that its Board of Directors has unanimously

recommended that Paramount's stockholders accept the revised

tender offer by Viacom Inc. and tender their shares pursuant to

that offer. Paramount also announced that, under the terms of

the bidding procedures initiated by the Board, the Company will

enter into a previously negotiated merger agreement with Viacom,

which will reflect the financial terms of the revised Viacom

proposal. Paramount also said that it will withdraw its

recommendation of the QVC offer and will terminate its existing

merger agreement with QVC. As is also the case with Viacom, QVC

continues to be bound by bidding procedures established by the

Paramount Board.

Martin S. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer of

Paramount Communications, said, "the Board determined, following

an analysis from its financial and legal advisors, that the

aggregate consideration offered in the Viacom offer and its

second step merger, taken together, represent the best value

available to Paramount stockholders at this time."

<PAGE>

Mr. Davis further stated that, "the Board is committed to

obtaining the best value for stockholders and, as contemplated by

the bidding procedures, is prepared to revisit today's

recommendation if further bids are received. The bidding

procedures," he added, "have from the beginning functioned fairly

and smoothly and have resulted in material improvements in value

for the Paramount stockholders. Consistent with that objective, 

the procedures will continue to enable bidders to increase

existing bids through the end of the bidding process on

February 1." 

Mr. Davis emphasized that "the bidding procedures ensure

that the decision of Paramount's stockholders in tendering their

shares to either Viacom or QVC will ultimately determine the

winning bidder."
