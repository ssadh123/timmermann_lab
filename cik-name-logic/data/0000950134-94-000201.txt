ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On March 16, 1994, the Company announced that it had called for redemption
on April 18, 1994 all of the Company's outstanding 7% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2010 ("Debentures"). The Debentures carry an aggregate face
value of approximately $47.2 million. The debentures will be redeemed for
$1,014 for each $1,000 principal amount plus accrued interest. Until the close
of business on April 18, 1994, holders may convert the Debentures into the
Company's common stock, par value $0.10, at a conversion price of $25 per
share. As a result of the redemption of the Debentures and assuming no
conversions of the Debentures into common stock, the Company will take
approximately $7.7 million, or $.14 per shares, as an extraordinary charge to
earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 1994.
