NET INCOME FOR COMMON STOCK
Net income for common stock decreased 57.8% during the first quarter of 1994 to
$21.5 million from $51.0 million in the same quarter of 1993. The decline
reflects the higher restated level of 1993 net income for common stock due to
the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. These changes
included a change in the Company's method of accounting for unbilled revenues
which had a $29.9 million (net of taxes) effect on net income and the offsetting
expense of $2.2 million (net of taxes) for the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits. The decline was also attributable to increased South Texas Project
electric generating station operating and maintenance expenses, increased
administrative and general expenses, additional depreciation, higher taxes other
than Federal income taxes, and the decline in Mirror CWIP liability
amortization. Partially offsetting the effects of the above items were increased
base revenues, reduced interest expense resulting from debt management
activities, and lower preferred stock dividends.
