Duke Announces Sale and Joint Venture

with Consolidated Communications

INDIANAPOLIS - Duke Realty Investments, Inc. (NYSE:DRE-Duke) and
Consolidated Communications Inc. (CCI) today announced the sale of the assets of
ITI-Duke Joint Venture to a newly formed affiliate of CCI in which Duke will be
admitted as a partner, subject to receiving a favorable letter ruling from the
IRS. ITI-Duke provided telecommunications services to tenants of Duke's owned
and managed properties.

Duke is an Indianapolis-based real estate investment trust which provides
real estate services to 2,200 tenants occupying 26 million square feet in eight
midwestern states. CCI is an Illinois-based, diversified telecommunications
holding company.

"We are pleased to announce our association with CCI, which enjoys a
reputation of being a leading-edge provider of telecommunications services,"
said David R. Mennel, Duke's general manager of the service operations. "Our
affiliation with CCI allows us to further add and enhance the services we
provide our tenants."

While full financial terms of the sale were not disclosed, Mennel said,
"Duke will recognize net income of approximately $2 million on the sale and will
share in the profits of the new company pending a favorable letter ruling from
the IRS."
