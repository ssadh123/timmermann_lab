GRACE REPORTS 17 PERCENT RISE IN THIRD QUARTER
PER SHARE OPERATING EARNINGS

BOCA RATON, Fla., October 27, 1994 -- W. R. Grace & Co. reported net
operating earnings of 81 cents per share in the third quarter of 1994, an
increase of 17 percent over the 69 cents per share earned in the 1993 quarter.
Net income in the current quarter was $76 million, compared to a net loss of
$236 million in the year ago quarter, which included a $300 million after-tax
charge related to asbestos insurance coverage.

Sales for the third quarter rose 15 percent to $1.31 billion, compared
to $1.14 billion a year ago.

"The balanced earnings growth from both the specialty chemicals and
health care businesses that we saw in the second quarter continued this
quarter," said J. P. Bolduc, president and chief executive officer. "Volumes
are generally strong, operating margins are improving, European results for
specialty chemicals are recovering nicely, and internal cost control efforts are
having a favorable impact. Selected price increases are being implemented to
offset raw material cost pressures. In all, current trends indicate we will
deliver solid results for the full year," he said.

<PAGE>

For the first nine months of 1994, operating earnings per share were
$1.91, a 16 percent increase from the $1.64 per share posted for the 1993
period. Including special charges in both periods, the nine months of 1994
showed a net loss of $20 million or 22 cents per share, compared with a net loss
in the 1993 nine-month period of $259 million or $2.86 per share. Nine month
sales rose 13 percent to $3.62 billion from $3.22 billion reported last year.

Pretax earnings from specialty chemicals rose 13 percent to $91 million
in the third quarter, including $4 million of costs associated with additional
European streamlining activities. Excluding these costs, all product lines
contributed to the increase, led by very strong results in construction, water
treatment and paper process chemicals, and container. Quarterly results for
fluid cracking catalysts (FCC) were below year ago levels due to lower North
American volumes, but were more than offset by increases from polyolefin
catalysts, and silicas and adsorbents, plus strong FCC earnings in other
regions. Packaging showed moderate improvement, as higher European and Latin
American results were partly offset by cost pressures in North America.

Pretax earnings from health care businesses rose 23 percent to $66
million, with continued strength from both domestic and international dialysis
as well as the homecare division. Results from the medical products group
lagged the year ago quarter but rose sharply from the previous quarter.

Grace is the world's largest specialty chemicals company and holds a
leadership position in specialized health care.
