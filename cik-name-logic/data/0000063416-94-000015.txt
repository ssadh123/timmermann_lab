effective by the Commission; and the Company has filed or will file
with the Commission a prospectus supplement specifically relating
to the Securities pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act"). The term Registration Statement
means registration statement no. 33-46021 as amended to the date of
this Agreement. The term Basic Prospectus means the prospectus
included in the Registration Statement. The term Prospectus means
the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement
specifically relating to the Securities, as filed with, or mailed
for filing to, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424. The term
preliminary prospectus means a preliminary prospectus supplement
specifically relating to the Securities together with the Basic
Prospectus. As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement",
"Basic Prospectus", "Prospectus" and "preliminary prospectus" shall
include in each case the material, if any, incorporated by
reference therein.

The Company hereby agrees to sell to the several

IV.

The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are
subject to the following conditions: 

2
<PAGE>
(a) (i) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceedings
for such purpose shall be pending before or threatened by the
Commission, and there shall have been no material adverse
change in the condition of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus, and you shall have received, on
the Closing Date, a certificate, dated the Closing Date and
signed by an executive officer of the Company, to the
foregoing effect. The officer making such certificate may
rely upon the best of his knowledge as to proceedings pending
or threatened; and 

(ii) subsequent to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have
occurred any downgrading in the rating accorded any of the
Company's securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor's Corporation. 

(b) You shall have received on the Closing Date an
opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, counsel for
the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that (i)
the Company has been duly organized and is subsisting and in
good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of
New York, (ii) the Indenture has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and
binding agreement, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
enforcement thereof may be limited by (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity), (iii) the Indenture has been qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture
Act"), (iv) the sale and issuance of the Securities have been
duly authorized by requisite corporate action on the part of
the Company, and the Securities, when executed and
authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture
and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be valid and
binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefit of
the Indenture and enforceable in accordance with their terms,
except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited
by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in
a proceeding at law or in equity), (v) this Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and 

3
<PAGE>
(vi) the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and
the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the prospectus
supplement, as of the date of the prospectus supplement,
appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all
material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities,
to the requirements of the Act, and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder. 

In addition, such counsel shall state that no facts have
come to the attention of such counsel in the course of their
review that have led them to believe that, insofar as relevant
to the offering of the Securities, the Registration Statement,
at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or that the Basic
Prospectus, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, on
the date of the prospectus supplement, contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Such opinion may state that such counsel do not
assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
fairness of the statements contained in the Registration
Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto, the Basic
Prospectus or the prospectus supplement except for those made
under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" in the
Basic Prospectus and "Description of Securities" and
"Underwriters" in the prospectus supplement insofar as they
relate to provisions of documents therein described and that
they do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial
statements, schedules or other financial data included or
incorporated by reference in or excluded from the Registration
Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto, the Basic
Prospectus or the prospectus supplement, or as to the
statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee
under the Indenture under which the Securities are being
issued. 

(c) You shall have received on the Closing Date an
opinion of Louis J. Garr, Jr., Esq., General Counsel for the
Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that (i) the
Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
business or the ownership or leasing of property requires such
qualification, (ii) each of the following subsidiaries of the
Company -- The May Department Stores Credit Company and
Payless ShoeSource, Inc. -- has been duly incorporated, is
validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly 

4
<PAGE>
qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the
ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification,
(iii) the performance of this Agreement will not contravene
any provision of the restated certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Company or, to the actual knowledge of such
counsel, any agreement or other instrument binding upon the
Company and no consent, approval or authorization of any
governmental body is required for the performance of this
Agreement, except such as are specified and have been
obtained, and such consents, approvals or authorizations as
may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in
connection with the purchase and distribution of the
Securities by the Underwriters, and (iv) the documents filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act") incorporated by reference in the Prospectus,
when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations
of the Commission thereunder; and he has no reason to believe
that any of such documents when so filed contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made when
such documents were so filed, not misleading. Such opinion
may state that such counsel does not express any opinion or
belief as to the financial statements or other financial data
contained therein. 

(d) You shall have received on the Closing Date from
Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, such
opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to
the validity of the Indenture, the Securities, this Agreement,
the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and other related
matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall
have received such papers and information as they may
reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters. 

(e) You shall have received on the Closing Date, a letter
dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to
you, from Arthur Andersen & Co., independent public
accountants, containing statements and information of the type
ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to
underwriters with respect to the financial statements and
certain financial information contained in or incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus. 

V.

In further consideration of the agreements of the
Underwriters herein contained, the Company covenants as follows: 

5
<PAGE>
(a) To furnish to you without charge three signed copies
of the Registration Statement (including exhibits and
documents incorporated by reference) and to each other
Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without
exhibits but including documents incorporated by reference)
and, during the period mentioned in paragraph (c) below, to
furnish to each Underwriter as many copies of the Prospectus
and any supplements and amendments thereto and any documents
incorporated by reference as you may reasonably request. The
terms "supplement" and "amendment" or "amend" as used in this
Agreement include or refer to all documents filed by the
Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the
Basic Prospectus pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act which are deemed to be incorporated
by reference in the Prospectus from the date of filing such
documents in accordance with Form S-3. 

(b) Before amending or supplementing the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus, to furnish you a copy of each
such proposed amendment or supplement. 

(c) If, during such period after the first date of the
public offering of the Securities as in the opinion of your
counsel the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in
connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event
shall occur as a result of which it is necessary to amend or
supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus
is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is
necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with
law, forthwith to prepare and furnish, at its own expense, to
the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses
you will furnish to the Company) to which Securities may have
been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any
other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements
to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as
so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the
circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser,
be misleading or so that the Prospectus will comply with law. 

(d) To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and
sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request and to pay all
expenses (including fees not exceeding $10,000 and
disbursements of counsel) in connection with such
qualification and in connection with the determination of the
eligibility of the Securities for investment under the laws of
such jurisdictions as you may designate. 

6
<PAGE>
(e) To make generally available to the Company's security
holders as soon as practicable an earnings statement covering
the twelve month period beginning after the date of this
Agreement, which shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a)
of the Act. 

(f) During the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and continuing to and including the Closing Date,
not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of
any debt securities of the Company substantially similar to
the Securities, without your prior written consent. 

VI.

The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter
that (i) each document, if any, filed or to be filed pursuant to
the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
complied or will comply when so filed in all material respects with
such Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) each part
of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, did
not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, (iii) each preliminary
prospectus, if any, filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act
complied when so filed in all material respects with such Act and
the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, (iv) the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply and, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, will comply in all material respects
with the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder
and (v) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not
contain and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; except that these representations and warranties do not
apply to statements or omissions in the Registration Statement, any
preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus based upon information
furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any
Underwriter expressly for use therein. 

The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in
paragraph (c) of Article V hereof and as amended or supplemented if
the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements 

7
<PAGE>
thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information
furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly
for use therein; provided that the foregoing indemnification with
respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any person
controlling such Underwriter) to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the
fact that such Underwriter sold Securities to a person to whom
there was not sent or given, if required by the Act, at or prior to
the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such
person, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated
by reference) correcting the untrue statement or omission of a
material fact if the Company has previously furnished copies
thereof to such Underwriter. 

Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its
officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person
controlling the Company to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with
reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished in
writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you expressly
for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any
preliminary prospectus. 

In case any proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect
of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two
preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall
promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be
sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying
party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the
indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may
designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and
disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any
such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to
retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually
agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties
to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests 

8
<PAGE>
between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall
not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in
the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
counsel necessary for appearing in any proceeding) for all such
indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be
reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in
writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the
second preceding paragraph and by the Company in the case of
parties indemnified pursuant to the immediately preceding
paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent
but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment
for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the
indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason
of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested
an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees
and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the third sentence of
this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be
liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30
business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the
aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have
reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request
prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect
any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect
of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified
party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of
such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the
subject matter of such proceeding. 

If the indemnification provided for in this Article VI is
unavailable to an indemnified party under the second or third
paragraphs hereof or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation
provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted
in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any 

9
<PAGE>
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits
received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be
deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from
the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company
bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received
by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the
cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on
the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 

The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not
be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Article VI
were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters
were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. 
The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of
the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VI, no Underwriter
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it
and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds
the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Article VI
are several in proportion to their respective underwriting
percentages (as defined in the Agreement Among Underwriters) and
not joint. 

The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in
this Article VI and the representations and warranties of the
Company in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force
and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement,
(ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or
any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the 

10
<PAGE>
Company, its directors or officers or any person controlling the
Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the
Securities. 

VII. 

This Agreement shall be subject to termination in your
absolute discretion, by notice given to the Company, if prior to
the Closing Date (i) trading in securities generally on the New
York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange shall have
been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium
on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been
declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iii)
there shall have occurred any material outbreak or escalation of
hostilities or any material adverse change in financial markets
or any calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make
it, in your judgment, impracticable to market the Securities. 

VIII. 

If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or
refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to
purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of
Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than
one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities,
the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the
proportions which the amounts of Securities set forth opposite
the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such
other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities
which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but
failed or refused to purchase; provided that in no event shall
the principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has
agreed to purchase pursuant to Article I hereof be increased
pursuant to this Article VIII by an amount in excess of one-ninth
of such principal amount of Securities without the written
consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters
shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have
agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount
of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more
than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company
for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours
after such default, this Agreement will terminate without
liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the
Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have
the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for
longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if
any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in 

11
<PAGE>
any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action
taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting
Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such
Underwriter under this Agreement. 

If this Agreement shall be terminated by the
Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal
on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill
any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the
Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such
Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to
themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including
the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred
by such Underwriters in connection with the Securities. 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in

8 3/8% DEBENTURE DUE 2024

This Debenture is one of a duly authorized series of debt
securities of the Company (herein called the "Debentures"), issued
under an Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of January 15,
1991 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The
First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (herein called the
"Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the
Indenture), which provides for the issuance by the Company from
time to time of debt securities of the Company (herein called the
"Debt Securities") in one or more series, to which Indenture and
all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a
statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties
and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Debentures and of the terms upon which the
Debentures are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This
Debenture is one of the series designated on the face hereof,
limited in aggregate principal amount to $200,000,000.

The Debentures are subject to retirement by redemption of
$10,000,000 of the principal amount of the Debentures on August 1
of each of the years 2005 to and including 2023 at the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of redemption ("mandatory sinking fund"). The Debentures are
also subject to an optional retirement by redemption, at the
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of redemption of up to an additional $20,000,000
principal amount of Debentures annually, such optional right being
non-cumulative. The Company may (1) deliver outstanding Debentures
(other than Debentures previously called for redemption) and (2)
apply as a credit Debentures which have been acquired or redeemed
either at the election of the Company or through the application of
a permitted optional sinking fund payment, in each case in
satisfaction of all or any part of any required sinking fund
payment, provided that such Debentures have not been previously so
credited. 

The Debentures also will be subject to redemption, at the option of
the Company upon at least 30 and not more than 60 days' notice by
mail, at any time on or after August 1, 2004 and prior to maturity,
as a whole, or from time to time in part, at prices equal to the
percentages of principal amount set forth below, if optionally
redeemed otherwise than through operation of the sinking fund,
during the twelve month period beginning August 1 of the years 
indicated:

and at 100% if redeemed on or after August 1, 2014, together in
each case, with interest accrued and unpaid to the date fixed for
redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on relevant
Record Dates to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date).

If an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures shall occur
and be continuing, the principal amount of the Debentures may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided
in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, 
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the
Debentures under the Indenture and the waiver of compliance by the
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture at any time with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding (or, in case
less than all of the several series of Debt Securities then
Outstanding are affected, of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding of each
affected series). The Indenture also permits the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Debentures at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Debentures, to
waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Debenture shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon
all future Holders of this Debenture and of any Debenture issued
upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or
in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver
is made upon this Debenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (1)
the entire indebtedness of the Debentures and (2) certain
restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default applicable to
the Debentures, upon compliance by the Company with certain
conditions set forth in the Indenture and in an Officers'
Certificate issued pursuant to the Indenture. 

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Debenture or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation
of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of and interest on this Debenture at the times, place and
rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
