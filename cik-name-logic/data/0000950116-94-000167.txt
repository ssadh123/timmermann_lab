Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

Registrant on November 10, 1994 purchased from ARBERN INVESTORS VI, L.P.,
each a Delaware limited partnership ("Arbern VI"), and ARBERN INVESTORS VIII,
L.P., each a Delaware limited partnership ("Arbern VIII") ("Arbern VI and Arbern
VIII are collectively referred to herein as "Seller"), the Boca Palms
Apartments, a 522 unit apartment complex in Boca Raton, Palm Beach County,
Florida for $31,999,000, of which $30,899,000 was allocated to the real estate
and $1,100,000 to the personal property. The apartment complex consists of a
Phase I (226 units), the purchase price of which was $9,055,653 and a Phase II
(296 units), the purchase price of which was $22,943,347. Phase I was sold by
Arbern VI and Phase II was sold by Arbern VIII. In addition, closing costs,
brokers' fees and other expenses paid by Registrant aggregated approximately
$497,150 after apportionments.

The purchase was pursuant to two Agreements of Sale, both dated September
24, 1994 and both amended on November 4, 1994 by and between Robert G. Rogers
and Jonathan B. Weller, as Trustees, and on behalf of all other Trustees of
Registrant and Arbern VI and Arbern VIII, as applicable. The Agreement of Sale
for Phase II was further amended on November 9, 1994. (The Agreement of Sale and
Amendment No. 1 for Phase I are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.8 and made a part
hereof; and the Agreement of Sale and Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 for
Phase II are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.9 and made a part hereof.) There is
no relationship between any Trustee, officer or affiliate of the Registrant and
any known partner of the Seller.

Registrant paid cash of $31,899,000 and issued two zero coupon notes with a
total present value of $100,000 and future value in thirty years of $1,700,000
for the apartment complex, borrowing all the required proceeds from CoreStates
Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as agent. The borrowing totaled
$32,500,000, which included the purchase price, closing costs, 1994 real estate
taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection with
the acquisition. Of the amount borrowed, $32,000,000 is secured by real estate
other than the Boca Palms Apartments complex with the balance of $500,000
unsecured. The loan agreement provides that the loan shall bear interest at
Registrant's option, at (i) the Prime Rate or the federal funds effective rate
plus 0.5% or (ii) Adjusted LIBOR plus 2.0%. The scheduled maturity date of the
loan is the earlier of (1) November 10, 1995 or (2) one business day after
Registrant's receipt of the net proceeds from an offering of its equity
securities. Both loans are general obligations of Registrant. The average
accreted interest during the first 10 years on the zero coupon notes is $16,619
per year.

Registrant anticipates spending an additional $2,100,000 for closing
costs, landscaping, new leasing models, apartment upgrades, and other
enhancements to the public areas of the apartment complex over the next year.

Location: The Boca Palms Apartments are located on a 35 acre site
south of the Palmetto Parkway on Route 441; 22573 Southwest 66th Avenue, Boca
Raton, Palm Beach County, Florida 33428.

The apartments are generally rented for a term of one year and then
automatically renew on a month-to-month basis. The occupancy rate was 93% on
November 10, 1994.

Competition: There are numerous apartment and condominium complexes in the
immediate vicinity of Boca Palms Apartments, a few of which have been
constructed within the past five years. Of the competing apartment complexes,
some have monthly rents which are higher and some have monthly rents which are
lower. The population in the area in which Boca Palms Apartments is located is
expected to grow by 22% through 1999.

Environmental: Registrant had a Phase I environmental study performed prior
to its acquisition of Boca Palms Apartments. The property was also tested for
Radon gas. Registrant will perform additional tests in an effort to determine if
the level of Radon gas is within federal and state guidelines. If Radon is found
to be above the federal and state guidelines, Registrant will remediate the
Radon. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it has
accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present health risks to
persons who are exposed to it over time.

Management Arrangement: The apartment complex will be managed by the
Registrant.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of revenues and certain expenses of
Boca Palms Apartments for the year ended August 31, 1994. This financial
statement is the responsibility of Boca Palms Apartments' management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statement is free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statement. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1, the accompanying statement of revenues and certain
expenses was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be
a complete presentation of Boca Palms Apartments' revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the financial statement referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the revenues and certain expenses of Boca Palms

NOTE TO STATEMENT OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN EXPENSES

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

The statement of revenues and certain expenses (the "financial statement")
reflects the operations of Boca Palms Apartments (the "Property"), a 522-unit
apartment complex located in Boca Raton, Florida. The last phase of development
in the apartment complex, which consists of 296 units, was started in 1990 and
was completed during the year ended August 31, 1994. As a result, certain
portions of the units were still in the lease-up phase during several months in
the year ended August 31, 1994. The Property was acquired by Pennsylvania Real
Estate Investment Trust (the "Trust") from unaffiliated parties on November 10,
1994.

The accompanying financial statement, prepared in accordance with certain rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, excludes certain
expenses such as interest, depreciation and amortization, and other costs not
directly related to the future operations of the Property that may not be
comparable to the expenses expected to be incurred by the Trust in the proposed
future operations of the Property. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those
rules and regulations, although the Trust believes that the disclosures made are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

Item 7.(b) PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION (1)

The following Pro Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet as of August 31, 1994, and
the Pro Forma Consolidating Statements of Operations for the year ended August
31, 1994, have been prepared to reflect the acquisition transaction and the
adjustments described in the accompanying notes. The pro forma financial
information is based on the historical financial statements and should be read
in conjunction with the notes and management's assumptions thereto. The Pro
Forma Consolidating Balance Sheet was prepared as if the acquisition transaction
occurred on August 31, 1994. The pro forma financial information is unaudited
and not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results which actually would
have occurred if the acquisition transaction had been consummated at the
beginning of fiscal year 1994, nor does it purport to represent the future
financial position and results of operations for future periods.

TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA

CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust ("the Trust") acquired Boca Palms
Apartments (the "Property"), a 522-unit apartment complex located in Boca Raton,
Florida, for a purchase price of $32,500,000, which included closing and other
costs of approximately $500,000 and $100,000 of two zero coupon notes which are
due to the seller in thirty years in the amount of $1,700,000. Interest expense
related to these notes will be accreted over the thirty-year period at an
interest rate of 9.56%. The last phase of development in the apartment complex,
which consists of 296 units, was started in 1990 and was completed during the
year ended August 31, 1994. As a result, certain portions of the units were
still in the lease-up phase during several months in the year ended August 31,
1994. The Trust acquired the Property by borrowing the $32,500,000 required
purchase price from a financial institution.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidating balance sheet is presented as
if the acquisition transaction occurred on August 31, 1994.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations is
presented as if the acquisition transaction had been made as of September 1,
1993.

These pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
historical financial statements and notes thereto as of August 31, 1994. In
management's opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the
acquisition of the Property by the Trust have been made.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are not necessarily
indicative of the actual financial position as of August 31, 1994, or what the
actual results of operations of the Trust would have been assuming the
acquisition of the Property had been completed as of September 1, 1993, nor are
they indicative of the results of operations for future periods.

5.5 No Lawsuits. There are no claims, lawsuits or proceedings pending,
or to the best of the Seller's knowledge, threatened against or relating to
Seller or the Property, or which could affect them, or any of them, in any court
or before any governmental agency (whether or not covered by Seller's liability
insurance), except for actions for possession, damages and or rent against

<PAGE> 13

option to renew except for renewal of leases coming due prior to November 30,
1994, extend, cancel or terminate its Lease, or to purchase its demised premises
or any other property. No tenant has asserted that Seller is in default under
any of the Leases or asserted any claim or basis for any claim for free or
reduced rent or right of setoff against the landlord or the rent under the
Leases, and Seller and its agent have no knowledge of any default or any event
which has taken place which, with the passage of time, or the delivery of
notice, or both, could become an event of default. Seller has the sole right to
collect any rents under the Leases, or the delivery of notice, or both, and
neither such right nor any of the Leases has been assigned, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise encumbered by Seller except as additional collateral
for the existing mortgage upon the Premises which shall be satisfied at Closing.

required by law or otherwise applicable, interest which has accrued in
accordance with law. No tenant or other person has any right or option to
acquire the Premises, or any part thereof, or to terminate any of the rights
currently appurtenant to the Premises, and there are no restrictive covenants in
any leases. No tenant of the Premises under any of the Leases has, and shall not
at Closing have, prepaid any rent under any of the Leases for more than one (1)
month. Except as otherwise set forth on Exhibit "D", no security deposits and
prepaid rent by tenants have heretofore been returned or applied to charges
against the tenants.

use thereof comply with all requirements of federal, state and local law, and
all requirements of all governmental bodies or agencies having jurisdiction
thereof; no portion of the Property lies within a flood plain or wetland except

waste materials, and there has been no use of the Premises that may, under any
federal, state or local environmental statute, ordinance or regulation, require,
at any time, any closure or cessation of the use or occupancy of the Premises
and/or impose, at any time, upon the owner of the Premises any clean-up or other
monetary obligation. Seller hereby further represents and warrants that it has
not been identified in any litigation, administrative proceeding or
investigation as a responsible party or potentially responsible party for any
liability for clean-up costs, natural resource damages or other damages or
liability for prior disposal or release of Hazardous Substances, Hazardous
Wastes or other environmental pollutants or contaminants, and that no lien or
superlien has been recorded, filed or otherwise asserted against any real or
personal property of Seller for any clean-up costs or other responses costs
incurred in connection with any environmental contamination that is
attributable, in whole or in part, to Seller. Seller hereby indemnifies and
holds Buyer harmless from any and all liability, loss or damage suffered or
incurred as a result of a claim, demand, cost or judgment in favor of a third
party, including, without limitation, any governmental authority, arising from
the deposit, storage, disposal, burial, dumping, injecting, spilling, leaking,
or other placement or release in or on the Premises of Hazardous Substances or
Wastes. For purposes of this Agreement, "Hazardous Substances" means those
elements and compounds which are designated as such in Section 101(14) of the
Comprehensive Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.

unintentional action or omission on Seller's part which (a) resulted in the

Priorities List (40 C.F.R. Part 300, App. B) or any state or local list of
potential hazardous waste disposal sites. Seller has conducted a complete and
thorough inspection and test of the underground storage tanks located on the
Premises, if any, and Seller has confirmed that the results thereof show
compliance with all requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA"), 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq. and all other applicable federal, state or
local laws and Seller has taken all other necessary and appropriate action to
comply fully therewith. A true, correct and complete copy of all such test
results, together with any required tank registrations, have heretofore or shall
immediately hereafter be supplied to Buyer. Seller represents and warrants that
there are no wetlands or fresh-water wetlands on the Premises as those terms are
defined in applicable state and/or federal laws, nor are there any other
environmental features present on the Premises which would inhibit Buyer's
intended development and use of the Premises.

respective terms, and no party thereto is in default, and no claim of default by

or any other property. No tenant has asserted that Seller is in default under
any of the Leases or asserted any claim or basis for any claim for free or
reduced rent or right of setoff against the landlord or the rent under the
Leases, and Seller and its agent have no knowledge of any default or any event
which has taken place which, with the passage of time, or the delivery of
notice, or both, could become an event of default. Seller has the sole right to
collect any rents under the Leases, or the delivery of notice, or both, and
neither such right nor any of the Leases has been assigned, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise encumbered by Seller except as additional collateral

accordance with law. No tenant or other person has any right or option to
acquire the Premises, or any part thereof, or to terminate any of the rights
currently appurtenant to the Premises, and there are no restrictive covenants in
any leases. No tenant of the Premises under any of the Leases has, and shall
not at Closing have, prepaid any rent under any of the Leases for more than one
(1) month. Except as otherwise set forth on Exhibit "D", no security deposits
and prepaid rent by tenants have heretofore been returned or applied to charges
against the tenants.

monetary obligation. Seller hereby further represents and warrants that it has

investigation as a responsible party or potentially responsible party for any
liability for clean-up costs, natural resource damages or other damages or
liability for prior disposal or release of Hazardous Substances, Hazardous

local laws and Seller has taken all other necessary and appropriate action to
comply fully therewith. A true, correct and complete copy of all such test
results, together with any required tank registrations, have heretofore or shall
immediately hereafter be supplied to Buyer. Seller represents and warrants that
