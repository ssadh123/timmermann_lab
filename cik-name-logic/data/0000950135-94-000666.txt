FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- - ---------------------
November 4, 1994

Acton, Mass., November 4, 1994--CML Group, Inc. (NYSE: CML), announced
today the filing of a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District court for the
District of Massachusetts against the company and its Chairman, Charles M.
Leighton, and President, G. Robert Tod, by four purported stockholders, Mark
Levine, Stan Ferraro, Jack Rosenthal and Michael Bradwell, owning an aggregate
of 2,400 shares. The complaint alleges that the company failed to properly
disclose the extent of its NordicTrack advertising expenditures and the impact
of those expenditures on its future operating results, and constituted
misleading statements regarding the company's business and operations in
violation of federal securities laws.

Responding to the lawsuit, Mr. Leighton stated that "the complaint
contains factually incorrect statements, the allegations are without merit, and
the defendants intend to vigorously contest the lawsuit."
