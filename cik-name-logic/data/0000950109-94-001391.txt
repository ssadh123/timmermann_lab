Refugio Project Financing

Amax Gold Inc.'s Chilean subsidiary Compania Minera Maricunga ("CMM"),
owned 50% by the Company and 50% by Bema Gold Corporation, has received
commitments from a group of international banks for a project loan of
approximately US$80 million for the construction of the Verde deposit of the
Refugio Project in central Chile.

The loan would be provided by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
Credit Lyonnais Canada, Deutsche Bank and NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd. and is
subject to closing documentation, final technical due diligence and equity
requirements. In addition, the bank commitments are subject a number of
conditions, including that CMM raise either approximately $40 million of
equity capital or approximately $35 million of equity capital and approximately
$5 million of additional debt financing. A draw down of the loan could occur as
early as October 1994. There can be no assurance that the conditions set
forth in the commitment letters, including that CMM obtain additional financing,
will be satisfied.

Total costs to develop the Refugio Project are estimated at US$120
million to US$130 million. Construction is presently scheduled to commence
in October 1994, with the first gold pour in early 1996. Flour Daniel Chile
commenced project engineering in June 1994.

Business Discussions

Amax Gold from time to time engages in discussions with other gold
companies about the possibility of a business combination. Recently the Company
and its advisors engaged in preliminary discussions with LAC Minerals Ltd.
("LAC") and its advisors about the possibility of a business combination between
Amax Gold and LAC. These discussions are not currently being pursued by the
Company or its advisors. The Company is aware of a number of other business
combination proposals pending with respect to LAC. No assurance can be given
that the Company will not resume discussions with respect to a business
combination with LAC or another company in the future.

Compania Minera Maricunga
SUMMARY INDICATIVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The Project: The development, construction and mining of ore from the
Verde Gold Project (the "Project"), with development to
occur in accordance with the Revised Feasibility Study
prepared by Mineral Resource Development Inc. ("MRDI")
in December 1992 ("Revised Feasibility Study"), the
Updated Capital and Operating Cost Estimate prepared by
MRDI in February 1994 ("Updated Costs Report") and any
amendments thereto approved by the Technical Agent in
consultation with the Lenders. The Project is located in
North Central Chile.

Capital Cost: The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$120 
Million.

Project Ownership: The Project is owned by Compania Minera Maricunga
("CMM") a Chilean mining company. CMM is owned as
follows:-

50% by Amax Gold Refugio, Inc. ("AGRI") a wholly owned
Delaware subsidiary of Amax Gold Inc. ("AGI"), by virtue
of AGRI's ownership of 100% of the Class B shares of
CMM; and

50% by Bema Gold (Bermuda) Ltd. ("Bema Bermuda"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Bema Gold Corporation
("Bema") by virtue of Bema Bermuda's ownership of 100%
of the Class A shares of CMM.

Borrower: CMM, or an agreed upon Chilean Qualified Financial
Institution ("QFI"). The QFI will be approved by the
Chilean Central Bank and would only be used to
facilitate the initial dollar/gold conversion of the
loan and to expedite the Chilean Approval process.

Guarantors: AGI and Bema on a several basis, in proportion to their
ownership of CMM, until Economic Completion. Should the
current ownership interests change (with the consent of
the Lenders) whilst the Guarantees are outstanding then
the size of the Guarantees will be automatically
adjusted to account for the revised ownership structure.

Operator: CMM, with AGI maintaining Chairmanship of the Board of
CMM and the Technical Management Committee as governed
by the CMM Shareholder's Agreement dated 18th November,
1992 ("Shareholder's Agreement") between AGI and Bema
and any amendments thereto approved by the Lenders.

Purpose: Exclusively to finance a portion of the construction and
development costs of the Project and its initial working
capital requirements.

Facility Amount: US$ 85 million, or the gold ounce equivalent thereof 
(the "Facility"), which will be available in a single 
drawdown to occur no later than [ date ].

For the avoidance of doubt, any drawings denominated in 
gold ounces will be deemed to be at the price of 
drawdown for the purposes of subsequent conversion and 
monetary cap provisions.

Administrative Agent N M Rothschild & Sons Limited

Technical Agent: Deutsche Bank

Co-Arrangers & Lenders
(the "Lenders"):
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
Credit Lyonnais
Deutsche Bank
ING Capital Corporation
N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd

Facility Type: Amortising Term Loan Facility available in US Dollars 
and/or Gold.
Dollar/Gold
Conversion: The Borrower, may at its option, in whole or in part, 
convert borrowings from a Gold Loan to a Dollar Loan, or
vice versa, at any time on an interest rate
maturity/rollover date, subject to a minimum notice
period of 30 days, and further provided that no more
than two such conversions may occur within any 12 month
period; and that upon any conversion not more than one
tranche is denominated in US Dollars and not more than
one tranche is denominated in gold ounces; and that at
no time would such conversion result in aggregate
outstandings exceeding the Facility Amount adjusted for
Scheduled Repayments and Prepayments.

For the purpose of calculating the conversion of gold
drawings into US Dollar drawings, the conversion price
will be the price at which the gold loan was originally
drawn down, or if subsequently converted from US Dollars
into gold ounces, the price at which the conversion took
place.

<PAGE>

3

Availability: From the date of execution of a definitive loan
agreement and the satisfaction of all Conditions
Precedent up to the earlier of [ date ] and Economic
Completion.

Construction Account: All loan proceeds will be deposited in a segregated 
offshore account (the "Construction Account"). Drawdowns
from the Construction Account will be for the sole
purpose of meeting an agreed construction expenditure
schedule as specified in the Engineering, Procurement,
and Construction Contract (the "EPC Contract") and other
project related costs in accordance with the budget
approved by the Technical Agent in consultation with the
Lenders, following the review by an independent
engineering firm (the "Approved Budget") appointed by
the Lenders (the "Independent Engineer").

Drawdowns under the Facility will be supported by a
monthly project Certificate which will detail the costs
incurred to-date, and confirm adhesion to the Approved
Budget, that there has been no technical development
which would or could materially adversely affect the
performance of the Project ( all of which will be
confirmed by the Independent Engineer) and that no
default exists or upon such drawdown would occur, under
any agreement.

Once the Project has attained Economic Completion any
funds remaining in the Construction Account, shall be
immediately be applied as a Mandatory Prepayment of the
-----------------------------------------
Facility.
---------
Scheduled
Repayments: Mandatory repayment of the Facility will occur in ten, 
equal semi-annual installments commencing six months
after full Mechanical Completion (i.e. achievement of
Phase B of the Mechanical Completion Test under the EPC
contract), but no later than [ date ].
Accelerated
Prepayments: To the extent permissible under Chilean Law (to be 
clarified prior to execution of full loan
documentation), commencing six months after Mechanical
Completion (i.e. achievement of Phase B of the
Mechanical Completion Test under the EPC contract), but
no later than [ date ], and on every repayment date
thereafter the net cashflow after interest and Scheduled
Repayments and after the required Capex and Debt Service
Reserves, remaining in the Proceeds Account (the "Excess
------------
Cashflow"), shall be applied against
------------------------------------
<PAGE>

4

Scheduled Repayments in inverse order of maturity, as 
----------------------------------------------------- 
follows:
-------

33.3% of the first US$10 million of Excess Cashflow and
-------------------------------------------------------
thereafter 50% of any additional Excess Cashflow.
------------------------------------------------

Monetary Cap: In the event that the aggregate market price of
outstandings under the facility denominated in gold
ounces exceeds the price at which such ounces were
originally drawn down by more than 33 1/3% for a period
of 20 consecutive days or 50% on any one Business Day
(the "Monetary Cap") then the Borrower shall be
required, to either:-

a) prepay such amounts as necessary to reduce the
aggregate outstandings to a level below the
Monetary Cap such payments being applied in inverse
------------------------------------- 
order of maturity, or
------------------ 

b) provide collateral acceptable to the Lenders of an
equivalent value, or

c) convert all outstandings denominated in gold ounces
into US Dollars at the price at which such
outstandings were originally drawn (or subsequently
converted).

Mandatory prepayment
upon Loan Conversion: To the extent that the Borrower realises any gains
through the conversion of outstandings from gold ounces
to US Dollars and vice versa, such gains shall
immediately be applied to prepayment of the Facility, in
inverse order of maturity.

Cancellation: The Borrower may cancel any undrawn portion of the
Facility prior to Economic Completion, provided that the
Lenders are satisfied with the capacity of the Borrower
to achieve Economic Completion by no later than [date]
(the "Completion Date").

Prepayment: To the extent permissible under Chilean Law (such issue
to be clarified prior to the execution of full loan
documentation), the Borrower may make optional
prepayments of outstandings under the Facility providing
that such prepayments occur on the Scheduled Repayment
Dates, that a five day notice period of prepayment has
been given by the Borrower and that such prepayments are
in minimum multiples of US$5 million or the gold
equivalent thereof.

<PAGE>
5

Any prepayments will be applied against outstandings 
under the facility in inverse order of maturity and will
include full reimbursement of any "breakage" cost 
incurred by the Lenders as a result of such prepayment.

Denomination of
Principal Repayments
and Prepayments: Any principal Repayment or Prepayment relating to 
outstandings denominated in gold ounces shall be made in
gold ounces and any principal Repayment or Prepayment 
relating to outstandings denominated in US Dollars shall
be made in US Dollars.

Construction Contract: The Borrower will enter into an EPC Contract, upon 
terms, and with a major international engineering 
company acceptable to the Lenders (the "Construction 
Contractor").

The Construction Contractor will guarantee, inter alia, 
that:-

(i) The Project will be developed and constructed in 
accordance with the Revised Feasibility Study, the
Updated Costs Report and Development Plan and
subsequent agreed engineering studies, as approved
by the Technical Agent in consultation with the
Lenders and the Independent Engineer.

(ii) The Project will be developed and constructed by 
a certain date for an agreed upon total cost. Both
the date and the total cost will be defined in the
EPC Contract, together with penalties up to an 
agreed amount.

(iii) The Project will be completed including the 
installation and construction of plant, equipment 
and services and the passing of certain physical
processing capability tests, as agreed with and 
approved by the Technical Agent in consultation 
with the Lenders following a review by the 
Independent Engineer ("Mechanical Completion").

Mining Contract: The Borrower will enter into a mining contract (the 
"Mining Contract"), with a mining company (the "Mining
Contractor") acceptable to the Lenders and upon terms 
and with any amendments thereto, acceptable to the 
Lenders. The Mining Contract will stipulate, inter alia,
a maximum cost per tonne of material moved.

<PAGE>

The Mining Contract will operate in accordance with the
Development Plan resulting from the Revised Feasibility
Study or any agreed modifications thereto. The Mining
Contract will have a minimum fixed duration of four
years with the Borrower's option to extend the mining
Contract thereafter.

Conditions relating
to the Contract Mining: a) In the event that the Mining Contract expires or is
----------
cancelled (for whatever reason) by the Borrower or
the Mining Contractor it will be an obligation of
the Borrower upon terms no worse than the original
Mining Contract to either:-

i) immediately continue the mining operation with
its own workforce and equipment. In such a
situation, it will be an obligation of the
Borrower to provide the necessary funding for
the mining operations, without this in any way
diminishing or otherwise affecting the other
obligations of the Borrower under the Facility;
or

ii) to exercise its option to take over, at a
reasonable cost, the Mining Contractor's
equipment and workforce. Such option not to be
overruled by the Mining Contractor's obligations
to third parties.

b) The Mining Contract, will include, inter alia:-

i) Performance bonding for the Mining Contractor in
favour of the Borrower.

ii) Appropriate insurance of the Mining Contractor
(i.e. loss of or damage to equipment and
production interruption).

iii) The ability of the Borrower to contract out
through the Performance Bonding if necessary.

iv) The obligation of the Mining Contractor to
conduct his operation, particularly regarding
human and industrial relations, in such a
manner so as to avoid to the extent possible
interruptions of work arising from strikes or
other willful actions (limitation of acceptance
of force majeure).

<PAGE>

7

v) A termination clause for extraordinary cancellation
of the Contract by the Borrower in the case of
wilful misconduct by the Mining Contractor and/or
in the case of technical and/or economic jeopardy
of the Project.

Hedging: The Borrower will be required to maintain (either
directly or through assignment by the respective
Shareholders) sufficient gold price hedging, with
counterparties acceptable to the Lenders, to cover
operating costs, on-going capital expenditures and debt
service, on a two-and-a-half year rolling basis, until
12 months after the final projected maturity date of the
Facility, as reflected in the Development Plan, but in
any event committed gold price hedging (i.e. hedging
where the Borrower is obliged to deliver a fixed number
of ounces at fixed price on a specific date--"Committed
Hedging") should at no times exceed 50% of forecast
production in any one Period.

The Borrower will also be required (either directly or
through assignment by the respective Shareholders) to
establish Interest rate protection satisfactory to the
Lenders.

Proceeds Account: All gold production shall immediately be sold outside of
Chile and the sale proceeds deposited in a segregated
offshore bank account (the "Proceeds Account"). The
Proceeds Account shall have a minimum balance at all
times post Economic Completion, equal to Scheduled Debt
Service (the "Debt Service Reserve") and forecast
capital expenditures (the "Capex Reserve") for the next
six months, as contemplated in the Development Plan.

Withdrawals from the Proceeds Account will be applied
firstly to agreed expenditures contemplated in the
Development Plan, Scheduled Debt Service and taxes, the
Debt Service and Capex Reserves. Thereafter withdrawals
may be made for Accelerated Prepayments and then
Dividend Payments.

Dividend Payments may only be made however, on an annual
basis and then only if the Borrower and Guarantors are
in full compliance with all of the covenants, and that
the making of a Dividend Payment would not result in a
breach of any of the covenants. Under no circumstances
may be made prior to the achievement of Economic
Completion.

Foreign Investment
Contract: The CMM Shareholders will maintain their Foreign 
Investment Contract (Decree Law 600) with the State of 
Chile in a form and substance acceptable to the Lenders.

Completion Guarantees: In addition to the EPC Contractor's guarantees, AGI will
fund 100% of all cost overruns to Mechanical Completion.

Until the Project has achieved Economic Completion
through the passing of a Completion Test (the parameters
of which are to be determined) together with evidence
that a balance has been built up in the Proceeds Account
sufficient to fund the next six months Scheduled Debt
Service and capital expenditure, AGI and Bema, will, on
a several basis in proportion to their ownership
interest in CMM, unconditionally guarantee all
obligations of the Borrower.

It shall be a condition of each Completion Guarantee
that Economic Completion be achieved by no later than
[ date ].

Whilst the initial guarantees shall each represent 50%
of the Facility Amount, should there be any subsequent
amendment to AGI and Bema's ownership interests in CMM
(with the consent of the Lenders, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), then either AGI or Bema's
percentage liability under such guarantee shall either
decrease or increase on a pro rata basis commensurate
with the percentage ownership change.

Once Economic Completion has been achieved, the Facility
will become non-recourse to AGI and Bema, except with
respect to ongoing environmental warranties.

Interest: Interest will be levied on a floating rate basis at a
margin over US$ LIBOR and/or US$ LIBOR minus GOFO (in
the case of gold drawings) of:-

2.875% per annum Pre Economic Completion*

2.500% per annum Post Economic Completion**

The Borrower may select Interest periods of 1, 2, 3, or
6 months, or other such periods as may be agreed between
the Borrower and Lenders from time to time. All interest
payments will be made net of encaje, taxes, duties or
other withholdings, on the last day of each interest
period. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payments on
any outstandings denominated in gold ounces will be
payable in gold ounces, and interest on any outstandings
denominated in US Dollars will be payable in US Dollars.

(* The pre-completion margin of 2.875% p.a. is a blended
rate reflecting the relative perceived creditworthiness
of the Guarantors, as follows:-
AGI 1.75% p.a.
Bema 4.00% p.a.)

(**The Post-Completion margin of 2.500% p.a. is based on
the Lenders being able to secure acceptable Political
Risk Insurance as required, at a cost of 0.750% p.a.
Should the cost of such Insurance be in excess of 0.750%
then the Post-Completion margin shall be increased
accordingly to compensate those Lenders to whom such
excess cost applies.)

Fees: i) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender a Participation
Fee of 1.50% flat based upon each Lender's commitment to
the Facility. The Borrower shall pay each Lender 50% of
its Participation Fee upon receipt and acceptance of a
firm commitment letter, and the Balance at Facility
Closing. In the event that Borrower elects not to
proceed with the Facility, then the 50% paid by the
Borrower upon acceptance of a commitment shall be non-
refundable.

ii) The Borrower shall pay, quarterly in arrears, a
Commitment Fee of 0.375% per annum on any available but
undrawn amounts under the Facility from the earlier of 
[date] and the date of Facility closing.
