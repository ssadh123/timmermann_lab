On April 25, 1994, the following news release was issued:

UNOCAL POSTS $54 MILLION EARNINGS
FOR FIRST QUARTER 1994
------------------------------------

Los Angeles, April 25 -- Unocal Corporation today said its net earnings
for the first quarter 1994 were $54 million, or 19 cents per common share.
This compares with earnings of $11 million, or one cent per common share for
the same period a year ago.
Excluding the effect of special items (detailed in attached table),
Unocal's earnings for the first quarter 1994 were $62 million, or 22 cents
per common share, compared with $98 million, or 37 cents per common share
the year before.
Richard J. Stegemeier, Unocal chairman and chief executive officer,
said the first quarter operating results reflected the steep decline in
crude oil prices from a year ago, which were offset partially by increased
natural gas revenues due to higher domestic prices and production.
Special items in the first quarter included the proceeds from the
settlement of the Mesa lawsuit arising from the takeover attempt in 1985 and
various oil and gas asset sales. These gains were more than offset by the
write down of investment and provisions for abandonment and remediation of
the Guadalupe oil field on the central California coast and provisions for
various legal issues. Earlier the company had announced that a charge would
be taken in the first quarter to provide fully for abandonment and
remediation of the Guadalupe field. This charge covers remediation and
clean up efforts that are now under way at the field.
"In the first quarter, we saw continued increases in Unocal's worldwide
natural gas and crude oil production as a result of our accelerated
development efforts," Stegemeier said. "Domestic natural gas production was
13 percent above the fourth quarter 1993. Foreign gas production was also
above the fourth quarter 1993 level by 12 percent."
The company said it expects total production of natural gas to average
about 1,800 million cubic feet per day during the full-year 1994, up nearly
6 percent from the 1993 level. Total production should grow to almost 2,000
million cubic feet per day by 1996, driven by higher production from the
Gulf of Mexico area and Thailand.

Stegemeier also said that crude oil and condensate production has been
more directly affected by the lower oil prices. He said if the West Texas 
Intermediate price remains in the $15 per barrel range, the company would 
expect oil production to remain at about the current level through 1996. If 
oil prices recover to $18 per barrel, however, Unocal's production could 
increase to 280,000 barrels per day by 1996, Stegemeier said.
Cash flows from operations in the first quarter, before working capital
changes, were $350 million, down slightly from $363 million last year. The
effect of lower crude oil prices was largely offset by higher gas revenues
and the Mesa lawsuit settlement.
Stegemeier noted that Unocal's worldwide average crude oil sales price
was $11.32 per barrel in the first quarter, down from $14.90 per barrel
during the same period of 1993. The company's worldwide average natural gas
sales price was $2.04 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), compared with $1.89 per
mcf a year ago.
First quarter revenues were $1.92 billion, down from $2.32 billion in
1993. The lower revenues were due to the sale of businesses in 1993 and the
continuing phase out of Southeast U.S. retail gasoline marketing.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $264 million, up from
$192 million a year ago. The increase reflected Unocal's accelerated
exploration and development program in Louisiana and Alaska's Cook Inlet, as
well as refinery construction to prepare for manufacturing reformulated
gasoline. Exploration and dry hole expense for the quarter totaled $49
million, up from $35 million in the first quarter 1993.

PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
- ------------------------------------
First quarter 1994 earnings from petroleum exploration and production
totaled $71 million, compared with $142 million in 1993. Excluding special
charges related to the Guadalupe oil field and gains from asset sales,
petroleum exploration and production earnings were $87 million, compared
with $120 million during the same period a year ago.
The results reflected lower worldwide crude oil prices and higher
domestic natural gas prices and production.
Net worldwide crude oil and condensate production for the first quarter
averaged 257,100 barrels per day, up from 252,900 barrels per day a year
ago. First quarter daily worldwide natural gas production averaged 1,804
million cubic feet in 1994, up 10 percent from 1,637 million cubic feet in
1993.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION
- --------------------------------------
First quarter earnings for Unocal's refining, marketing and
transportation segment totaled $41 million, compared with $48 million in
1993. For the quarter, margins on refined product sales were slightly
lower.

<PAGE>

In the first quarter, sales of petroleum products averaged 306,200
barrels per day, down from 379,900 barrels per day the previous year. The
sale of the company's Auto/TruckStop system and the continuing phase out of
Southeast U.S. retail gasoline marketing contributed to the lower product
sales. However, the company's West Coast U.S. petroleum product sales
volumes increased 7 percent to 240,000 barrels per day in the first quarter
1994, up from 224,200 barrels per day a year ago.

CHEMICALS
- ---------
Unocal's chemicals segment recorded earnings in the first quarter of $9
million, compared with $12 million a year ago. The results reflected lower
earnings from agricultural products.

GEOTHERMAL
- ----------
First quarter 1994 geothermal earnings were $5 million, compared with
$32 million a year ago. The 1993 first quarter included a $26 million gain
from the sale of the company's Imperial Valley (California) geothermal
assets and other geothermal exploration properties.

CORPORATE AND OTHER
- -------------------
Net expense for corporate and other was $72 million in the first
quarter 1994. This compares with $93 million in the same period in 1993.
Adjusted for special items, net expense for corporate and other was $80
million in 1994, versus $89 million for the same period a year ago.
The decrease reflected lower net interest expense and a reduction in
administrative and general expense.
