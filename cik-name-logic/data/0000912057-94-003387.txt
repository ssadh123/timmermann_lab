FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWESTERN LIFE CORPORATION ANNOUNCES MANAGEMENT CHANGE;
RESTATES 1994 FIRST QUARTER AND SIX MONTH FINANCIAL RESULTS.

DALLAS--OCT. 12, 1994--Southwestern Life Corporation (ASE: SLC), a Dallas-
based insurance holding company, today announced that Robert L. Beisenherz has
resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Company. The
Company's Board of Directors also announced that it was evaluating potential
acquisitions and strategic alliances designed to increase insurance premium
income and reduce operational expenses, and had elected James R. Kerber to the
Board and as president and chief executive officer of the Company.

Mr. Kerber, 62, has 35 years management experience in the life insurance
industry. For the past five years he has served as senior executive vice
president-operations of Life Partners Group, Inc. in Denver, Colo.

The Company also today announced it has restated its financial results for
the first quarter ended Mar. 31, 1994 and six months ended June 30, 1994 to
account for realized losses in certain of its collateralized mortgage
obligation (CMO) investments previously accounted for as unrealized losses
through a charge to stockholders' equity. The restatements resulted from a
reevaluation of the particular CMO investments by the Company and, at the
Company's request, its independent auditors. As a result of

1
<PAGE>

such reevaluation, management determined that the unrealized losses represented
"other than temporary" declines in the fair values of such investments and that
a realization of the losses through a charge to earnings was appropriate.

Under current statutory accounting standards, the write-downs have no
effect upon the Company's operating cash flows or upon the statutory financial
results of its insurance subsidiaries.

The Company reported a restated net loss, after preferred dividend
requirements, of $43.7 million, or 91 cents per common share, in the first
quarter of 1994, reflecting pre-tax losses totaling $46.4 million in its
investment in CMOs evidenced by its interests in a trust sponsored by an
unaffiliated third party, the Fund America Investors Corporation II ("Fund
America"), and its rights to residual interests held by a special-purpose trust,
the Secured Investors Structured Trust ("SIST"), which had been sponsored by the
Company. The Company had previously reported a net loss, after preferred
dividend requirements, of $8.5 million, or 18 cents per common share, in the
first quarter of 1994.

For the six months ended June 30, 1994, the Company reported a restated net
loss, after preferred dividend requirements, of $42.5 million, or 89 cents per
common share. The Company had previously reported a net loss, after preferred
dividend requirements of $7.3 million, or 15 cents per common share, for the
first half of 1994.

The Company had not previously tax-effected any of its unrealized
investment losses at Mar. 31, 1994 or June 30, 1994. In

2
<PAGE>

conjunction with its reevaluation of the CMOs, a determination was made that a
substantial portion of the write-downs could be tax-effected. As a consequence
of the tax-effecting of the write-downs, common equity was revised upwards to
$125.4 million, or $2.65 per share, as of June 30, 1994. Common equity had been
previously reported to be $114.2 million, or $2.42 per share, at June 30, 1994.

The carrying value of the two investments at June 30, 1994 was $31.2
million, although the undiscounted future cash flows exceeded $300 million at
the same date. The securities underlying the Fund America investment are the
principal components ($102 million) of bonds ("RFCO Strips") issued by the
Resolution Funding Corporation, whose sole purpose is to provide financing for
the federal government's Resolution Trust Corporation. The RFCO Strips are due
in full in a single payment in 2030. According to the Offering Circular for the
RFCO Strips, the principal amount of the RFCO Strips will be fully repaid from
the proceeds of non-interest bearing obligations of the United States issued by
the Secretary of the Treasury and deposited in a separate account at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.

The securities underlying the SIST residual are the principal components
($14.5 million) of RFCO Strips due in full in 2021.

The Company said that amended Form 10-Qs for the periods ended Mar. 31,
1994 and June 30, 1994, would be promptly filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

A preliminary review of the Fund America investment and SIST residual as
of Sept. 30, 1994 under applicable GAAP standards and interpretations indicates
that no further realized losses as of that date will be required.
