For Immediate Release
Tuesday, July 19, 1994

NEW YORK, July 19 -- Chemical Banking Corporation today
reported second quarter net income of $357 million, or $1.28 per
common share, up nine percent from earnings on a comparable basis of
$327 million, or $1.14 per share, in the second quarter of 1993.

Reported net income in last year's second quarter was $381
million, or $1.35 per share, when Chemical recognized income tax
benefits of $54 million.

For the first six months of 1994, net income was $676 million,
an increase of 12 percent from $603 million on a comparable basis in
the first half of 1993. Reported net income for the first six
months of 1993 was $755 million, when the corporation benefited from
$152 million in accounting changes and tax benefits.

"Chemical's core businesses performed well in the second
quarter's challenging environment. Our earnings also benefited from
a further improvement in the institution's risk profile, including a
substantial reduction in nonperforming assets and another sharp
decline in our provision and other credit costs," said Walter V.
Shipley, chairman and chief executive officer.

"We remain firmly on the path to improved operating return
levels, and revenue initiatives and productivity programs under way
throughout the corporation will contribute to ongoing improvements,"
Mr. Shipley said.

Completion of a Brazilian refinancing package during the second
quarter brought to a close the broad rescheduling program begun in
the mid-1980s. Accordingly, Chemical has combined its remaining LDC
reserve for possible loan losses with its general reserve and will
no longer report a separate LDC allowance.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

At June 30, total nonperforming assets were $2,493 million,
down $710 million, or 22 percent, from $3,203 million on March 31
and down $2,370 million, or 49 percent, from June 30 a year ago.

On July 1, Chemical completed its tender offer for all of the
outstanding common stock and the depositary shares representing the
preferred stock of Margaretten Financial Corporation, a leading
mortgage banking company. With this acquisition, Chemical now ranks
fourth nationwide in mortgage originations and fifth in mortgage
servicing. This acquisition is not reflected in second quarter
results.

The corporation's estimated Tier I risk-based capital ratio was
8.4 percent at June 30, compared with 7.6 percent a year ago. At
June 30, the estimated total risk-based capital ratio was 12.4
percent, compared with 12.0 percent a year ago. 

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income for the second quarter was $1,185 million,
compared with $1,175 million in the same year-ago period. The rise
in net interest income is attributable to increases in average
earning assets, partially offset by a decline in average spread.

Average interest-earning assets for the second quarter were
$129.1 billion, compared with $125.6 billion in the same year-ago
period. The composition of average earning assets shifted in
response to growth in liquid assets to support trading businesses
and securities, more than offsetting declines in loans.

The net yield on interest-earning assets was 3.69 percent in
the second quarter, compared with 3.76 percent in the second quarter
of 1993. The shift to lower-spread liquid assets has exerted
downward pressure on the net yield on interest earning assets.

Compared with the first quarter of 1994, net interest income
and the net yield on earning assets improved. Growth in consumer
loans and declines in nonperforming loans contributed to a rise in
the average yield on the loan portfolio.

NONINTEREST REVENUE

Noninterest revenue for the second quarter was $867 million,
compared with $1,042 million in the same period a year ago, which
had included $44 million from the sale of interest due and unpaid
(IDU) bonds, as well as significantly higher trading revenues. 
There were no LDC-related past due interest bond sales in the second
quarter of 1994.

Trust and investment management fees were $108 million in the
second quarter of 1994, compared with $102 million in the year-ago
quarter, reflecting the acquisition of Ameritrust Texas Corporation
in September 1993.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

Corporate finance fees were $93 million in the quarter, up 11
percent from $84 million a year ago.

Fees for other banking services were $279 million in the
quarter, compared with $272 million in the year-ago second quarter. 
This improvement primarily reflected increased revenues generated by
the new co-branded Shell MasterCard

Combined revenues from all trading activities were $203 million
in the second quarter, versus a record $298 million in the same
year-ago period but up from $185 million in the first quarter of
1994. The decline in trading results in the second quarter when
compared with record results in last year's second quarter reflected
difficult conditions in certain markets, including emerging market
debt and European government bonds, as well as in many foreign
exchange markets.

A decline in other noninterest revenue in the second quarter
reflected lower revenues on equity-related investments. The 1994
second quarter result was $66 million, compared with $115 million a
year ago.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense in the second quarter was $1,281 million,
compared with $1,312 million in the same year-ago quarter.

Expenses for the second quarter of 1994 reflected additional
costs of $47 million associated with the acquisition of Ameritrust
and operating costs connected with the Shell MasterCard, including
marketing expenses that increased $21 million, largely reflecting
the advertising campaign for the co-branded program.

Foreclosed property expense was $2 million in the quarter
compared with $85 million in the year-ago period, reflecting
significant progress in managing the corporation's foreclosed real
estate portfolio. The current quarter's expense benefited by
approximately $15 million of gains from the sale of foreclosed
property.

Total headcount at June 30, 1994 was 40,988, compared with
41,303 at June 30, 1993, as staff increases in areas with revenue
growth initiatives were more than offset by reductions from
continued integration and productivity efforts.

<PAGE> 4

PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES

The provision for losses was $160 million in the second
quarter, compared with $205 million in the first quarter of 1994 and
$363 million in the second quarter of 1993.

Non-LDC net charge-offs were $185 million in the second
quarter, compared with $230 million in the first quarter of 1994 and
$363 million in the second quarter a year ago.

Following completion of the Brazilian refinancing package, a
final valuation of the LDC portfolio resulted in a $291 million
charge in the second quarter. The remaining LDC reserve of $300
million, after the final valuation, was transferred to the general
reserve.

At June 30, the allowance for losses was $2,676 million,
compared with $2,991 million on the same date a year ago (including
$570 million related to the LDC allowance).

NONPERFORMING ASSETS

At June 30, total nonperforming assets were $2,493 million,
down $710 million, or 22 percent, from March 31 and down $2,370
million, or 49 percent, from June 30, 1993.

Nonperforming loans at June 30 were $1,758 million, down from
$2,369 million at March 31 and down from $3,764 million at June 30
last year. Assets acquired as loan satisfactions were $735 million
at June 30, down from $834 million at March 31 and down $364 million
from $1,099 million on June 30 a year ago.

The nonperforming amounts include LDCs of $145 million at June
30, down from $524 million at March 31, principally the result of
the completion of the Brazilian refinancing program. New bonds
received in exchange for old debt and approximately $160 million
face value of interest bonds, representing the majority of the
remaining unpaid interest, have been designated as "Available for
Sale."

OTHER FINANCIAL DATA

In the second quarter of 1994, the corporation announced its
intention to repurchase up to 10 million shares of its common stock
on the open market from time to time during the next 12 months. As
of June 30, 1994, the corporation had repurchased approximately 3.2
million shares of its common stock.

The corporation also redeemed all shares of its adjustable rate
Series C Preferred Stock on July 15, 1994 and issued $200 million of
Series L Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock on June 8, 1994.

The corporation's effective tax rate was 41.5 percent in the
second quarter, compared with 29.7 percent in the same period of
1993. Tax expense included an income tax benefit of $54 million in
the second quarter of 1993.

The impact of marking the "Available for Sale" securities to
market resulted in a net unfavorable impact of approximately $291
million after-tax on the corporation's stockholders' equity at June
30, 1994, compared with an unfavorable impact of $192 million after-
tax at March 31, 1994. The market valuation does not include the
favorable impact of related funding sources. 

On January 1, 1994, the corporation adopted FASB Interpretation
No. 39, which changes the reporting of unrealized gains and losses
on interest rate and foreign exchange contracts on the balance
sheet. The adoption of this Interpretation has resulted in an
increase of assets and liabilities of $19.0 billion at June 30,
1994, with unrealized gains reported as Trading Assets-Risk
Management Instruments and the unrealized losses reported in Other
Liabilities.

Total assets at June 30 were $168.9 billion, versus $145.5
billion on the same date a year ago. Total loans at June 30 were
$74.7 billion, compared with $79.2 billion a year ago. At the end
of the second quarter, total deposits were $92.0 billion, compared
with $94.6 billion at June 30, 1993.

The return on average total assets was .87 percent for the
second quarter, compared with 1.04 percent in the same year-ago
period.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

The return on average common stockholders' equity was 13.90
percent for the second quarter, compared with 15.97 percent in the
year-ago second quarter.

Book value per common share was $37.17 at June 30, versus $34.47
per share on the same date a year ago.

TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES

million in the second quarter, versus $44 million a year ago. Its
net yield on interest-earning assets was 4.21 percent in the second
quarter, versus 4.02 percent in the 1993 second quarter. At June
