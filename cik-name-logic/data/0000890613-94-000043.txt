FIRST FINANCIAL CORPORATION NET INCOME UP 29%

Stevens Point, Wisconsin, April 14, 1994... First Financial
Corporation (FFHC-OTC) today reported record first quarter net
income of $12.3 million, or $.49 per share, up 29% from the $9.5
million, or $.40 per share, reported for the first quarter of
1993. Return on average assets (annualized) for the quarter
increased to 1.01%, up from .86% for the first quarter of last
year. Return on average equity (annualized) for the quarter rose
to 19.55%, up from the 19.24% reported at this time last year.

The company attributes its improved financial results to
increasing net interest income, a decreased contribution to
provisions for losses on loans, increasing non-interest income
and cost savings due to the consolidation of operations following
acquisitions in 1993.

"This was a very profitable quarter for our company and we are
well positioned to have another outstanding year in 1994," said
John C. Seramur, president and chief executive officer of First
Financial. 

Net interest income for the quarter rose to $38.9 million, up
from $35.0 million for the first quarter of last year. The
company's net interest margin of 3.30% for the first quarter of
1994 was the same as reported for the first quarter of last year.

Because of the high quality of its loan portfolio, the continued
low loan charge-off experience and certain large recoveries, the
company was able to reduce its contribution to provisions for
losses on loans to $1.4 million, down 51% from the $2.8 million
it set aside for the first quarter of 1993.

Non-interest income increased to $9.7 million, up from $8.7
million for the first quarter of last year. The increase can be
largely attributed to higher levels of insurance and brokerage
sales and increased account service fees.

Non-interest expense as a percentage of total assets continued
its steady decline in the first quarter of 1994. For the
quarter, the ratio was 2.26%, down from 2.31% for the first
quarter of last year. In addition, the company's efficiency
ratio, which compares controllable expenses as a percentage of
recurring income before expenses, decreased to 54.71%, down from
55.37% for the first quarter of 1993.

The company's sensitivity to fluctuating interest rates, or
"gap", stood at a positive 5% at the end of the first quarter of
1994. A positive "gap" normally indicates that a company's
earning assets will reprice faster than its interest bearing
liabilities and that interest income should increase in a rising
interest-rate environment. Management believes that this
positive "gap" position will help the company maintain its
profitability in the current economic climate.

Stockholder's equity increased to $254.2 million, or 5.23% of
total assets, up from $234.7 million, or 4.92% of total assets at
the end of 1993. Book value per share increased to $10.33, up
from $8.62 at this time last year and $9.95 at year-end 1993.

During the first quarter, First Financial completed the
acquisition of NorthLand Bank of Wisconsin, SSB, based in
Ashland, Wisconsin. The acquisition added approximately $125
million in assets and seven new banking offices to First
Financial. The new offices now operate as branches of First
Financial's major subsidiary, First Financial Bank, FSB.

First Financial Corporation operates 124 full service consumer
banking offices in Wisconsin and Illinois and has assets of
approximately $4.9 billion. First Financial has filed with the
Securities Exchange Commission a Form 8-K which includes this
release and other relevant financial information. The
Corporation's shares are traded on the NASDAQ National Market
under the symbol FFHC.

FIRST FINANCIAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Quarter Ended March 31, 1994

(1) On February 26, 1994, the Corporation completed the
acquisition of NorthLand Bank of Wisconsin, SSB
("NorthLand") of Ashland, Wisconsin. The Corporation
issued approximately 938,000 shares of common stock,
valued at $14.2 million, at the time of the acquisition. 
The acquisition of NorthLand has been accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests. NorthLand is not material to the
balance sheet or operating results of the Corporation;
therefore, balances for prior years have not been
restated. However, 1994 amounts were adjusted to reflect
the transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 1994. 
Upon closing, NorthLand was merged into the Corporation's
major subsidiary, First Financial Bank, FSB ("First
Financial"). As of December 31, 1993, NorthLand reported
total assets and stockholders' equity of $127.4 million
and $11.4 million, respectively.

(2) On August 20, 1993, First Financial completed the
assumption of deposits (approximately $268.0 million) and
the purchase of the branch facilities of the four Quincy,
Illinois-area branches of Citizens Federal, a Federal
Savings Bank ("Citizens") of Miami, Florida. The
acquisition of Citizens' four Quincy, Illinois-area
offices was accounted for as a purchase.
