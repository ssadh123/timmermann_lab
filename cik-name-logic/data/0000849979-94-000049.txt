Exhibit 1.

Weirton, WV--September 12, 1994--Weirton Steel Corporation (NYSE:
WS) announced today that a member of its Board of Directors, F.
James Rechin, has resigned effective August 29, 1994. Rechin, 70,
was a charter member of the Board, having been named to the
position during ESOP negotiations in 1983.

"With the completion of the modernization, the equity offering in
place and the internal problems behind us, the Company's prospects
are good," Rechin said. "This is an appropriate time in my life to
resign and pursue other endeavors."

When he joined the Board, Rechin was group Vice President and
General Manager of the Aircraft Components Group of TRW, Inc. 
operations under his direction required the application of high
technology processing to heavy industrial manufacturing and
included forging, casting and metallurgical activities.

He also had specialized in developing and managing significant
programs of employee involvement in work decisions.
