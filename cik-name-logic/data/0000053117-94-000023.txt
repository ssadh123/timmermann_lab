James River to Acquire Rayne Ownership in Jamont

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, April 27, 1994 -- James River Corporation
announced today the signing of an agreement with Montedison S.p.A.
and Rayne Holdings Inc. ("Rayne") providing for the acquisition by
James River of Rayne's 43% indirect interest in Jamont N.V.
("Jamont"). Jamont, with operations in 12 European countries and
1993 sales of approximately $1.4 billion, produces branded and
private label tissue, hygiene, and foodservice products for the
retail and away-from-home-markets. Jamont currently holds the
overall number two position in the European tissue market with a
market share of approximately 15%. Many of Jamont's products hold
the number one market position in their respective countries. 
Under the current ownership structure, James River and Rayne
each hold 50% of Jamont Holdings N.V. ("Holdings"), which owns
86.4% of Jamont. The remaining 13.6% of Jamont is owned by
EuroPaper Inc. The agreement provides that James River will
acquire Rayne's 50% interest in Holdings for approximately $575
million in cash. At the completion of the transaction, James River
will own 86.4% of Jamont, which will then become a consolidated
subsidiary. James River intends to finance this transaction
through the issuance of a combination of debt and equity
securities.
James River and Rayne are parties to a put and call agreement
related to Rayne's interest in Jamont. Pursuant to this agreement,
Rayne has the option to put its interest in Jamont to James River
during the summer of 1996 and the summer of 1998 for a total of
approximately $820 million. In addition, James River has a
currently exercisable option to call Rayne's interest in Jamont, at
a price of approximately $650 million as of the expected closing
date for the announced transaction. This transaction will allow
James River to acquire Rayne's interest in Jamont at a significant
discount to the scheduled put and call prices. The total savings
to James River have a present value of approximately $100 million,
after assumed financing.
"This acquisition fits James River's long-term strategy of
expanding its presence in Europe, where tissue consumption is
generally increasing at a faster rate than in the United States. 
With its well-known premium branded products, strong market shares,
cost-effective manufacturing, advanced technology base, and broad
distribution network, Jamont is strategically positioned to
outperform its competitors in the European market," said Robert C.
Williams, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of James
River. "While Jamont's recent results have been hampered by the
recession in Western Europe, its recently completed capital
expansion and upgrade program and its significant cost reduction
efforts have resulted in positive free cash flow and should provide
the base for improving earnings during the coming years."
The acquisition, which is subject to normal closing
conditions, as well as obtaining necessary financing and approval
of James River's lenders, is expected to be completed during the
third quarter of 1994. 
James River Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia,
is a marketer and manufacturer of consumer products, food and
consumer packaging, and communications papers. These product lines
include leading brands such as Quilted Northern(r) bathroom tissue,
Brawny(r) paper towels, Dixie(r) cups and plates, Eureka!(tm) recycled
copy paper, Quilt-Rap(tm) sandwich wrap, and Qwik Crisp(r) microwave
packaging. For the year which ended on December 26, 1993, James River
had sales of $4.6 billion.

JAMONT HOLDINGS NV

MANAGING DIRECTOR'S REPORT 1993

Background
1993 was a year of sharp contrasts for Jamont. Internally, the
company made excellent progress on all fronts and strengthened
its competitive position substantially. Externally, the business
environment was very poor.

The overall economy is the worst it has been since World War II
and overcapacity has developed in our industry. Increasingly
cost conscious consumers are trading down and retail customers
are engaged in tough market battles, putting unprecedented
pressures back onto manufacturers. As a result of all these
forces, prices have fallen steadily since the second half of
1992, arriving by year end at a level 13% below the mid-'92 mark.

Internal improvements at Jamont have come as a result of our
continued aggressive implementation of the strategy we developed
several years ago. At the core of this strategy is a commitment
toward improving product quality, packaging, advertising, and
service to strengthen all of our principal brands. Substantial
progress was made in 1993 on our tissue brands such as Lotus,
Colhogar, Tenderly and Embo, and also on our Vania feminine
hygiene brand. Improved products, based on advanced tissue
making technology and proprietary converting processes, will
continue to be extended across Europe. At the end of 1993,
Jamont introduced a fully integrated line of Lotus Professional
brand products for away-from-home markets with product
specifications and positioning designed to meet a wide range of
distributor and end-user needs across Europe.

Capital Expenditure
The year was also marked by the completion of our US $600 million
capital investment program begun in 1991. This program included
a number of projects which are enhancing quality, expanding
capacity, and reducing cost throughout the system. All projects
were completed on schedule, on budget, and have come up their
learning curves quickly.

Toward the end of 1992, a new 50,000 ton per year machine and
deinking plant started up at the Hondouville, Normandy mill,
providing a world class site for the manufacture of away-from-
home products. In the Spring of 1993, a new 40,000 ton per year
tissue machine started up, replacing an older machine at the
Castelnuovo mill in Italy. The improved quality and lower costs
provided by this facility are enabling us to make substantial
volume gains and strengthen our Tenderly brand. Despite
interruption related to a warehouse fire at the Allo mill in
Spain last Spring, a new 50,000 ton per year tissue machine was
successfully brought on-line at that site in the Summer, with the
project and ongoing operations functioning at normal levels by
year end. In addition, an expansion of a converting plant at the
Bridgend consumer products mill in the United Kingdom began
operating in late 1993.

These capital projects, along with productivity enhancement
efforts, have enabled us to close converting plants in Biessard,
France; Tottenham, United Kingdom; Calenzano, Italy during the
year, while at the same time expanding total capacity and
increasing sales volume. These closures and other measures have
allowed us to reduce our workforce by approximately 5% or 450
people. These efforts will continue during 1994.

During 1993, new capital appropriations were scaled back
drastically to a level of approximately US $60 million. This
reduction in appropriations is not only in response to the
difficult business environment, but also reflects the completion
of the major capital expansion program during 1993.

Cost Reduction
With strict attention toward reducing costs, Jamont continued an
intense focus on improving manufacturing and distribution
efficiency. Machine speeds and uptime, waste reduction, and
efficient energy usage all improved during the year. Our total
quality initiatives have been of great importance in this regard.
As a result of all these efforts operating margins dropped by
only 1.2% of sales since 1991, despite a decrease of over 10% in
selling prices over the same period.

Jamont's efforts to reduce working capital are of equal
importance. Inventory levels were reduced by 19.6% during 1993,
while unit sales volume increased by 4.4%. Reduced working
capital, combined with the decreased levels of capital spending
toward the end of the major capital expansion program,
contributed to Jamont's generation of positive free cash flow of
US $28 million during the second half of the year. Efforts to
continue reducing working capital and increasing cash flow are a
high priority for 1994.

Financial Results
For the full year, Jamont's financial results reflect the
countervailing forces of 4.4% volume growth and substantial cost
reduction more than offset by falling prices. Net sales of US
$1,346 million in 1993 were 12.8% lower than those in 1992, after
eliminating sales attributable to Kaysersberg Packaging, which
was sold at the end of the first quarter of 1992. However,
decreased net sales were partially offset by the benefits
realised from cost reduction efforts. Operating profits were US
$81.2 million in 1993, compared with US $127.1 million in the
prior year.

Net financial expenses were US $60.7 million in 1993, a decrease
of US $13.8 million compared to 1992 amounts. This decrease was
the result of the focused efforts at reducing outstanding debt
levels, as well as the general reductions in interest rates
experienced throughout Europe in 1993.

Jamont net profit for 1993 was US $29.1 million, a decline of US
$20.9 million compared to profits reported in 1992.

During 1993, Jamont changed its accounting policy relating to
goodwill. Previously, goodwill was recognised as an asset and
amortised over 40 years. Under the new policy, goodwill arising
on acquisition is eliminated against distributable reserves. The
new policy provides for a better understanding of Jamont's
operations, as well as a clearer basis for the evaluation of its
performance. The current goodwill policy also conforms to that
utilised by the majority of publicly traded pan-European
companies, providing for better comparability of Jamont's
financial performance.

Outlook
The outlook for 1994 is similar to 1993, as markets continue to
be very competitive and downward pricing pressures persist. We
believe that significant improvements in profitability depend on
a general European economic recovery and improved industry
conditions which are not expected to occur until 1995 and 1996.
In the meantime, Jamont is continuing its initiatives on volume
growth, quality and service improvements, and cost reduction in
order to offset the effects of the poor business environment. We
remain confident of our long-term strategy and expect to emerge
from this difficult period not only as a much stronger company
but as the clear leader of the consumer paper products industry
in Europe.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Jamont Holdings
N.V.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial
statements of Jamont Holdings N.V. and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1993 and for the year then ended, which are
expressed in United States dollars. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in The Netherlands, which are substantially
the same as auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Jamont Holdings N.V. and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1993 and the consolidated results of their
operations for the year then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in The Netherlands.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles prevailing in The
Netherlands, which differ in certain respects from those
generally accepted in the United States. The approximate effect
of the major differences in the determination of net income and
shareholders' equity is shown in Note 26 to the consolidated
financial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS AT DECEMBER 31, 1993

NOTE 1 - ACTIVITY

The activities of the group relate principally to the manufacture
and sale of hygienic products in the European market. These
products include soft tissue, feminine hygiene, and food service
products.

The company prepares its accounts in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in The Netherlands and in European
Currency Units ("Ecu"), as they better reflect the European
character and activity base of its operations. For purposes of
these financial statements, all amounts have been translated to
US dollars in accordance with accounting policies described in
Note 3 below. (See Note 26 for a reconciliation to United States
generally accepted accounting principles.)

NOTE 2 - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY

The group has implemented a change in accounting policy in
respect of goodwill which was previously recognised as an
intangible asset and amortised over a life of 40 years. Under
the new policy, any goodwill arising on acquisition is eliminated
against distributable reserves as outlined in the Significant
Accounting Policies (Note 3 below).

It is the group's opinion that the new policy enables a better
understanding of the group's operations and provides a clearer
basis for the evaluation of its performance than was previously
possible. The change has been accounted for as an adjustment to
opening shareholders' equity at 1 January 1993. The net book
value of goodwill of US $495 million has been eliminated against
the balance of the share premium account as at that date.

The 1992 financial statements have been restated to allow a true
comparison with the 1993 statements prepared under the new
policy. The impact of the restatement on 1992 reported net
profit and on shareholders' equity at the end of that year is as
follows.

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated accounts include those of the company and
companies in which over 50% of the voting rights are directly or
indirectly owned or which are otherwise controlled by the
company. Companies are excluded from consolidation when control
is intended to be temporary.

A list of directly held consolidated companies is presented
below.

Name Location Domicile Percentage
owned

Jamont NV Amstelveen The Netherlands 86.4%
Unikay Srl (a) Genoa Italy 22.8%

(a) The remaining shares of Unikay SRL are owned by Jamont NV, a
controlled subsidiary of the company.

A full list of all material subsidiaries and associates is
included in Note 25 of this Annual Report.

All material inter-company balances, inter-business transactions,
internal profits, profit distributions, and mutual shareholdings
of the group companies are eliminated.

Goodwill

A change in the accounting policy for goodwill has been
implemented in the year and details relating to this change can
be seen in Note 2 above.

Goodwill represents the excess of cost of acquisition over fair
value of the acquired net assets on the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is eliminated against distributable reserves on
acquisition.

Foreign companies

The balance sheets of foreign companies are translated at the
rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The profit
and loss accounts are translated using average rates of exchange
for the period covered. Translation differences arising from the
above are taken to reserves.

For Ipek Kagit AS, Istanbul, Turkey, which operates in a hyper-
inflationary economy, translation differences are included in net
earnings.

Investments in associated companies

Investments in associated companies, which comprise companies in
which at least 20% of the voting rights are owned, are included
in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method
of accounting. The group's share of net income is included in the
consolidated profit and loss account.

The group's principal associated company is Ipek Kagit AS,
Istanbul, Turkey.

Investments in other companies

Investments in other companies are valued at their acquisition
cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value. Income
from these investments is recognised in the profit and loss
account only upon receipt of dividends.

Foreign currency translation

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. Unsettled
foreign currency transactions are valued at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are
included in the profit and loss account, except in respect of
gains and losses on borrowings used to finance or hedge foreign
equity investments. The net exchange movements on these
borrowings and investments are taken to reserves.

Intangible fixed assets

Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to
write off the cost over expected useful lives which are normally
:

Years

Concessions/Trademarks/Licences 40
Patents/Intellectual Property 20

Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation applied
under purchase method accounting. Financing costs that are
attributable to a construction project and are incurred up to
project completion date are capitalised. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight line method to write off the cost over expected
useful lives which are normally :

Years

Buildings 20-40
Plant and machinery 10-20
Other tangible fixed assets 3-5

Land and construction in progress are not depreciated.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. The cost of goods purchased for resale includes all costs
incurred in bringing the goods to their present location. The
cost of manufactured goods includes raw materials, other direct
production costs, and an appropriate proportion of indirect
production costs. In general, cost is determined on the FIFO
(first-in, first-out) basis, although, depending on the nature of
the business activities, the weighted average price method may be
used. When determining net realisable value, provision is made
for excess, slow moving, old, or obsolete stock.

Receivables

Receivables are stated at net realisable value. When determining
net realisable value, provision is made for doubtful debts.

Other assets and liabilities

Other assets and liabilities are stated at their nominal value
except where indicated otherwise in the related note.

Provisions

Taxation

The financial statements include direct taxes based on the
results of the companies for the financial year calculated
according to local tax rules, including any taxes that may arise
upon dividends being declared.

Deferred tax is provided on the liability method in respect of
timing differences between accounting income and taxable income,
except where the liability is not expected to crystallise in the
foreseeable future. This partial application is used in certain
circumstances except in respect of timing differences which arise
as a result of revaluation adjustments to tangible fixed assets
applied under purchase method accounting.

Pension funding

For funded schemes, the charge for pensions in the year is based
upon the cost of providing pensions on a systematic and rational
basis over the period during which the company benefits from the
employees' services. Any deficits or surpluses arising on
actuarial valuations requiring additional or reduced
contributions are allocated over a period not exceeding the
expected remaining working lives of participating employees.

Other provisions

All other provisions are stated at nominal value.

Net turnover

Net turnover represents the proceeds of goods sold and services
rendered during the year, excluding sales taxes.

Costs and determination of results

Costs are in principle allocated to the financial year in which
the relevant goods or services are supplied.

Results are determined on the basis of the difference between
realisable value of goods supplied, and costs and other expenses
for the year. Results from transactions are accounted for in the
year in which they are realised; losses are accounted for as soon
as they are foreseeable.

Research and development

Research and development costs are expensed in the year in which
they occur.

NOTE 26 - RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO UNITED
STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The consolidated financial statements of Jamont Holdings have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in The Netherlands ("Netherlands GAAP"), which differ
in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The principle differences
are described as follows:

(a) Goodwill

Under Netherlands GAAP, goodwill may be either capitalised
or written off directly to distributable reserves. Under
U.S. GAAP, goodwill (representing the excess of the cost
over the fair value of acquired net assets on the date of
acquisition) must be capitalised and amortised over the
period which it is estimated to benefit. Jamont Holdings'
policy is to eliminate goodwill against distributable
reserves upon acquisition. For U.S. GAAP purposes, such
amounts of goodwill have been restored, and amortisation
related thereto has been recognised.

(b) Deferred income taxes

Under Netherlands GAAP, provision is made for deferred
income taxes under the partial liability method. Under this
method, the tax consequences of timing differences between
accounting and taxable income are recorded as deferred
taxes, except where the related asset or liability is not
expected to be realised in the foreseeable future. Under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," deferred income tax
liabilities and assets are fully recognised for the expected
future tax consequences of all temporary differences and
income tax credits, except where it is more likely than not
that some or all of the tax benefits of future deductions
will not be realised. In these instances, a valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce the amount of the deferred
tax asset.

The application of U.S. GAAP would have had the following
approximate effect on the net income and shareholders' equity of
Jamont Holdings as of December 31, 1993 and for the year then
ended:
US $000
Net profit reported pursuant to
