FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 19, 1994

ZURN INDUSTRIES RECORDS FOURTH QUARTER CHARGE
FOR CLOSING BOILER MANUFACTURING FACILITY 

Erie, PA ... Zurn Industries, Inc. (New York Stock Exchange), a leading

designer, constructor and manufacturer of systems and equipment for power

generation and water control, and Lynx golf equipment, said today that 

management had presented to the Company's Board of Directors at its regularly

scheduled April 18 meeting the plan to discontinue manufacturing at the

Erie, PA Energy Division due to the declining U.S. boiler market and high

labor costs. Closure of the facility will result in the elimination of

approximately 180 manufacturing jobs. The Division will continue to design

and market boilers for the U.S. and an expanding international market. They

will be produced by pre-selected, qualified fabricators.

The Company notified the United Steelworkers in March of its intention to

close the facility by mid-September and a charge in the range of $14 to $16

million, or up to $.80 per share, will be recorded in the fiscal fourth

quarter ended March 31, 1994. Excluding the plant closing charge, earnings

from operations in the fourth quarter were marginally profitable, as had been

anticipated.

Commenting on the closure, Zurn Chairman George H. Schofield said, "Closing

the boiler manufacturing facility in Erie is a very difficult step to take,

but one which became necessary for the Zurn Energy Division to be competitive

and survive. We greatly regret that the Company and the United Steelworkers

were unable to reach an agreement that would sustain manufacturing employment

at the Erie plant at a competitive cost.

"The Zurn Energy Division retains its well-regarded design and engineering 

capability and remains an important part of the power plant engineering and

construction operation which has been the Company's fastest growing business

in recent years. The Division is an engineering leader with a strong

reputation and experience base. We believe that as a result of this action the

Energy Division is better positioned to meet the needs of the many customers

in the markets served."
