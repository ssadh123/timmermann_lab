AT&T AND SUBSIDIARIES AND McCAW AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Note 1 - Historical Presentation 

Previously reported quarterly results for AT&T for 1993 were restated
to reflect the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." In
addition, the provisions for business restructuring have been reclassified
to costs and operating expenses.

Certain amounts reported in McCaw's historical financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the AT&T presentations in the
accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet and Statements of
Income. Such reclassifications are not material to the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements. 

Note 2 - Exchange Ratio

As defined in the Merger Agreement, the Exchange Ratio will be one
AT&T Common Share for each share of McCaw Common Stock; provided, however,
that (i) in the event the Closing Date Market Price of one AT&T Common
Share (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) is less than
$53.00, the Exchange Ratio will be equal to $53.00 divided by the Closing
Date Market Price of one AT&T Common Share, but in no event greater than
1.111 AT&T Common Shares, and (ii) in the event the Closing Date Market
Price of one AT&T Common Share is greater than $71.73, the Exchange Ratio
will be equal to $71.73 divided by the Closing Date Market Price of one
AT&T Common Share, but in no event less than .909 of an AT&T Common Share. 
For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, an
Exchange Ratio of one AT&T Common Share per share of McCaw Common Stock (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) is assumed. 

Note 3 - Other Pro Forma Adjustments

(A) The McCaw Common Stock account has been adjusted to reflect the
assumed exchange of one AT&T Common Share, par value $1.00 per share, for
each of approximately 195.3 million shares of McCaw Common Stock, par value
$.01 per share, outstanding at June 30, 1994 (excluding shares of McCaw
Common Stock held by AT&T - see Note 3(B)). The difference between the par
value of the AT&T Common Shares and the par value of the McCaw Common
Stock, after giving effect to the assumed Exchange Ratio, is reflected as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital of $193.

(B) The $400 investment by AT&T in 14.5 million shares of Class A
Common Stock purchased in February 1993 has been eliminated. The weighted
average common shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 1993
and June 30, 1994 have been adjusted to give affect to the elimination of
this investment.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9
Form 8-K/A#5 AT&T Corp.
August 16, 1993

(C) McCaw's historical financial statements reflect the adoption of
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," retroactive to January 1,
1991. AT&T adopted SFAS No. 109 effective January 1, 1993. For conformity
purposes, the pro forma combined financial statement information for AT&T
and McCaw has been adjusted as if McCaw had adopted SFAS No. 109 on January
1, 1993. Such adoption would result in the use of different tax
assumptions related to intangible assets McCaw acquired in purchase
business combinations in 1991 and 1992 that would increase the cumulative
effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 by $39. Accordingly, the pro forma 
combined net income and earnings per common share have been decreased by
$1,840 and $1.20, respectively, for the period ended June 30, 1993. Pro
forma combined total assets and shareowners' equity have been decreased $39
at June 30, 1994. Also, effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." McCaw adopted
SFAS No. 112 effective January 1, 1994. The impact of this standard on
McCaw's financial statements is immaterial, therefore no adjustment has
been made to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements. 

(D) No adjustments have been reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements for direct expenses related to the Merger. 
Direct expenses included in the historical periods presented have not been
adjusted for in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements as
such amounts are not material. 

(E) No adjustments to eliminate intercompany transactions and balances
have been made in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements as
such amounts are not material. 

(F) The cash dividends per common share in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements reflect AT&T's cash dividends declared in the
periods presented. McCaw has never paid cash dividends on the McCaw Common
Stock.

Note 4 - Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements assume that the
Merger qualifies as a "tax-free" reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.
