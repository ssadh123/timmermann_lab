Item 2. Acquisition of Assets.

On April 8, 1994, Cubic Applications, Inc., a California corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant, a Delaware corporation, acquired all of
the assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with and used by the
Applications division and the Titan Services International division of The Titan
Corporation, a Delaware corporation, for cash in the amount of $21,000,000. The
purchase price, which was determined by auction bid, is subject to an upward or
downward post-closing adjustment based on the net amount of assets less
liabilities as reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet. The purchase price was
paid from surplus cash of the Registrant. There was and is no material
relationship of any kind between Registrant and The Titan Corporation or their
respective associates, directors or officers.

Assets acquired included accounts receivable, contract rights, leases,
leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, books, records, proprietary
rights, computers and software, claims and causes of action, and supplies and
literature used by the Applications and Services International divisions of the
Titan Corporation in the performance of the business conducted by such
divisions. Registrant intends to devote the acquired assets to continuation of
the business of such divisions which involves training, applications and
operations for the United States Army.
