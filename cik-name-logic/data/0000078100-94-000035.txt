ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
On September 28, 1994, PECO Energy Company issued the following press
release:

PECO Energy reported today that it will record a one-time charge against
earnings of approximately $150 million after taxes, or 65 cents per share of
common stock, in the third quarter of 1994, to reflect costs attributable to a
recently completed voluntary retirement/separation program.

PECO Energy estimates that the salaries and benefits saved by the retirements
and separations will amount to approximately $60 million per year by 1996.

2,482 employees accepted either the enhanced retirement or separation package.

PECO Energy said that to ensure an orderly restructuring of the workforce, the
retirements and separations will take place in stages through December 31, 1995.

Both plans were announced in April as part of PECO Energy's continuing cost
reduction efforts.
