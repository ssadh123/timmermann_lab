MATTEL SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 40 PERCENT;
DEMAND FOR TIME-TESTED CORE BRANDS IS STRONG
--------------------------------------------

LOS ANGELES, July 21 -- Mattel, Inc. today reported record second

quarter net income of $57.1 million or $.31 per share, up 40

percent from $40.8 million or $.23 per share in the 1993 quarter.

Net sales were a record $650 million, up 13 percent from $577

million last year.

"This outstanding performance reflects strong worldwide

demand for our core brand products of Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot

Wheels and Disney, fueled by a new toy line tied to the excellent

new animated Disney movie 'The Lion King,'" John W. Amerman,

Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer, said.

"The response to our product lines, combined with advantages

provided by our dedicated global manufacturing network, allowed

us to meet the challenges of difficult worldwide economic

conditions and delays in retail ordering," Amerman said.

For the first half of 1994, net income increased 37 percent

to a record $81.2 million or $.44 per share, versus $59.3 million

or $.33 per share in the first six months of 1993 before

accounting changes. Year-to-date sales were a record $1.138

billion, up 8 percent from $1.054 billion in 1993.

"Our excellent earnings performance in the quarter and first

half reflect significant efficiencies resulting from the

integration of Fisher-Price and Mattel, as well as some benefit

from the acquisition of the assets of Kransco, completed on May

31," Amerman said. "Results for the quarter also include the

contribution of newly-established marketing organizations in

Argentina, Venezuela and Portugal."

Mattel, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design,

manufacture and marketing of children's toys. With headquarters

in El Segundo, California, Mattel has offices and facilities in

34 foreign countries and sells its products in more than 140

nations throughout the world.
