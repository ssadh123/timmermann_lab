ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On November 30, 1994, Charter Medical Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of 10
behavioral healthcare facilities, from National Medical Enterprises, Inc., a
Nevada corporation ("NME"). The Company presently intends to use or operate the
assets acquired from NME for the purposes NME operated such assets. The purchase
price for the assets was approximately $36.8 million in cash, including
approximately $9.5 million related to the net working capital of the facilities.
The amount paid for the net working capital of the facilities acquired is
subject to adjustment. The purchase price for the facilities acquired was
determined by NME following its solicitation of bids for the facilities and
arm's-length negotiations with the Company. NME and the Company are not related
to each other.

The acquisition that occurred on November 30, 1994 was related to the June
30, 1994 acquisition by the Company of certain other facilities from NME, which
acquisition was previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the
Company on July 15, 1994.

Approximately $7.8 million of the purchase price of the facilities acquired
was financed by the Company from the proceeds of the Company's issuance on May
2, 1994, of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 11 1/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2004. Approximately $28.0 million of the purchase price
was financed by the Company from borrowings pursuant to the Second Amended and
Restated Subsidiary Credit Agreement, dated May 2, 1994, among certain
subsidiaries of the Company, Bankers Trust Company, as Agent, First Union
National Bank of North Carolina, as Co-Agent, and the financial institutions
participating therein. The remaining approximately $1.0 million of the purchase
price was provided by cash on hand.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

(a) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired.

Audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1994 for all
facilities acquired from NME, plus two facilities that were not acquired, were
previously filed by the Company in Amendment No. 3 to the Company's Registration
Statement on Form S-4 (No. 33-53701), which was filed on September 16, 1994. The
Company believes that the inclusion of the two facilities that were not acquired
in the audited financial statements will not have a material effect on such
statements. The Company does not believe that it is required to file separate
audited financial statements for the facilities acquired on November 30, 1994
because the November 30 acquisition was related to the June 30 acquisition.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
year ended September 30, 1994, and the nine months ended June 30, 1994, and an
unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 1994,
reflecting the acquisition of all facilities acquired from NME, plus two
facilities that were not acquired, were previously filed by the Company with its
Current Report on Form 8-K/A on September 20, 1994. The Company believes that
the inclusion of the two facilities that were not acquired in the pro forma
financial statements will not have a material effect on such statements. The
Company does not believe that it is required to file separate pro forma
financial statements for the facilities acquired on November 30, 1994 because
the November 30 acquisition was related to the June 30 acquisition.
