HALLIBURTON COMPLETES SALE OF GAS COMPRESSION BUSINESS

DALLAS, Texas -- Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) announced
today that it has completed the sale of its natural gas
compression business unit to Tidewater Compression Service, Inc.
for $205 million cash. The sale will result in Halliburton
recording a pretax gain of $102 million, or 56 cents per share
after tax, to its 1994 fourth quarter earnings. The proceeds of
the sale will be used for general corporate purposes.

The business unit sold owns and operates a large natural gas
compressor rental fleet in the United States and Canada. The
compressors are used to assist in the production, transportation
and storage of natural gas.

Thomas H. Cruikshank, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer of Halliburton Company, said, "Halliburton
continues to focus resources on the core business activities
within its Halliburton Energy Services business segment. The
sale of the natural gas compression business unit is consistent
with our objective to divest businesses that are peripheral to
core business activities."
