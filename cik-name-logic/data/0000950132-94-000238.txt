FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

MELLON REPORTS SHARPLY HIGHER THIRD QUARTER 1994 EARNINGS

o Earnings Per Share Increases 22 Percent to $1.53 Per Share 
in Third Quarter 1994 on a Pre-Split Basis Excluding 
Dreyfus-Related Charges

o Return on Common Equity Reaches 16.1 Percent for Quarter, 
Return on Assets Reaches 1.74 Percent Excluding 
Dreyfus-Related Charges

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 18, 1994 -- Mellon Bank Corporation (NYSE:MEL) 
today reported third quarter 1994 net income of $167 million, or $1.53 
per common share, on a pre-split basis, excluding $79 million in 
after-tax merger expenses related to Mellon's August 1994 merger with 
The Dreyfus Corporation and $10 million in after-tax, one-time losses 
on the disposition of investment securities previously owned by 
Dreyfus. As a result of the Dreyfus transaction, all prior periods 
have been restated to reflect the pooling-of-interests method of 
accounting for the merger. The Corporation's third quarter 1994 
results compare with net income of $139 million, or $1.25 per common 
share, in the third quarter of 1993.

Including Dreyfus-related charges, third quarter 1994 net income was 
$78 million, or $.64 per common share, on a pre-split basis. On a 
post-split basis, reflecting the Corporation's recently announced 

<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
Oct. 18, 1994
Page 2

three-for-two common stock split, effective Nov. 15, 1994, third quarter 1994 
net income was $.42 per common share, compared with $.83 per common share in 
the third quarter of 1993.

"Our strong third quarter earnings were driven by net interest revenue growth 
and substantially reduced credit quality expense," said Mellon Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer Frank V. Cahouet. "Because of our solid 
earnings and capital position, we were pleased to announce a 21 percent 
increase in the Corporation's common dividend and a three-for-two common stock 
split last month."

Net interest revenue was $376 million, up 10 percent from $343 million in the 
prior-year period, primarily reflecting a higher yielding asset mix. Fee 
revenue was $399 million in the third quarter of 1994, compared with $419 
million in the third quarter of 1993. The decrease in fee revenue, offset 
partially by business growth, reflects the impact of divestitures and lower 
mutual fund management and administration revenues.

Operating expense for the third quarter of 1994 was $595 million, compared 
with $520 million in the prior-year period. The increase primarily reflects 
$104 million of merger expenses associated with the Corporation's Dreyfus 
transaction, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in acquired property 
expense reflecting gains on the sale of acquired assets.

The provision for credit losses was $15 million in the third quarter of 1994, 
compared with $30 million in the prior-year period. Net credit losses were 
$16 million, down significantly from $28 million in the third quarter of 
1993. Nonperforming assets totaled $260 million at Sept. 30, 1994, down 
slightly from $264 million at June 30, 1994. Nonperforming assets decreased 
by $134 million, or 34 percent, from $394 million at Sept. 30, 1993.

Annualized return on common shareholders' equity and return on assets, 
excluding Dreyfus-related charges, were 16.1 percent and 1.74 percent, 
respectively, in the third quarter of 1994. Annualized return on common 
shareholders' equity and return on assets, including Dreyfus-related charges, 
were 6.76 percent and .81 percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 1994, 
compared with 14.34 percent and 1.47 percent, in the third quarter of 1993.

With balance sheet assets of approximately $39 billion and assets under 
management and administration of more than $850 billion, Mellon Bank 
Corporation is a major financial services company headquartered in Pittsburgh, 
providing a full range of banking and investment products and services to 
individuals and small, mid-sized and large businesses and institutions.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
- ------------------------

Merger with The Dreyfus Corporation
- -----------------------------------

On August 24, 1994, the Corporation merged with The Dreyfus Corporation
(Dreyfus), creating the largest combination of a banking institution and a
mutual fund company in the history of the financial services industry. As a
result of the merger, the Corporation is the nation's second largest investment
management firm, with assets under management totaling approximately $200
billion and is by far the largest bank manager of mutual funds. The Corporation
expects annual revenues to be approximately $3.1 billion, of which more than
half will come from fee revenue.

The transaction was accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method, with
prior period financial results restated to reflect the merger. Dreyfus
shareholders received 0.88017 shares of the Corporation's common stock for each
of the 36.7 million Dreyfus shares outstanding resulting in 32.2 million shares
of the Corporation's common stock being issued. Following this merger, the
Corporation's return on assets, excluding Dreyfus merger-related charges,
improved 27 basis points to 1.74 percent. In addition, the Corporation's common
shareholders' equity to assets ratio improved 166 basis points compared with the
pre-merger prior quarter-end ratio. However, as a result of the issuance of the
additional shares, earnings per common share for the Corporation's prior four
quarters, on a restated basis, were approximately 17% to 19% lower than
previously reported amounts.

In connection with the merger, the Corporation recorded one-time merger expenses
in the third quarter of 1994 of $104 million, or $79 million after-tax. The
Corporation also incurred losses of $15 million, or $10

<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
Oct. 18, 1994
Page 5

million after-tax, on the disposition of securities classified as available for
sale that were held by Dreyfus. These securities did not meet the investment
objectives, interest rate or credit risk characteristics required by the
Corporation. The $10 million after-tax losses on the disposition of these
securities did not impact shareholders' equity because Dreyfus had previously
recorded a fair value adjustment to equity to reflect the unrealized losses on
these securities in accordance with FAS No. 115. The merger expenses primarily
consisted of: estimated required payouts due under pre-existing employee benefit
programs and severance programs; the write-down of certain facilities and
assets; professional fees, proxy solicitation and other expenses.

</TABLE>

The 10% improvement in net interest revenue and the net interest margin in the
third quarter of 1994, compared with the third quarter of 1993, primarily
resulted from a higher yielding asset mix as lower-margin money market assets
were replaced with higher-margin loans and securities. Average loans increased
$1.9 billion and average securities increased $700 million, replacing $2.7
billion of money market assets. The increase in average loans included $1.3
billion related to the December 1993 acquisition of AFCO Credit Corporation,
a $600 million increase in retail lending and a $475 million increase in credit
card loans. The increase in average credit card loans in the third quarter of
1994, compared with the prior-year period, was primarily driven by the
CornerStone credit card product introduced during the first quarter of 1994. 
At September 30, 1994, this product had generated 627,000 new accounts with
total

<PAGE>

outstandings of $500 million. A further reduction in nonperforming assets, a
lower level of long-term debt and higher loan fees also contributed to the
improved net interest revenue and net interest margin compared with the
prior-year period.

The improvement in net interest revenue in the first nine months of 1994
resulted principally from the same factors responsible for the third quarter
increase, as well as a higher level of average interest-earning assets resulting
from the second quarter 1993 acquisition of The Boston Company.

Average loans increased $830 million in the third quarter of 1994, compared with
the second quarter of 1994, a 14% annualized increase. The increase primarily
resulted from a $270 million increase in credit card loans, a $200 million
increase in retail lending and a $180 million increase in domestic wholesale
loans.

Credit quality expense, defined as the provision for credit losses plus the net
expense of acquired property, was $41 million lower in the third quarter of
1994, compared with the prior-year period, reflecting the

<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
Oct. 18, 1994
Page 7

improved credit quality of the loan portfolio and the lower level of real estate
acquired (OREO). The $12 million in net revenue from acquired property in the
third quarter of 1994 resulted from $12 million in net gains on the sale of
acquired property, as well as no provision to the reserve for OREO. Net expense
of acquired property in the third quarter of 1993 resulted from a $14 million
provision to the reserve for OREO. Net credit losses decreased $12 million
compared with the third quarter of 1993 reflecting decreases in all major loan
categories. Domestic net credit losses in the third quarter of 1994 included $4
million on loans from the September 1994 Glendale Bancorporation (Glendale)
acquisition.

Credit quality expense was $120 million lower in the first nine months of 1994,
compared with the first nine months of 1993. Improved credit quality led to a
$45 million decrease in the provision for credit losses. The net expense of
acquired property decreased $75 million as the first nine months of 1994
included $24 million in net gains on the sale of acquired property and no
provision to the reserve for OREO, compared with the first nine months of 1993
that included a $44 million OREO reserve provision. Net credit losses in the
first nine months of 1994 were down by $70 million compared with the first nine
months of 1993, primarily resulting from lower commercial real estate net credit
losses.

The $20 million decrease in trust and investment management fees in the third
quarter of 1994, compared with the prior-year period, resulted from several
factors. Mutual fund administration fees decreased $14 million and included a
$7 million decrease in revenue related to the second quarter 1994 sale of the
Boston-based third-party mutual fund administration business. In addition,
revenue from the management of Dreyfus mutual fund assets decreased $7 million
while securities lending revenue decreased $5 million. The lower revenue from
the management of mutual funds resulted from a lower average level of mutual
fund assets managed at Dreyfus. Average funds managed at Dreyfus in the third
quarter of 1994 were $69 billion compared with $80 billion in the third quarter
of 1993. This decrease resulted from a $7 billion reduction in average
institutional money market assets managed as well as an overall drop in the
market values of assets managed paralleling the decline in the bond markets over
the past 12 months. At September 30, 1994, compared to September 30, 1993, the
Lehman Brothers Long Term Government Bond Index decreased 11%. The decrease in
securities lending revenue primarily resulted from narrowing margins in a period
of rapidly rising short-term interest rates. Partially offsetting these
decreases was higher revenue from growth in other trust and investment products.

Fee revenue for Dreyfus was $76 million and $245 million in the third quarter
and first nine months of 1994, compared with $85 million and $262 million in the
third quarter and first nine months of 1993.

Information services fees decreased $20 million, compared with the prior-year
period, primarily as a result of the Corporation's December 1993 sale of two
information services businesses that generated quarterly revenues of

<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
Oct. 18, 1994
Page 9

approximately $21 million. The $6 million increase in mortgage servicing fees,
compared with the prior-year period, resulted from acquisitions of mortgage
servicing rights coupled with a lower rate of prepayments. On August 11, 1994,
the Corporation acquired $3.6 billion of mortgage servicing rights from U.S.
Bancorp Mortgage Company which generated $1 million in fees in the third quarter
of 1994. The Corporation expects the mortgage servicing rights acquired from
U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Company to generate mortgage servicing revenue of
approximately $3 million per quarter.

The $4 million increase in credit card revenue in the third quarter of 1994,
compared with the third quarter of 1993, primarily resulted from revenue
generated by the Corporation's CornerStone credit card product.

The increase in foreign currency and securities trading fee revenue in the third
quarter of 1994 was primarily attributable to foreign exchange fees earned,
primarily as a result of increased global custody and corporate customer
activity.

The $15 million in pretax losses on securities available for sale in the third
quarter of 1994 related to the disposition of securities held by Dreyfus that
did not meet the investment objectives, interest rate or credit risk
characteristics required by the Corporation.

Fee revenue in the first nine months of 1994 was up $138 million, or 12%, from
the first nine months of 1993, primarily as a result of a nine month impact of
The Boston Company in 1994, compared with a partial impact in 1993.

<PAGE>

Page 10

The Corporation recorded $5 million in losses and $90 million in gains on the
sale of securities during the first nine months of 1994 and 1993, respectively,
resulting from the sale of securities from the available for sale portfolio.
Sales undertaken as part of the financing plan and balance sheet restructuring
relating to the acquisition of The Boston Company resulted in gains of $87
million in the first nine months of 1993.

Operating expense before the net expense (revenue) of acquired property and
merger expenses decreased by $3 million in the third quarter of 1994, compared
with the third quarter of 1993. This decrease was the result of the sale of the
information services businesses in December 1993 and the third-party mutual fund
administration business in the second quarter of 1994. The decrease in expenses
resulting from the sale of these businesses

<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings

Page 11

more than offset modest expense growth, as well as an increase in expenses
related to the December 1993 AFCO acquisition and other smaller acquisitions
that have occurred in 1994. On a stand-alone basis, Dreyfus' operating expense
before merger expenses increased to $62 million in the third quarter of 1994,
compared with $57 million in the prior-year period primarily due to higher
marketing expenses.

Operating expense before the net expense of acquired property and merger
expenses totaled $1,552 million in the first nine months of 1994, compared with
$1,323 million in the first nine months of 1993. The increase was primarily the
result of a nine month impact of The Boston Company in 1994, compared with a
partial impact in 1993, as well as an increase in marketing expense of $27
million, recorded in the first nine months of 1994, primarily related to the
introduction of the Corporation's CornerStone credit card product. Dreyfus
incurred operating expenses before merger expenses of $174 million and $163
million in the first nine months of 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Except for the merger with Dreyfus, which was accounted for under the pooling-
of-interests method, the Corporation has historically accounted for business
combinations under the purchase method of accounting, resulting in the recording
of goodwill and other identified intangibles which are amortized in future years
into operating expense. These intangibles primarily include goodwill from The
Boston Company and Meritor acquisitions as well as core deposit intangibles and
covenants not to compete. Excluding the Dreyfus merger-related charges, net
income, excluding the after-tax impact of the amortization expense of
intangibles recorded in purchase acquisitions of $16 million and $56 million for
the third quarter

<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
Oct. 18, 1994
Page 12

and first nine months of 1994, would have been $183 million and $537 million,
respectively.

Merger expenses of $104 million, or $79 million after-tax, were recorded in the
third quarter of 1994 to reflect expenses associated with the Dreyfus merger.
Merger expenses of $175 million, or $112 million after-tax, were recorded in the
first quarter of 1993 for expenses associated with the acquisition of The Boston
Company.

Income Taxes
- ------------
The provision for income taxes totaled $269 million in the first nine months of
1994, compared with $213 million in the first nine months of 1993. Excluding
the impact of the Dreyfus merger-related expenses and losses on the disposition
of securities in the third quarter of 1994, the Corporation's effective tax rate
for the first nine months was 38.25%. Excluding the impact of The Boston
Company merger-related expenses, securities gains and a one-time tax benefit of
$5 million resulting from a 1993 change in tax legislation, the Corporation's
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 1993 was 39%. The Corporation's
effective tax rate for the third quarter of 1994 was 38% and it is currently
anticipated that the effective tax rate will remain at approximately 38% for the
foreseeable future.

Nonperforming assets totaled $260 million at September 30, 1994, down slightly
from $264 million at June 30, 1994 despite the addition of $12 million of
nonperforming assets from the September 1994 acquisition of Glendale. Domestic
nonperforming real estate assets, which include nonperforming commercial and
consumer real estate loans and OREO net of the reserve, decreased by $18 million
during the quarter primarily as a result of loans returning to accrual status,
sales and repayments. The increase in other domestic nonperforming loans
resulted from the addition of a loan to a consumer finance company and $9
million of commercial and industrial loans from Glendale. The decrease in
international nonperforming loans resulted from repayments.

Nonperforming assets decreased by $134 million, or 34%, compared with September
30, 1993, primarily due to the $141 million reduction in domestic nonperforming
real estate assets. The reduction resulted primarily from returns to accrual
status, asset sales and repayments.

(c) The book value per common share assumes full conversion of the Series D
preferred stock to common stock. Accordingly, this includes the additional
paid-in capital on the Series D preferred stock because this paid-in
capital had no liquidation preference over the common stock. The Series D
preferred stock was converted to common stock in August 1994.
(d) Restated to reflect a three-for-two common stock split declared September
20, 1994, payable November 15, 1994.

On September 20, 1994, the board of directors of the Corporation approved a
three-for-two split of the Corporation's common stock to be distributed on
November 15, 1994, to shareholders of record on November 1, 1994. Also, on
September 20, 1994, the board of directors approved a 21% increase in the

common stock dividend to $.675 per share on a pre-split basis. The increased
dividend is payable on November 15, 1994. On a post-split basis, the
Corporation's quarterly dividend will be $.45 per share.

The decrease in the Corporation's common and total shareholders' equity in the
third quarter of 1994, compared with June 30, 1994, primarily resulted from the
declaration of two common stock dividends in the third quarter of 1994. The
Corporation typically declares one common dividend per quarter, but an
additional common dividend of $66 million was declared in the third quarter when
the dividend increase and common stock split were announced. As a result of the
additional common dividend declaration in the third quarter that is payable
November 15, 1994, it is anticipated that no common dividend will be declared in
the fourth quarter.

The declaration of the additional common dividend in the third quarter of 1994
resulted in a 17 basis point reduction in the common shareholders' equity to
assets ratio, with the remaining reduction resulting from a higher level of
assets.
