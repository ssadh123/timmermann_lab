CHASE MANHATTAN BANK TO ACQUIRE
AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL HOLDING CORPORATION

The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. and American Residential
Holding Corporation (AMRS, NASDAQ) today jointly announced the
signing of a definitive merger agreement, whereby a subsidiary of
Chase will seek to acquire through a tender offer all of the
outstanding common stock of AMRS, for a total of approximately $348
million. AMRS is the parent company of American Residential
Mortgage Corporation, one of the nation's leading residential
mortgage lenders. Headquartered in La Jolla, California, AMRS
operates approximately 100 branches in 32 states and originates and
services single-family and multi-family residential mortgages. 
AMRS ranked tenth in origination of single-family residential
mortgages for the first half of 1994 and serviced a loan portfolio
of approximately $15.4 billion at June 30, 1994.

The combination of Chase and AMRS would rank in the top
five nationwide in mortgage originations with a volume of
approximately $11.5 billion, based on figures for the first half of
1994, and would rank fifth in mortgage servicing, with a combined
servicing volume of $62.1 billion as of June 30, 1994.

Fred Koons, chairman of Chase Manhattan Mortgage Holdings,
Chase's mortgage banking subsidiary, said, "As a leading provider
of mortgages, Chase offers flexible financing opportunities to meet
the diverse home buying needs of our customers. The acquisition of
American Residential, a top quality retail and wholesale mortgage
originator will strengthen Chase's presence in both channels. 
Chase will gain geographic diversity from entrance into 25 new
locations. This acquisition will also significantly increase
conforming loan volume for Chase complementing our leading position
in jumbo loans."

This acquisition is part of Chase's ongoing strategy to grow
and expand in the mortgage business and follows Chase's purchase in
July, 1993, of Troy & Nichols, a mortgage origination and servicing
company based in Monroe, LA.

"The combination of American Residential with Chase's other
mortgage origination entities will position us toward our goal of
becoming a top three mortgage lender by 1997," Koons continued.

John M. Robbins, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of
American Residential Holding Corporation, said, "The major strategy
of American Residential has been to maximize shareholder returns by
building a cost effective, customer driven origination system and
a high quality residential loan servicing portfolio. Our board
believes the purchase price fairly values the company's past
performance and recognized position as a leader in our industry."

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by
the boards or directors of both companies, Chase's newly formed
subsidiary, Chamres, Inc., will begin a cash tender offer no later
than August 9, 1994, for all outstanding shares of AMRS's common
stock at $28.25 per share, net to seller in cash. The tender offer
will be subject to, among other things, certain regulatory
approvals and the valid tender of not less than 80% of AMRS's
outstanding common stock.

Following completion of the tender offer and receipt of any
necessary stockholders' approval, shares of AMRS common stock not
acquired in the tender offer will be acquired through a merger at
the same price.
