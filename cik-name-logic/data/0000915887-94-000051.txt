Item 5. Other Events

On September 20, 1994, a federal district court jury in the
employment litigation brought by Robert M. Haft, the former president of
Dart Group Corporation (the "Corporation") (Robert M. Haft v. Dart Group
Corporation, et al. (D. Del. Civ. Action No. 93-384-SLR)), found that the
Corporation had breached its employment contract with Robert M. Haft and
awarded him damages against the Corporation (equivalent to the compensation
projected to be due under the remaining term of the employment contract) in
the amount of $18,856,964. The jury also found that the Corporation's
majority-owned subsidiary, Crown Books Corporation, had breached an
employment agreement with Robert Haft and awarded him damages (equivalent to
the compensation projected to be due under that employment contract) against
Crown Books in the amount of $12,800,910. The jury also found that Robert
Haft did not voluntarily terminate his employment within the meaning of his
Incentive Stock Agreement with Crown Books, and therefore Crown Books does
not have the right to repurchase 100,000 shares of incentive stock at their
original issue price. Robert Haft is expected to ask the judge presiding
over the case to award him additional damages in the amount of approximately
$2.4 million based on the failure of Crown Books to deliver 100,000
unrestricted shares of Crown Books stock to him when he demanded them in
August of 1993.

The Corporation and Crown Books are considering their
options, including seeking to overturn the verdict in the District Court and
taking an appeal.
