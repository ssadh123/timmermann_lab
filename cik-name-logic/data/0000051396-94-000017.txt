release is as follows:

MALLINCKRODT GROUP SAYS MEDICAL COMPANY PLANS TO RELOCATE A
MANUFACTURING OPERATION

St. Louis, Missouri, September 7, 1994 -- Mallinckrodt
Group
Inc. (NYSE:MKG) announced today that its medical business,
Mallinckrodt Medical, Inc., plans to move its tracheal tube
manufacturing operations from Argyle, N.Y., to three other
locations.

C. Ray Holman, Mallinckrodt Group president and chief
executive officer, said, "This relocation program is one
piece
of a previously announced restructuring that Mallinckrodt
Medical initiated and recorded in fiscal 1994. Other
components of the restructuring include a reorganization of
the
company's sales structure, which has been completed, and
the
reduction, centralization and standardization of certain
non-
sales related functions and management systems to better
support the reorganized sales structure. The restructuring
program will enable Mallinckrodt Medical to maintain strong
sales and earnings growth."

The medical company's plans call for 12 to 13 percent
sales growth over the next five years and earnings growth
of
approximately 14 to 15 percent. The growth will result
from
the introduction of new products, such as OctreoScan and
Albunex, which were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in June and August, respectively; volume
growth
from existing products; productivity improvement and cost
reductions from the restructuring.

Mallinckrodt Group Inc., a St. Louis-based Fortune 250
company, had fiscal 1994 net sales of $1.94 billion. 
Through
its three technology-based businesses -- Mallinckrodt
Chemical
and Mallinckrodt Medical, both headquartered in the St.
Louis
area, and Mallinckrodt Veterinary, headquartered in
Mundelein,
Illinois, the company provides human and animal health
products
and specialty chemicals.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of
1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be
signed
on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Mallinckrodt Group Inc.

ROGER A. KELLER
Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
