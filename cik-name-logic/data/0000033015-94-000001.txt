ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

Set forth below in its entirety is a news release issued by ENSERCH
Corporation on December 22, 1993. This release relates to ENSERCH Corporation's
closing of the sale of the principal operating assets of Ebasco Services
Incorporated to Raytheon Engineers & Constructors and the sale of Dorsch 
Consult.

ENSERCH CLOSES EBASCO SALE;
SELLS 49% INTEREST IN DORSCH CONSULT

DALLAS, TEXAS (December 22, 1993) -- ENSERCH Corporation has
closed the sale of the principal operating assets of the
Corporation's engineering and construction subsidiary, Ebasco
Services, to Raytheon Engineers & Constructors. In a separate
transaction, ENSERCH also has completed the sale of its 49% interest
in Dorsch Consult in Germany for $9.5 million, including debt
assumption.

ENSERCH is retaining the bulk of Ebasco's accounts receivable. 
ENSERCH also is retaining and will operate Ebasco's environmental
division, which will be known as Enserch Environmental.

"We are pleased with the proceeds from the sale of Ebasco
under this agreement," said David W. Biegler, ENSERCH chairman,
president and chief executive officer. "A sale price of
$210 million, accounts receivable with a net book value of
$135 million, and a retained business with a value well above its
net book value of $29 million add to a value from this sale in the
upper range of most financial analysts' expectations."

"Completing these two transactions," Biegler added, "is a
major step forward permitting ENSERCH to focus on its integrated
natural-gas business. Proceeds from the closings and the collection
of receivables provide a significant cash infusion that is being
directed toward our goal of a strengthened balance sheet."

PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

The Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet has been prepared to
reflect the effects of the following transactions as if such transactions had

(1) The sale, effective December 22, 1993, by ENSERCH of the

("Ebasco"), for some $210 million. Accounts receivable
of Ebasco with a net book value of $135 million and

(2) The sale, effective December 17, 1993, of the Corpora-
tion's 49% interest in German-based Dorsch Consult for
$9.3 million, including debt assumed.

The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended
September 30, 1993, and for the year ended December 31, 1992, have been restated
to reflect the sold engineering and construction operations, including the UK-
based H&G Engineering business sold in 1992, as discontinued operations.

ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Periods Ended September 30, 1993 and December 31, 1992
(Unaudited)

Statements of Income Adjustments

(a) To reclassify discontinued engineering and construction opera-
tions. The after-tax gain of approximately $83 million, which is
net of provisions for impairment of retained assets and for
liabilities related to the sold businesses, has not been 
reflected in the statements of income restated for discontinued
operations. Partially offsetting this gain, in the fourth
quarter, the Corporation expects to record provisions for 
impairment of some of its oil and gas properties and for other
matters.

Balance Sheet Adjustments

(b) Adjustment to reflect the sale of the principal operating assets
of Ebasco and the sale of the Corporation's 49% interest in
Dorsch. Cash proceeds of $210 million and $9.3 million
from the respective sales have been used to retire $200 million 
of long-term debt and $19.3 million of commercial paper 
indebtedness.
