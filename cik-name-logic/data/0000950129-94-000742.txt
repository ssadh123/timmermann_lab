ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

Effective as of the close of business on October 7, 1994, First
National Financial Corporation (FNFC) of Vicksburg, Mississippi, parent company
of First National Bank of Vicksburg, Mississippi merged with Trustmark
Corporation (Trustmark), parent company of Trustmark National Bank in a
business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests. The stockholders
of FNFC received 3,600,262 shares of Trustmark stock and $1.1 million in cash
in connection with the merger. The financial terms of the merger agreement
were arrived at through arms-length negotiations between representatives of
each organization. The parties to the merger agreement considered banking
stock data with respect to certain other business combinations in the banking
industry, the multiple over FNFC's earnings, the premium offered to the FNFC
shareholders over book value and historic trading prices of FNFC common stock,
and the tax consequences of the holding company merger and bank consolidation.
Trustmark retained the banking consultants of Alex Sheshunoff & Co.
(Sheshunoff) to issue an opinion as to the fairness of the consideration
offered to FNFC. It was Sheshunoff's opinion that the consideration offered by
Trustmark was fair.

At September 30, 1994, FNFC had total consolidated assets of
approximately $278 million and total consolidated deposits of approximately
$243 million. There were no material relationships between the registrant and
the seller.

All property, plant and equipment acquired was used by FNFC solely for
banking purposes. Trustmark will also use these assets solely for banking
purposes. Plans are for all locations to remain open in the foreseeable
future.

ITEM 7A. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED

The consolidated, audited fiscal year-end Financial Statements of FNFC
and Subsidiary and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
required by Item 7A of Form 8-K are contained in FNFC's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993, as previously filed with the
Commission and therefore, are incorporated herein by reference.

The consolidated Balance Sheet and Statements of Income of FNFC and
Subsidiary as of September 30, 1994 and for the nine months ended September 30,
1994 and 1993 follows:
