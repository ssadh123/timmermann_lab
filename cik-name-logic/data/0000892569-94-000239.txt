ADDENDUM TO PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This Addendum to Purchase Agreement (the "Addendum") is entered
into effective as of September 17, 1993, by and between Roger Nix, an
individual (the "Seller"), Capital Pacific Homes, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
together with any assignee thereof pursuant to Section 5.4 below ("Purchaser"),
and Durable Homes, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), as an addendum
to that certain Purchase Agreement among Seller, Purchaser and the Company of
even date herewith (the "Purchase Agreement").

The following paragraph is hereby added as a first paragraph at
the beginning of Section 4.12 of the Purchase Agreement:

"For a period of five (5) years after the Closing, Capital
Pacific Homes, Inc. (even if Capital Pacific Homes, Inc. has
otherwise assigned all of its rights under the Purchase
Agreement to Peters or any other person or entity) shall have
the right and option to purchase from Seller and his
transferees, heirs, successors and assigns (except any of the
Peters Shares sold to the public pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933) such portion of the
Peters Shares as will bring the number of Shares of Peters
Stock owned by Capital Pacific Homes, Inc. to 80.05% of the
total number of shares of Peters stock outstanding from time to
time, by giving Seller written notice of such election to
purchase (a "Purchase Notice") at any time and from time to
time. The rights of Capital Pacific Homes, Inc. pursuant to
this Section may be exercised at one time or in two or more
separate purchases of portions of the Peters Shares; in
addition, such election(s) may be exercised as to the Peters
Shares owned by some, but not all, of the holders of the Peters
Shares from time to time. In the event of the repurchase of
Peters Shares pursuant to this Section, the purchase price
shall be the greater of (i) the closing price for shares of
Peters stock for the business day immediately preceding the
date of the Purchase Notice (adjusted for any stock splits,
reverse splits or other changes in the number of publicly
traded shares of Peters stock taking effect after the date of
the Closing) as set forth in the Wall Street Journal, or (ii)
$3.41 per share, escalated at the rate of 10% per annum from
the date of the Closing through the date of the Purchase Notice
(the "Repurchase Price"). The Repurchase Price shall be paid
in cash upon delivery of the Peters Shares to be repurchased,
endorsed for transfer or accompanied by stock powers executed
in blank, with the closing to take place on a date specified by
Capital Pacific Homes, Inc. not more than thirty (30) days
subsequent to the Purchase Notice. The parties acknowledge
that the Repurchase Price may vary from time to time, based on
the date of the Purchase Notice for each particular block of
Peters Shares to be repurchased pursuant to this Section."

Closing for the Purchase Price (or 100% of the assets of the Company in the
event Purchaser elects to structure the transaction as an asset purchase). In
the event Peters issues additional stock or other equity interest prior to or
concurrently with the Closing, or repurchases or otherwise retires any
outstanding shares prior to the Closing, as the case may be, the number of
Peters Shares to be delivered to Seller upon the Closing shall be increased or
decreased proportionately so that the number of shares transferred to Seller
equals 6.92233% of the total outstanding shares of common stock of Peters as of
the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement
is assigned by Purchaser to Peters such that the Peters Shares are shares being
issued directly by Peters to Seller at the Closing, the total number of Peters
Shares delivered to Seller upon the Closing shall be the lesser of 1,015,000
shares or 6.76667% of the total outstanding shares of the common stock of
Peters upon the Closing. In the event this Agreement is assigned to Peters
after Purchaser has delivered into the Escrow the 967,742 shares of Peters
stock owned by Capital Pacific Homes, Inc., the stock certificate(s) and other
documents evidencing such shares that are held in the Escrow shall be returned
to Capital Pacific Homes, Inc. upon delivery by Peters into Escrow one or more
stock certificates representing the replacement Peters Shares, as calculated
pursuant to this Section.

4.4 Restricted Durable Shares; Registration
Rights. In the event that, after the Closing, Peters shall in its sole
discretion determine to effect any registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, with respect to the offer of any of its securities by it or
others pursuant to a registration statement (other than a registration relating
solely to the sale of securities to participants in a Peters stock plan or a
registration in any form which does not include substantially the same
information as would be required to be included in a registration statement
covering the sale of the Peters Shares), and Purchaser is contractually
entitled to register any shares of Peters stock owned by Purchaser in
connection with such offering, Purchaser shall provide Seller with prompt
notice thereof. In the event that, within fifteen (15) days of such notice,
Seller elects by written notice to Purchaser to pursue registration of the
Peters Shares then owned by Seller, Purchaser shall assign to Seller any rights
Purchaser may then have, or otherwise obtain for Seller the right, to include
Seller's Peters Shares in such registration on a pro rata basis with the number
of Purchaser's shares that Purchaser is entitled to register (i.e., the same
proportion that the number of the Peters Shares owned by Seller bears to the
total number of shares of Peters stock owned by Purchaser), provided that (i)
Seller shall bear the entire

10
<PAGE> 14
expense allocable to the registration of its shares, including, but not limited
to, all underwriters' discounts and commissions properly allocable to Peters
Shares (expenses not more appropriately allocated by another means shall be
allocated proportionately based upon the number of shares being registered by
Seller as a percentage of the total number of shares of Peters stock being
registered), (ii) in no event shall Peters be obligated to qualify to do
business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to be so
qualified or to take any action which would subject it to tax or the service of
process in any state where it would not otherwise be subject thereto; (iii)
such registration or qualification shall not be required to be effective for a
period in excess of ninety (90) days after the first distribution of shares
described in the registration statement relating thereto; (iv) in the event
that Peters' offering is underwritten, Seller shall be required to sell its
shares to or through the underwriters or other parties upon terms generally
comparable to the terms applicable to shares being offered by Peters or others,
and (v) if any underwriter in good faith reasonably determines that the number
of shares sought to be included in the registration statement by Seller and any
other secondary holders of Peters stock proposed to be included in the
registration statement (including shares of Purchaser) is more than can be
reasonably sold at the proposed price, then the number of shares which Seller
and Purchaser will be permitted to include in such registration statement will
be reduced pro rata to an amount reasonably acceptable to the underwriter. The
registration rights set forth in this Section shall terminate at such time as
all of the Peters Shares held by Seller may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under
the Securities Act of 1933 during any three-month period and, if earlier, shall
terminate with respect to all Peters Shares transferred by Seller to any third
party immediately upon such transfer.

4.5 Tax Elections and Reporting. If the Closing
occurs as a stock purchase, Purchaser shall have the right to make the election
under Internal Revenue Code 338(h)(10) to treat this transaction as an asset
sale for tax purposes, and Seller agrees to join in any federal and state
elections relating thereto. Seller and Purchaser agree to coordinate and agree
upon the proper tax reporting of the transactions under this Agreement.

4.6 Indemnity by Seller and the Company. The
parties acknowledge that the Company currently has projects in various stages
of completion, including lots subject to option but not yet purchased, owned
lots, units under construction, completed units in inventory, completed units
subject to reservations or purchase agreements and units already sold and
subject to warranty claims and other potential claims for defects in materials
and workmanship, breaches of contracts, etc. (collectively, "Sales Claims").
Seller hereby agrees to

11
<PAGE> 15
indemnify Purchaser and the Company and their respective officers, employees,
directors and other agents, and hold them harmless and defend them (by counsel
selected by them reasonably acceptable to Seller) from and against any and all
claims, demands, liabilities, liens, costs, expenses, penalties, damages and
losses, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and court costs actually
and reasonably incurred by Purchaser and arising out of (i) Sales Claims
relating to any dwelling unit sold by the Company prior to the Release Date or
any transaction relating to any such dwelling unit, (ii) any breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller or the Company
contained in this Agreement (even if the damaged party knew, had reason to know
or is deemed to know of any such breach at the time of the Release Date), (iii)
any federal, state or local income, franchise, employment, workers'
compensation, property or other tax or similar imposition against Seller or the
Company required to be paid or withheld, but not so paid or withheld, prior to
the Release Date, and (iv) any other liability or obligation of the Company or
Seller relating to the Company accruing, or arising out of any event occurring,
prior to the Release Date, except for liabilities contained in the Financial
Statements or described in attached Exhibits F, G or H attached hereto.

4.7 Indemnification by Purchaser. The parties
acknowledge that Seller has signed personal guaranties with respect to various
liabilities of the Company to unrelated third parties, as described in attached
Exhibit J (the "Guaranties"). If the Closing occurs, Purchaser hereby agrees
to indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless and defend Seller (by counsel
selected by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to Seller) from and against any
and all claims, demands, liabilities, liens, costs, expenses, penalties,
damages and losses, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and court
costs actually and reasonably incurred by Seller and arising out of (i) the
Loan Guaranties except to the extent payment is required of Seller thereunder
due to any event occurring prior to the Release Date, including, but not
limited to, any pre-Release Date breaches of covenants or conditions or
misrepresentations by the Company or Seller, (ii) any breach of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement (even if Seller knew, had reason to know or is deemed to know of
any such breach at the time of the Release Date), (iii) any federal, state or
local income, franchise, employment, workers' compensation, property or other
tax or similar imposition against Purchaser or the Company applicable to any
period after the Release Date, and (iv) any other liability or obligation of
the Company or Purchaser relating to the Company accruing, or arising out of
any event occurring, after the Release Date, except for any matter covered by
Seller's indemnities set forth in Section 4.7 above.

12
<PAGE> 16
4.8 Covenant Not to Compete. Without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, Seller shall not directly or indirectly (whether
through any partnership which Seller is a member, as a consultant, through a
trust of which Seller is a beneficiary or trustee, through a corporation or
other association in which Seller has any interest, legal or equitable, or as
an employee or in any other capacity whatsoever) engage in the businesses of
acquisition, ownership, development, construction or sale of dwelling units in
any county in the United States in which Purchaser, the Company or Peters may
conduct business from time to time. Seller's covenant not to compete shall
extend until five (5) years after the date of the Release Date as to Clark 
County, Nevada, and three (3) years after the Closing as to any other county 
in the United States in which Purchaser, the Company or Peters conducts 
business from time to time, plus any additional period during which Seller or 
any affiliated party (i.e., any member of Seller's immediate family or any 
partnership, corporation, trust or other association in which Seller or any 
member of Seller's immediate family has a legal or equitable interest) 
continues to own any stock in Peters. In addition to the foregoing, until 
five (5) years after the date of the Closing as to any business or transaction 
in Clark County, Nevada, and until three (3) years after the Closing as to any 
business or transaction in any other county in the United States, Seller shall 
not hire, solicit for hire, or otherwise engage in any business transaction 
with, any current employee of the Company, whether as an employee, associate, 
partner, consultant or other business relation. Seller and Purchaser agree 
that the duration and area as to which Seller's covenant not to compete and
nonsolicitation covenant are to be effective are reasonable and directly relate
to providing Purchaser with the reasonable benefits of its bargain as to the
value of the Durable Shares and to the Company's ability to be reasonably
profitable in the future. In the event that any court determines that Seller's
covenant not to compete or nonsolicitation covenant is unreasonable and
unenforceable as to time period or area, or both, Seller and Purchaser agree
that Seller's covenants shall remain in full force and effect for the greatest
time period and in the greatest area that does not render the covenants
unenforceable. Seller and Purchaser intend that Seller's covenant not to
compete and nonsolicitation covenant each shall be deemed to be a series of
separate covenants, one for each and every county described above in this
Section.

4.9 Consulting Agreement. For the period ending
one (1) year following the Release Date, Seller agrees to provide consulting
services to Purchaser and the Company as reasonably requested, including
attending meetings relating to the Company's business with lenders,
governmental officials and other third parties. As part of Seller's
obligations under this Section, Seller shall expend such time and effort as is
necessary to cause

13
<PAGE> 17
an orderly transition of management and decision making at the Company to help
ensure that the business operations and relationships of the Company are not
interrupted, impeded or otherwise compromised. In addition, after the one-year
primary period of consulting specified above, Seller shall continue to
cooperate with the Company and its officers and directors, without additional
compensation, to answer questions, advise from time to time and assist the
Company in legal and other proceedings concerning matters occurring or accruing
prior to the Closing. To compensate Seller for his services pursuant to this
Section, Purchaser shall pay, or shall cause the Company to pay, to Seller the
sum of $218,000 in twelve (12) monthly installments of $18,167, beginning on
the date one (1) month after the date of the Release Date. Seller shall not be
an employee of Purchaser or the Company, but will perform services under this
Section in the capacity of an independent contractor. Seller shall perform
such services in accordance with his own methods and means and shall not be
subject to control by the Company or Purchaser as to the methods of work or the
times, hours or locations of work (except for Seller's reasonable cooperation
as to the scheduling of meetings and fulfillment of reasonable deadlines).
Seller understands that, since he will not be an employee of the Company or
Purchaser, no amount for federal, state or municipal taxes will be withheld
from amounts paid to him pursuant to the Section, and neither the Company nor
Purchaser shall be obligated to make any payments on Seller's behalf relating
to disability, workers' compensation, hospitalization, insurance or other
similar matters. As to any payments that the Company or Purchaser may be
required to make pursuant to law on behalf of Seller in connection with this
services under this Section, all such payments, to the extent permitted by law,
shall be deducted from the amounts otherwise payable to Seller pursuant to this
Section. The Company shall be a third-party beneficiary to the provisions of
this Section.

4.10 Legends on Certificates. Upon delivery to
Seller, all certificates evidencing the Peters Shares shall be endorsed with
the following or substantially similar legend:

THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO OR FOR SALE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
DISTRIBUTION THEREOF AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED ("SECURITIES ACT"). THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT
BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, OR ASSIGNED UNLESS THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT COVERING SUCH
SECURITIES OR THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE
HOLDER OF THESE SECURITIES, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY
SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY'S COUNSEL, STATING THAT SUCH SALE,
TRANSFER, OR ASSIGNMENT IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS
DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND FROM THE REGISTRATION
OR

14
<PAGE> 18
QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

4.11 Confidentiality. Except as otherwise
required by law, Seller and the Company shall keep strictly confidential all
information and documentation relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the fact that such transactions are contemplated), and
shall not disclose any information or documentation relating to such
transactions to any person or entity other than those employees or agents of
the Company to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the
Closing does not occur, the foregoing provisions of this Section will continue
in force in perpetuity. Upon the Closing, if it occurs, the form and content
of all press releases or other public communications by or on behalf of Seller
of the Company shall be subject to the approval of Purchaser and Peters for a
period of six (6) months after the Closing, and, except as otherwise required
by law, Seller shall continue to keep the terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement strictly confidential and shall not
disclose them to any person or entity other than private communications to
Seller's attorneys, accountants and other parties to the extent they reasonably
need to know such information.

15
<PAGE> 19
Purchaser shall have the right to cause Seller to sell
the Subject Shares to any third party who acquires all of the shares of Peters
stock owned by Capital Pacific Homes, Inc., by giving Seller written notice of
such election to sell (the "Sale Notice") at any time and from time to time.
In the event of a sale of Subject Shares pursuant to this paragraph by a buyer
of Peters stock owned by Capital Pacific Homes, Inc., the sale price and other
terms of the sale shall be the same as the price and terms at which Capital
Pacific Homes, Inc. sells it shares of Peters stock to such buyer. The closing
of such sale of Subject Shares shall occur concurrently with the closing of the
sale of Peters stock owned by Capital Pacific Homes, Inc. to such buyer.

Upon and at all times subsequent to delivery to Seller,
all certificates evidencing the Peters Shares will be endorsed with the
following or substantially similar legend:

THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A FIVE
YEAR OPTION TO REPURCHASE AND AN OPTION TO CAUSE A SALE TO A THIRD
PARTY, EACH GRANTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 4.12 OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT
DATED SEPTEMBER 17, 1993 AMONG ROGER NIX, CAPITAL PACIFIC HOMES, INC.,
AND DURABLE HOMES, INC., THE RELEVANT PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE AVAILABLE
AT THE OFFICES OF THE ISSUER. NO TRANSFER OF SUCH SECURITIES WILL BE
EFFECTED ON THE BOOKS OF THE ISSUER UNLESS ACCOMPANIED BY EVIDENCE OF
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER CONTAINED IN THE PURCHASE
AGREEMENT.

Prior to effecting any transfer of the Peters Shares, Seller (and any
subsequent holder) shall obtain from any proposed transferee, and provide to
Purchaser, such proposed transferee's acknowledgement of, and agreement to be
bound by, the terms of this Section 4.12.
