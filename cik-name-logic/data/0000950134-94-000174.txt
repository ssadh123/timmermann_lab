BELO BUYS STATION WWL-TV
IN NEW ORLEANS

A. H. Belo Corporation and Rampart Operating Partnership announced
today they have reached an agreement in principle for Belo to acquire the
assets of WWL-TV, the CBS affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, for $110 million
in cash.

The sale is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement
and approvals of the transaction by the appropriate federal agencies. The
agreement in principle was approved today by Belo's Board of Directors and the
principals of Rampart.

The announcement was made jointly by Belo and WWL-TV president and
general manager, J. Michael Early. Mr. Early led an employee group that
purchased the station from Loyola University of New Orleans in 1990.

Robert W. Decherd, chairman of the board, president and chief
executive officer of Belo, said, "WWL-TV has a long-standing reputation as a
station committed to its public, with news presence and market coverage
equalled by few in the nation. WWL is a good neighbor and a good citizen. We
believe that the location of WWL, combined with its unusually strong audience
shares, provides an opportunity for Belo to work effectively on a regional
basis in the television business. Mike Early, who has guided WWL for the past
33 years, has made the station a force for good in the New Orleans community."

Barry Lewis, spokesman for Sandler Capital Management, an investor in
Rampart, said, "WWL-TV has continued to perform well in the New Orleans market
during Rampart's ownership. With its national reputation and strong market
position, WWL is a good fit with Belo's television operations and we feel the
two are an ideal match. Belo has a proven track record of community involvement
and journalistic excellence; like WWL, Belo is dedicated to a strong, vigorous
news operation."

Belo Buys WWL-TV in New Orleans

WWL-TV will become a part of Belo's Broadcast Division headed by Ward
L. Huey, Jr., president and vice chairman of Belo's Board of Directors. Mr.
Huey said, "WWL-TV is one of the great television franchises in America. We are
fortunate to have someone of Mike Early's stature to help us make the
transition of WWL to the Belo television group. I'm counting on his continued
presence and guidance."

Mr. Early has been general manager of WWL-TV since 1961 and the chief
architect in its rise from also-ran to market leadership for the past 25 years.
It was his idea to form the employee group to buy the station from Loyola
University and the Jesuit Fathers. Mr. Early and Mr. Lewis worked to put
together the financing for that transaction.

WWL-TV has a long and proud history in New Orleans. It began
operations in 1957, but its parent, WWL-AM radio, was a pioneer in American
broadcasting, dating back to 1912 and a hand-built transmitter on the Loyola
University campus. Loyola sold WWL-AM in 1989. WWL-TV was sold to the employee
group in August of 1990.

The station is one of the most honored in American television. Its
news operation has won the Edward R. Murrow Award twice in the last seven
years. It has won the George Foster Peabody Award four times. It has won a
national Emmy Award, the Overseas Press Club Award and almost every other major
award in American television.

Its daily editorial is the oldest, longest-running broadcast editorial
in America, dating back to March 26, 1962. It has been honored twice by the
Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi, with its national
editorial prize.

WWL-TV was one of the first stations in the country to program a local
cable channel to distribute its news programs. Its "NewsWatch" operation on Cox
Cable's Channel 15 in New Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Charles Parishes, reaches
almost 250,000 homes on a 24-hour-a-day basis.
