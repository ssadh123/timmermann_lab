BANPONCE CORPORATION

Exhibit 99(a)

December 15, 1994

PRESS RELEASE

BANPONCE MAY REPURCHASE UP TO 1 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

Mr. Richard L. Carrion, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer of BanPonce Corporation, announced today that the Board of
Directors has authorized the Corporation's repurchase of up to 1 million
shares, par value $6.00 per share, of the outstanding common stock of the
Corporation.

The repurchase would be made in the open market at such times and prices
as market conditions shall warrant.

Mr. Carrion explained that the repurchase program is being implemented
because Management and the Board of Directors believe that due to current
market conditions the price of the common stock represents a good investment
for the Corporation.

The 1 million shares authorized to be repurchased constitute 3.05% of
the 32,838,128 shares of BanPonce common stock currently outstanding.

As of September 30, 1994, BanPonce Corporation's Tier 1 Capital Ratio
was 12.90%, Total Capital was 14.31% and the Leverage Ratio was 7.56%.
Assuming that 1 million shares of common stock of the Corporation were
repurchased, the ratios specified as of September 30, 1994, would have been
adjusted as follows: the Tier 1 Capital Ratio would be 12.54%, the total
Capital Ratio would be 13.95% and the Leverage Ratio would be 7.34%.

For further information, please contact Mr. David H. Chafey, Jr.,
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, at telephone 
(809) 751-4566.
