Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On October 30, 1993, WorldCorp, Inc. ("WorldCorp"), World Airways, Inc.
("World Airways") and Malaysian Helicopter Services Berhad ("MHS") entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") pursuant to
which MHS, subject to satisfactory completion of its due diligence
investigations, agreed to purchase 24.9% of World Airways' common stock for
$27.4 million in cash. Under this Agreement, World Airways would receive
$12.4 million upon closing (the "Closing"), which it intends to use to fund
its working capital requirements. The remaining $15 million would be paid
to WorldCorp, which it intends to add to its cash reserves. At the time of
the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, World Airways was a wholly-
owned subsidiary of WorldCorp.

On February 28, 1994, WorldCorp, World Airways and MHS concluded the
transaction according to the terms described above (the "Closing Date"). As
a result of this transaction, WorldCorp will recognize a gain of
approximately $27.0 million. The MHS investment is governed by the terms
and conditions of: (i) a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of October
30, 1993, between World Airways and MHS (the "Registration Rights
Agreement"); (ii) a Shareholders Agreement dated as of February 3, 1994,
among WorldCorp, World Airways and MHS (the "Original Shareholders
Agreement"), as amended by that certain Amendment No.1 to Shareholders
Agreement dated as of February 28, 1994, among WorldCorp, World Airways and
MHS ("Amendment No. 1") (the Original Shareholders Agreement and Amendment
No. 1 being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Shareholders
Agreement"); and (iii) a Right of First Refusal Agreement dated as of
February 28, 1994, between US Order, Inc. ("US Order") and Technology
Resources, Inc. Berhad ("TRI") (the "Right of First Refusal Agreement").

MHS recently announced that it will acquire 32% of Malaysian Airline
System Berhad ("MAS"), the flag carrier of Malaysia. MAS is one of World
Airways' largest commercial customers.

According to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, if at any
time occurring subsequent to the third anniversary of the date of the
Agreement (i.e., at any time after October 30, 1996), World Airways proposes
to register any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, World Airways is required to give prompt, written notice to MHS of
its intention to do so, and it is required to include in such registration
any shares that MHS shall so specify, subject to certain exclusions set
forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions as hereinafter described, MHS agrees not
to sell or transfer any of its World Airways shares for three (3) years
after the Closing Date.

MHS is permitted to sell or transfer all or a portion of its shares to
a wholly-owned subsidiary.

If without the prior written consent of MHS: (1) World Airways sells
all or substantially all of its business; or (2) World Airways fundamentally
changes its line of business (these events being hereinafter referred to as
"Fundamental Change Events"), then MHS has the option (a) to sell or
transfer all or a portion of its shares to a third party notwithstanding the
aforementioned three-year holding period; and/or (b) to require WorldCorp to
purchase all or part of MHS's shares at fair market value (the "Put 

<PAGE>
Rights"). Fair market value must not be less than the aggregate of the
costs borne by MHS in acquiring and holding its World Airways shares.

If without the prior written consent of MHS, WorldCorp disposes of its
holdings in World Airways so that WorldCorp's ownership in World Airways
falls below 51% of the voting capital stock of World Airways (a "Disposal
Event"), then MHS has the option (a) to sell or transfer all or a portion of
its World Airways shares to a third party notwithstanding the three-year
holding period; or (b) to require WorldCorp to sell to the party purchasing
WorldCorp's shares in World Airways as a result of such Disposal Event a
percentage of the total voting capital stock of World Airways held by MHS
that is not less than the percentage by which WorldCorp's ownership falls
below 51% (the "Co-Sale Rights"). By way of example, if WorldCorp sold
voting capital stock of World Airways so that its ownership fell to 45%, MHS
would have the option to require WorldCorp to sell to the party purchasing
the WorldCorp shares in World Airways an amount of the total voting capital
stock of World Airways held by MHS equal to 6% of the total voting capital
stock of World Airways.

In the event World Airways wishes to issue, or WorldCorp wishes to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of its World Airways
Common Stock, and WorldCorp or World Airways has received a bona fide offer
from a third party to purchase any or all of said shares, WorldCorp or World
Airways, as the case may be, shall, before conveying any interest in such
shares, offer such shares to MHS on the same terms.

In addition to MHS's rights of first refusal, MHS has the right to
purchase shares of World Airways in order to maintain its percentage
ownership of World Airways issued and outstanding shares. World Airways is
required to deliver to MHS a written notice (the "Dilution Notice")
indicating the number of shares (the "Additional Shares") that MHS may
acquire in order to maintain its ownership position in connection with any
increase in World Airways issued and outstanding shares. The Dilution
Notice is to set forth the per share price for such Additional Shares which
shall be (i) the same price as the per share price proposed in any Bona Fide
Offer received from a third party, or (ii) in the case of a public offering,
the cash price per share at which World Airways shares are offered in such
offering.

Each party to the Shareholders Agreement is entitled to that number of
Directors that as nearly as possible reflects its proportionate voting
rights in respect of World Airways common stock, and in any event, MHS is
entitled to a minimum of two (2) directors.

Attached to the Shareholders Agreement is a Schedule of so-called
"Reserved Matters." These are matters that cannot be approved without the
consent of the MHS directors. For example, the World Airways Board of
Directors may not, without the concurrence of the MHS Directors, do or
suffer to be done any act or thing whereby World Airways may be wound up
(whether voluntarily or involuntarily), except as otherwise expressly
provided for in the Shareholders Agreement and cannot acquire any securities
or assets, create any guarantees, or incur any debt or other expenditure in
excess of $500,000, unless in the ordinary course of aviation or travel
business.

According to the terms of the Right of First Refusal Agreement, in the
event that US Order wishes to license its Licensed Technology (which term is
defined in the Right of First Refusal Agreement) in Malaysia, and US Order
has received from a third party a bona fide offer to license US Order's 

<PAGE>
Licensed Technology in Malaysia, US Order is required, before granting any
such license, to offer to TRI the right of first refusal to license the
Licensed Technology in Malaysia on the same terms as set forth in such bona
fide offer. WorldCorp is a significant shareholder in US Order and TRI is a
significant shareholder in MHS. 

The foregoing descriptions do not purport to be complete and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the Stock Purchase Agreement,
the Registration Rights Agreement, the Shareholders Agreement, and the Right
of First Refusal Agreement, copies of which are filed as Exhibits to this
Current Report on Form 8-K.

laws of the State of Delaware and each has full corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business. 
The Company is duly qualified and licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions set forth
in Schedule 2.02, which are all the jurisdictions in which such
qualification is required except jurisdictions, individually or in the
aggregate, in which the Company's failure to so qualify to do business will

Incorporation of the Company, and all amendments thereto, and the By-Laws of

Company and the Shareholder, as the case may be, enforceable against each in
accordance with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or

and all applicable state securities laws. Except as contemplated in Article
VIII hereof, there are no outstanding rights to either demand registration
of any Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to sell any

Shareholder and the Company hereby agree to amend the Certificate of

outstanding, and shall be fully paid and nonassessable and issued pursuant
to a valid exemption from registration under the Act and all applicable
state securities laws. Except as contemplated in Article VIII hereof, there
shall be no outstanding rights to either demand registration of any Shares
under the Act or to sell any Shares in connection with such a registration
of Common Stock.

2.05 No Conflict. Except as stated in Schedule 2.05 and Schedule
2.11, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company or the Shareholder, as the case may be, nor the consummation by
the Company or the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby will (i) conflict with or result in a violation, contravention or
breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, or By-Laws, as amended, of the Company or the
Shareholder, (ii) result in a Default under or require the consent or
approval of any party to any material Contract of the Shareholder or the
Company other than such consents or approvals as which have been obtained,
(iii) result in the violation of any Regulation or Order the violation of
which would have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien upon any asset of the Company or the Shares.

not currently have, any Subsidiaries other than World Airways Cargo, Inc., a
Delaware corporation. 

2.07 Financial Statements; Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

<PAGE>

(a) The Company has (or the Shareholder on behalf of
the Company has) either (i) timely filed with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities or (ii) obtained valid extensions of time for filing (which
extensions have not expired) from the appropriate Governmental Authorities,
all Tax Returns (including any consolidated or combined Tax Return in which
the Company joins) required to be filed on or prior to the date hereof by
the Company in all jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to
be filed, and, to the knowledge of the Shareholder and the Company, such Tax
Returns are correct and complete and properly reflect the Liabilities for
Taxes of the Company (or any other Person joining in a Tax Return of the
Company ) for the periods, property or events covered thereby. All Taxes
and deposits for Taxes attributable to the Company (or any other Person
joining in a Tax Return of the Company) required to be paid or deposited
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any period ending on or before the
Closing Date have been paid and appropriate deposits made therefor and to
the extent required to be paid or deposited on or after the Closing Date
will be fully paid, in each instance to the extent not accrued or reserved
for in the September 30, 1993 Balance Sheet (excluding deferred Taxes). No
basis exists for any additional assessment of any Taxes.

(b) The reserves for Taxes (except for deferred Taxes)
in the September 30, 1993 Balance Sheet are sufficient for the payment of
all unpaid Liabilities for Taxes of the Company (whether or not disputed)
for all activities which occurred and all assets owned during the periods
ended on or before the September 30, 1993 Balance Sheet Date. Since the
September 30, 1993 Balance Sheet Date, the Company has not incurred any
Liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice. Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.09, the Company has
not been delinquent in the payment of any Tax, assessment, deposit or other
charge by any Governmental Authority and no Liability is pending or has been
assessed, asserted or threatened against the Company or any of its assets in
connection with any Tax and there is no basis for any such claim or
Liability. Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.09, the Company has not
received any notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection with
any Tax Returns that have not been previously resolved and paid in full and
to the Knowledge of the Shareholder or the Company there are no pending Tax
examinations of or Tax claims asserted against the Company or any of its
assets, including without limitation, any claim by any Governmental
Authority in any jurisdiction where the Company did not file Tax Returns
that the Company is or may be subject to or liable for Taxes imposed by that
Governmental Authority or jurisdiction. There are no Liens except for
Permitted Liens for any Taxes on any of the assets of the Company.

(c) The United States federal income tax returns of the
Company (including consolidated federal income tax returns of which the
Company is a member) are closed by statute for all periods through December
31, 1989. Except as identified on Schedule 2.09, there are no currently
pending examinations or audits and there is not now in force any extension
of time with respect to the date on which any Tax Return was or is due to be
filed by or with respect to the Company or any other Person joining in a Tax
Return of the Company or either of their assets, or any extension (by
waiver, agreement or otherwise) of time for the assessment or collection of
any Tax. Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.09, there is no claim or
assessment pending or, to the Shareholder's or the Company's Knowledge,
threatened against the Company or any of its Affiliates with which it files 

<PAGE>
a consolidated or combined income tax return ("Tax Affiliates") for any
alleged deficiency in Taxes, and neither the Shareholder nor the Company
knows of any audit or investigation with respect to any Liability of the
Company or any of its Tax Affiliates. Except as disclosed on Schedule 2.09,
neither the Company nor any other Person joining in a Tax Return of the
Company has (a) granted any extension of the limitation period applicable to
any Tax claims or (b) filed any consent under Section 341(f) of the Code,
relating to collapsible corporations. No Tax is required to be withheld
pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code as a result of any of the transfers
contemplated by this Agreement and the Company will provide any certificate
requested by the Purchaser at Closing with respect thereto. There is no
Contract or intercompany account system in existence under which the Company
has, or may at any time in the future have an obligation to contribute to
the payment of any portion of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined
or unitary basis with respect to a group of corporations of which the
company is or was a part.

2.10 Litigation and Orders. Except as disclosed on Schedule
2.10, there are no outstanding Orders applicable to or binding upon the
Company, its assets, or the Shareholder, with respect to the Shares, and,
except as disclosed on Schedule 2.10, there is no Litigation pending, or, to
the Knowledge of the Shareholder or the Company, threatened or contemplated,
and to the Knowledge of the Shareholder or the Company, there is no basis
for any such Litigation or any state of facts or occurrence of any event
which is reasonably likely to give rise to the foregoing. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 2.10, the Company has not been advised by any attorney
representing it that there are any "loss contingencies" (as defined in
Statement of Financing Accounting Standards No. 5 issued by the Financial

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND
INDEMNIFICATION

4.01 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

(a) All representations, warranties, agreements,
covenants and obligations made or undertaken by the Shareholder or the
Company in this Agreement are material, have been relied upon by the
Purchaser and shall survive the Closing and shall not merge in the
performance of any obligation by any party hereto and shall terminate and
expire on October 30, 1995.

(b) All representations, warranties, agreements,
covenants and obligations made by the Purchaser in this Agreement are
material, have been relied upon by the Shareholder and the Company and shall
survive the Closing and shall not merge in the performance of any obligation
by any party hereto and shall terminate and expire on October 30, 1995.

(c) The Shareholder and the Company acknowledge and
agree that prior to the Closing Date the Purchaser intends to perform such
investigation of the Company as it may deem necessary or appropriate;
however, no investigation by the Purchaser will diminish or obviate any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or indemnities made
or to be performed by the Shareholder or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement or the Purchaser's right to fully rely upon such representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, neither of the Shareholder, the Company nor the
Purchaser shall have any liability hereunder for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 4.02 hereof of which the Person making a
claim for indemnification hereunder had actual Knowledge prior to Closing.

(d) The representations and warranties made by the
Shareholder, the Company, and the Purchaser and contained in Articles II and
III of this Agreement are deemed by the parties hereto to have been made by
the Shareholder, the Company, and the Purchaser, as the case may be, on and
as of the date hereof and the Closing Date with the same force and effect as
if this Agreement was executed by the Shareholder, the Company, and the
Purchaser on each of the date hereof and the Closing Date.

4.02 Indemnity for Breach of Representations or Warranties. The
Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification from the Company and the
Shareholder, and the Company and the Shareholder shall be entitled to
indemnification from the Purchaser, as the case may be (the "Indemnifying
Party", as defined in Section 4.03 hereof), for any loss caused to any
Indemnitee (as defined in Section 4.03 hereof) by virtue of the fact that
(i) any representation or warranty made by the Indemnifying Party was false
or misleading when made, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party made, to the
detrimental reliance of any Indemnitee, an untrue statement of material fact
or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading. 

4.03 Notice of Loss or Asserted Liability. Promptly after (a)
becoming aware of circumstances that reasonably would be expected to result
in a Loss for which any party hereto (the "Indemnitee") intends to seek
indemnification under this Article IV or (b) receipt by the Indemnitee of
written notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse 

<PAGE>
of time, the giving of notice or both, would give rise to a claim or the
commencement (or threatened commencement) of any Litigation (an "Asserted
Liability") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice
thereof (the "Claims Notice") to any other party obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to this Article IV (the "Indemnifying Party");
provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnitee to give notice
promptly shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
this Article IV except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Party
shall have been prejudiced thereby. Any Loss or Asserted Liability for
which a Claims Notice has been delivered shall hereinafter be defined as a
"Claim." The Claims Notice shall describe the Claim in reasonable detail,
and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Claim that
has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. The Claims Notices may be
amended on one or more occasions with respect to the amount of the Claims at
any time prior to final resolution of the obligation to indemnify relating
to the Claim.

4.04 Opportunity to Contest. The Indemnifying Party may elect to
compromise or contest, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any
Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or
contest such Asserted Liability, it shall within thirty (30) days (or
sooner, if the nature of the Asserted Liability so requires) notify the
Indemnitee or Indemnitees of its intent to do so by sending a notice to the
Indemnitee or Indemnitees (the "Contest Notice"), and the Indemnitee shall
cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise or
contest of such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or contest the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee
of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify
under this Agreement, the Indemnitee (upon further notice to the
Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to pay, compromise or contest such
Asserted Liability on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume
the compromise or contest of such Asserted Liability at any time before
final settlement of determination thereof. Anything in this Section 4.04 to
the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Indemnitee shall have the right, at
its own cost and expense and for its own account to compromise or contest
any Asserted Liability, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the Indemnitee's written consent, settle or compromise any Asserted
Liability or consent to entry of any judgment which does not include an
unconditional term releasing the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of
such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to contest any
Asserted Liability the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnifying
Party any books, records or other documents within its control that are
necessary or appropriate for, shall make its officers and employees
available, on a basis reasonably consistent with their other duties, in
connection with, and shall otherwise cooperate with, such defense.

4.05 Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Company nor the
Shareholder shall be obligated to make cash payments to the Purchaser or any
of the other Persons specified in Article IV in excess of the total amount
of actual cash payments made by the Purchaser to the Shareholder and the
Company pursuant to this Agreement.

4.06 Subrogation Rights. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee pursuant to this
Article IV, the Indemnifying Party shall, upon payment of such indemnity in 

<PAGE>
full, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee with respect to the Loss
to which such indemnification relates; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall only be subrogated to the extent of any amount paid
by it pursuant to this Article IV in connection with such Loss.

Litigation

On August 11, 1992, the Company, WorldCorp, Inc., and certain other
commercial paper customers of Washington Bancorporation ("WBC") were
served with a complaint by WBC as debtor-in-possession by and
through the Committee of Unsecured Creditors of WBC (the
"Committee"). The complaint arises from investment proceeds
totalling $6.8 million received by WorldCorp and the Company from
WBC in May 1990 in connection with the maturity of WBC commercial
paper. The Committee seeks to recover this amount on the grounds
that these payments constituted voidable preferences and/or
fraudulent conveyances under the United States Bankruptcy Code and
under applicable state law. WorldCorp filed a motion to dismiss
this litigation as it pertains to it and to the Company on June 9,
1993 and the Company intends to vigorously contest the liability. 
No assurances can be given of the eventual outcome of this
litigation.

There is a dispute between Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York
("MONY"), as supported by WBC, and other significant creditors as to
the benefits of the continued prosecution of the litigation. MONY
and WBC have moved for authorization for MONY to prosecute the
adversary proceedings and the FDIC has opposed the motion.

Collective Bargaining Negotiations

1. Cockpit Crewmembers. The amendable date of the collective
bargaining agreement between the Company and the cockpit crewmembers
was July 1, 1992. Bargaining did not begin in earnest until August
of 1992 due to the Company's spring operations. Since that time the
negotiating committees have met on a regular basis. There have been
approximately ten to twelve bargaining sessions which normally last
anywhere from three to five days. In December of 1992 the parties
jointly agreed to utilize the services of the National Mediation
Board and requested that the Board appoint a mediator to assist in
the negotiations. The mediator appointed has been involved in all
contract negotiation sessions in 1993.

The National Mediation Board Rules and Regulations and the Railway
Labor Act contemplate a lengthy and complex process. The purpose of
this lengthy and complex process is to avoid work stoppages.

2. Flight Attendants. The amendable date of the collective bargaining
agreement between the Company and the flight attendants was July 1,
1992. The parties exchanged their opening proposals in 1992 and
have had several contract negotiation sessions. The Airline
Division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the
"Teamsters") changed the representative responsible for the
Company's flight attendant negotiations, and as a result there have
been very few meetings. The new Teamsters representative and the
bargaining committee recently submitted a completely revised opening
proposal to the Company which negates some of the discussions that
have already been held. As a result, these negotiations are moving
more slowly. There has been no mediator assigned to these
negotiations either by request of the parties or by initiation of
the National Mediation Board, so it is likely that these
negotiations may not be concluded until after the cockpit
crewmembers' contract is finalized.

3. Dispatchers. This group of employees is represented by The
Transport Workers Union of America AFL-CIO (the "TWU") and the
amendable date of the contract was June 30, 1993. The TWU
representative assigned to the Company retired at the end of 1992
and a new representative has been assigned. The TWU committee
presented opening proposals in the summer of 1993, but no bargaining
sessions have been scheduled yet. Since there are relatively few
Company employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement,
it is anticipated that these negotiations will be resolved more
expeditiously than the pilot and flight attendant groups, however,
no bargaining has actually begun.

Malaysian Helicopter Services Berhad ("MHS").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Company and MHS are parties to a Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
pursuant to which MHS has agreed to purchase shares (collectively, the
"Shares") of the Common Stock of the Company, par value $.001 per share
("Common Stock") from the Company and the Company's parent, WorldCorp, Inc.
("WorldCorp"); and

WHEREAS, in order to facilitate the sale or other
disposition of the Shares by MHS the parties desire to enter into this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1. Incidental Registration. If at any time occurring
subsequent to the third anniversary hereof, the Company proposes to register
any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act") for its own account or for the account of any other person (other
than any registration of an offering solely to employees of the Company or
its subsidiaries), it shall promptly give written notice to MHS of its
intention to do so, and the Company shall include in such registration,
subject to Section 2 hereof, all Shares that MHS shall specify in a written
notice delivered to the Company within 20 days after its receipt of the
Company's notice of the proposed filing of the registration statement,
provided that the Company shall not be required to include in such
registration any Shares that MHS shall so specify if, in the unqualified
opinion of counsel to the Company reasonably acceptable to MHS so
specifying, registration under the Act is not required for the transfer of
such Shares in the manner requested by MHS or that a post-effective
amendment to an existing registration statement would be legally sufficient
for such transfer and the Company shall have obtained such a post-effective
amendment. MHS shall not have any incidental or other registration rights
prior to the third anniversary hereof.

2. Exclusion. If the proposed or required
registration is to be underwritten (whether on a "best efforts" or a "firm
commitment" basis), the managing underwriter shall have the right to exclude
all or any part of MHS's Shares if the underwriter advises the Company in
writing that it reasonably believes that such securities should be withdrawn
therefrom. Any exclusion of Shares shall be made pro rata among MHS and all
other persons participating in the registration in proportion to the
respective number of Shares or other securities for which MHS and each such
other person have requested registration.

3. Further Obligations and Conditions Relating to
Registration of Shares. Registration of Shares pursuant to Section 1 shall
be subject to the following:

(i) Information, Documents, Assignments, etc.
MHS shall furnish to the Company such information as the Company may
reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with any

<PAGE>
registration, qualification or compliance referred to herein. The Company
shall permit MHS's counsel to participate in meetings in connection with the
preparation of any registration statement prepared pursuant to Section 1
(but MHS shall be under no obligation to participate in any such meetings
and shall incur no liability for his failure to so participate). Before
filing any such registration statement or amendment or supplement thereto,
the Company shall furnish to MHS copies of all such documents proposed to be
filed. The Company shall promptly deliver to MHS copies of each such
registration statement and each amendment or supplement thereto as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Company shall
furnish to MHS the number of prospectuses, offering circulars or other
documents, and all amendments or supplements thereto, incident to each
registration, qualification or compliance as from time to time MHS may
reasonably request.

(ii) Underwriting Agreement. The Company and
MHS shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with
respect to the registration of the Shares pursuant to Section 1 hereof with
the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the
Company, which underwriting agreement shall provide for the completion of
the offering within 90 days of the effective date of the registration
statement, provided, however, that such underwriting agreement shall not
require MHS to indemnify the underwriter for any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or actions except those arising out of or based on an untrue
statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the underwriter by MHS for specific use in the
registration statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or
supplement.

(iii) Filing of Amendments. The Company shall file
such amendments and supplements to the registration statement and the
related prospectus and take such other action as may be necessary to keep
the registration statement effective and to comply with the Act for such
period, not exceeding 90 days from the original effective date of the
registration statement.

(iv) Blue Sky. The Company shall do any and all
acts and things which may be necessary or advisable to enable MHS to
consummate the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares and take
such action under the securities laws of such states as MHS shall reasonably
request, provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to file
any general consent to service of process, to qualify to do business as a
foreign corporation, or to otherwise subject itself to taxation in
connection with any such action, in any state.

(v) Expenses. The Company shall bear all of
the costs of registration and all related blue sky costs, including, but not
limited to, printing expenses, registration and filing fees, and fees and
disbursements of counsel and accountants for the Company (subject, however,
to subsection (vi) below), except that MHS shall pay the fees and
disbursements of its own counsel and the underwriting fees and selling
commissions applicable to the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this subsection, the Company shall not be required to pay any
of the costs or such expenses with respect to registration statements
prepared pursuant to Section 1 hereof unless the aggregate value of the
total number of Shares to be registered, including all Common Stock to be
registered by any other person, exceeds $5,000,000. In the event that the

<PAGE>
Company shall not be required to pay any of such costs or expenses, each
person participating in the registration shall bear its pro rata portion of
such costs or expenses.

(vi) Audits. The Company shall not be required
to furnish any audited statements at the request of MHS other than those
statements customarily prepared at the end of its fiscal year, unless MHS
shall agree to reimburse the Company for the out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company in the preparation of such other audited financial statements. 
The Company shall, however, furnish, without charge, copies of all such
unaudited financial statements as MHS shall reasonably request.

(vii) Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless MHS, each person who under the Act is deemed a controlling
person of MHS, and each underwriter for MHS against any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities to which MHS, controlling person or underwriter may
become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) shall arise out of or
be based upon any untrue or allegedly untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the registration statement, upon any related prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the registration
statement or any prospectus or preliminary prospectus or upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
shall reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by MHS,
controlling person or underwriter in connection with investigating or
defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to MHS, controlling
person or underwriter for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
actions insofar as the same shall arise out of or be based upon any such
untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished by MHS, controlling person or underwriter
seeking indemnification hereunder to the Company for use in the registration
statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or supplement. MHS
and each underwriter for MHS shall similarly indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its controlling persons and underwriters and all persons
participating in the registration against any such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or actions but only insofar as the same shall arise out of or be
based upon any untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished by such indemnifying person to
the Company for use in the registration statement, prospectus, preliminary
prospectus, amendment or supplement.

4. Contribution. In order to provide for just and
equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification
provided for in Section 3 above is due in accordance with its terms but is
for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the
Company shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, and
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) to which MHS may be subject in
such proportion so that the Company is responsible for that portion of such
losses, claims, charges, and liabilities for which it has agreed to
indemnify MHS pursuant to Section 3 above, provided that in no event shall
the Company be required to contribute to any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities that arise solely out of or are based upon written information
furnished by MHS to the Company for specific use in the registration
statement, prospectus, preliminary prospectus, amendment or supplement.

<PAGE>
5. Change in SEC Procedures or Forms. If the SEC
adopts new procedures or forms for public resales of restricted securities,
the Company shall take such action as may be demanded by MHS in order to
permit public resales of the Shares pursuant to such new procedures or forms
so long as the economic or other burden of compliance is not materially
greater than the burden contemplated by Sections 1-4 above.

6. Transfer of Registration Rights. It is expressly
understood and agreed that, to the extent MHS is permitted to transfer the
Shares under the Stock Purchase Agreement, MHS may transfer all of its
registration rights hereunder to any person; provided, however, that MHS
shall notify the Company of any such transfer and any transferee shall, if
such transferee desires to exercise registration rights hereunder, agree to
be bound with respect to such registration rights by the terms of the
Agreement.

have duly executed on its behalf, this Agreement as of the day and year
first above written.

specified in paragraph 3.4(b) of this

AMENDMENT NO 1 TO SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT

This AMENDMENT NO 1 TO SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT (the
"Amendment"), dated February 28, 1994 is by and among Malaysian Helicopter
Services Berhad ("MHS"), WorldCorp, Inc. ("WORLDCORP") and World Airways,
Inc. (the "COMPANY").

WHEREAS, MHS, WORLDCORP and the COMPANY (the "Parties") have
entered into that certain Shareholders Agreement dated February 3, 1994 (the
"Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Shareholders
Agreement in order to satisfy certain concerns of the United States
Department of Transportation; and

WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED AS FOLLOWS:-

1. The Parties agree that Clause 3.2 of the Agreement
shall be deleted in its entirety and that the following provision shall be
inserted in lieu thereof:

3.2 If, without the prior written consent of MHS: 
(1) the COMPANY sells all or substantially all of
the COMPANY'S business; or (2) the COMPANY
fundamentally changes its line of business (the
events described in clauses (1) and (2) herein
being hereinafter referred to as the "Fundamental
Change Events"), then MHS shall have the option (a)
to declare Clause 2.2 to be null and void and to
sell all or a portion of the Shares to a third
party; and/or (b) to require WORLDCORP to purchase
all or part of MHS's Shares at fair market value;
Provided Always that such value shall not be less
than the aggregate of the costs borne by MHS in
acquiring and holding those Shares. For this
purpose, the holding costs of MHS shall be computed
by applying the Prescribed Interest (as hereinafter
defined) to the costs borne by MHS in acquiring
those Shares calculated on a daily basis commencing
from the date such acquisition costs were incurred
to the date of the Fundamental Change Event. For
purposes of this Paragraph 3.2, the term
"Prescribed Interest" means a rate equivalent to
the average of the base lending rate of MALAYAN
BANKING BERHAD during the aforesaid period.

2. The Parties agree that Clause 3.3 of the Agreement
shall be deleted in its entirety and that the following provision shall be
inserted in lieu thereof:

3.3 If, without the prior consent of MHS,
WORLDCORP disposes of its holdings in the COMPANY
so that WORLDCORP's ownership in the COMPANY falls
below 51% of the voting capital stock of the
COMPANY (a "Disposal Event"), then notwithstanding

<PAGE>
any other provision of the Stock Purchase Agreement
or this Agreement, MHS shall have the option (a) to
declare Clause 2.2 null and void and to sell all or
a portion of the Shares to a third party or (b) to
require WORLDCORP to sell to the party purchasing
WORLDCORP's shares in the COMPANY as a result of
such Disposal Event a percentage of the total
voting capital stock of the COMPANY held by MHS
that is not less than the percentage by which
WORLDCORP's ownership falls below 51%. As an
example and for the avoidance of doubt, if
WORLDCORP sold voting capital stock of the COMPANY
so that its ownership of the COMPANY fell 45%,
WORLDCORP would be required to sell to the Party
purchasing the WORLDCORP shares in the COMPANY an
amount of the total voting capital stock of the
COMPANY held by MHS equal to 6% of the total voting
capital stock of the COMPANY.

3. The Parties agree that Clause 3.4 of the Agreement
shall be deleted in its entirety and that the following provision shall be
inserted in lieu thereof;

In the event the COMPANY wishes to issue, or
WORLDCORP wishes to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of
their Common Stock, and the COMPANY or WORLDCORP (herein, the "Seller") has
received, from a third party (herein a "Purchaser"), a Bona Fide Offer to
purchase or otherwise take delivery of any or all of the said shares, the
Seller shall, before conveying any interest in such shares, offer such
shares to MHS on the following terms and conditions:

(a) The Seller shall provide written notice (a
"Transfer Notification") to MHS of the Bona
Fide Offer to sell or otherwise dispose of
such shares. The Transfer Notification
shall (i) include a copy of the Bona Fide
Offer setting forth all of the terms of the
proposed transaction, including, without
limitation, the name and address of the
Purchaser, the number of shares to be
conveyed, the date of the Bona Fide Offer
and the terms of payment (if any) for such
shares; (ii) include the terms of any
transactions between the Seller and
Purchaser that reasonably could be expected
to influence the terms and conditions of
the Bona Fide Offer; and (iii) offer the
shares subject to the proposed transaction
to MHS at the price offered by the
Purchaser in the Bona Fide Offer.

(b) If MHS decides to purchase any or all of
the shares subject to the Bona Fide Offer,
MHS shall, within ten (10) days of receipt
of the Transfer Notification (i) notify the
Seller, in writing, of MHS's intent to
exercise its right of first refusal to
purchase the shares subject to the Bona

<PAGE>
Fide Offer and (ii) offer, in writing, to
purchase such shares at a price equal to
the price offered in the Bona Fide Offer
(hereinafter referred to as the "First
Refusal Offer").

(c) MHS's failure to provide the Seller with a
First Refusal Offer in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph 3.4(b) of this
Clause 3 shall constitute a waiver of MHS's
right of first refusal with respect to the
shares subject to the Bona Fide Offer for a
period of sixty (60) days from the
expiration of the ten (10) day period
specified in paragraph 3.4(b) of this
Clause 3 for the sole purpose of permitting
the Seller to accept the Bona Fide Offer on
the exact terms set forth therein. MHS's
right of first refusal shall reattach to
the shares subject to the Bona Fide Offer
in the event the Bona Fide Offer is not so
accepted within such sixty (60) day period.

(d) If MHS has agreed to pay the price offered
in the Bona Fide Offer or the Seller has
accepted the First Refusal Offer, the
Seller shall, within ten (10) days of such
acceptance of receipt of the first Refusal
Offer, whichever occurs first, submit the
appropriate share certificates to MHS
properly endorsed for transfer to MHS and
upon receipt of appropriate certificates so
endorsed, MHS shall remit to the Seller an
amount equal to the purchase price of such
shares.

(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs 3.4(a) through
3.4(d), the purchase of such shares by MHS
may not impair the COMPANY's U.S.
citizenship under the Federal Aviation Act
of 1958, as amended.

4. The Parties agree to add a new Clause 3.5 to the
Agreement as follows:

3.5 In the addition to the rights specified in
Clause 3.4, MHS shall have the right to purchase
shares of the COMPANY in order to maintain its
percentage ownership of the COMPANY's issued and
outstanding shares. The COMPANY shall deliver to
MHS a written notice (the "Dilution Notice")
indicating the number of additional shares (the
"Additional Shares") that MHS may acquire in order
to maintain its ownership position in connection
with any increase in the COMPANY's issued and
outstanding shares. Such Dilution Notice shall
also set forth the per share price for such

<PAGE> 
Additional Shares which shall be (a) the same price
as the per share price proposed in any Bona Fide
Offer under Clause 3.4 or (b) in the case of a
public offering, the cash price per share at which
shares of the COMPANY are offered in such offering. 
If within 30 days of the delivery of such Dilution
Notice, MHS advises the COMPANY in writing of its
desire to purchase such additional shares, the
COMPANY, or the underwriter in the case of a public
offering, shall sell and MHS shall purchase such
additional shares.

5. The Parties agree that Clause 6.1 of the Agreement
shall be deleted in its entirety and that the following provision shall be
inserted in lieu thereof:

6.1 Each Party shall be entitled to nominate a
number of Directors that as nearly as possible
reflects its proportionate voting rights in respect
of the COMPANY and in any event MHS shall be
entitled to nominate a minimum of two (2)
Directors, and MHS and WORLDCORP shall cast their
votes in their capacities as Shareholders to ensure
that each other's nominees are elected as
Directors. Either Party may at any time and in its
sole discretion by notice in writing to the other
terminate the nomination of any Director nominated
by it and nominate another person in his place and
each Party shall cooperate in effecting such change
of Directors. And in any event, in no instance
shall a Director nominated by MHS be removed from
his office without the consent of the Parties,
provided, however, that any Director of the
COMPANY, including a Director nominated by MHS, may
be removed for conduct defined in Article
Thirteenth of the COMPANY's Articles of
Incorporation as acts for which a Director may not
be indemnified by the COMPANY.

6. The Parties agree to add a new Clause 6.11 of the
Agreement as follows:

6.11 The nominee Directors of MHS shall not
constitute more than one-third of the Directors
appointed to serve on any Committee of the Board
established pursuant to Article III, Section 8 of
the COMPANY's By-Laws.

7. The Parties agree that Clause 17.3 of the Agreement
shall be deleted in its entirety and that the following provision shall be
inserted in lieu thereof:

17.3 The Parties agree that the Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the COMPANY,
appended to this Agreement as Appendix I and
Appendix II, are as stated, and that,
notwithstanding any other provision of the

<PAGE>
applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation and
the Bylaws, as hereto appended, shall not be

9. Except as expressly amended hereby, all terms and
conditions of the Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect.

offer to Grantee the right of first refusal to license the Licensed
Technology and on the following terms and conditions:-

(a) Grantor shall provide written notice (the

Licensed Technology. The License
Notification shall (i) include a copy of
the Bona Fide Offer setting forth all of
the terms of the proposed license; (ii)
include the terms of any transactions

(b) If Grantee decides to license the Licensed
Technology according to the terms of the
Bona Fide Offer, Grantee shall, within

License Notification (i) notify the
Grantor, in writing, of Grantee's intent to
exercise its right of first refusal to
license the Licensed Technology, and (ii)
offer, in writing, to license the Licensed

the Bona Fide Offer (hereinafter referred
to as the "First Refusal Offer").

(c) Grantee's failure to provide Grantor with a

period of sixty (60) days from the
expiration of the twenty one (21) day
period specified in paragraph 2(b) of this
Clause 2 for the sole purpose of permitting

reattach to the Licensed Technology subject
to the Bona Fide Offer in the event the
Bona Fide Offer is not so accepted within
such sixty (60) day period.

(d) If Grantee has agreed to license the
Licensed Technology according to the exact
terms of the Bona Fide Offer or Grantor has
accepted the First Refusal Offer, Grantor
shall, within ten (10) days of such
acceptance or receipt of the First Refusal
Offer, whichever occurs first, execute a
written license agreement and remit to
Grantee any payments due under said license
to Grantor.

2.1 Nothing in this Clause 2 shall preclude Grantee
from making an offer to Grantor to license Grantor's Licensed Technology,
even if Grantor has not received a Bona Fide Offer from a third party. In
the event Grantee desires to license Grantor's Licensed Technology, Grantee
shall so notify Grantor in writing and Grantor and Grantee shall promptly
negotiate, execute and deliver license agreement covering the Licensed
Technology in a form mutually acceptable to Grantor and Grantee.
