Item 2 Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
------------------------------------

(a) On May 25, 1994, Computer Associates International, Inc.
(the "Registrant") through a wholly owned subsidiary,
Speedbird Merge, Inc. ("Speedbird"), commenced a tender offer
for all of the approximately 23.5 million issued and
outstanding shares of The ASK Group, Inc. ("ASK") common stock
at a price of $13.25 per share in cash. The purchase price was
determined through a series of arms length negotiations
between officers and representatives of the Registrant and
ASK's representatives and Board of Directors. The offer was
made pursuant to a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of May 18, 1994 (the "Agreement") among the
Registrant, Speedbird and ASK. On June 23, 1994, the
Registrant through Speedbird accepted for payment
approximately 23.2 million shares of ASK's outstanding common
stock validly tendered in the offer.

ASK is in the business of developing, marketing and selling
computer-based relational database management systems, data
access and connectivity products, manufacturing and financial
software application development tools and providing related
consulting and support services. ASK's assets consist of cash,
receivables, property and equipment, purchased software
products and other tangible and intangible assets. ASK's
liabilities consist primarily of trade payables, normal
accruals, restructuring cost accruals taken during ASK's third
quarter ended March 31, 1994 and bank debt under revolving and
term loan facilities. The purchase price and associated
charges will be allocated among the identifiable tangible and
intangible assets of ASK based on their fair market value at
the acquisition date under the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations. The cost of purchased research and
development for that portion of the acquired technology that
has not reached the working model stage and has no alternative
future use will be written off against the Registrant's
earnings in its first quarter ending June 30, 1994. The after-
tax charge against earnings is initially estimated to be
approximately $155 million, or approximately $.89 per share.

The pending merger of ASK and Speedbird will become effective
as reasonably practicable after the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in, and subject to the terms of, the
Agreement (including, without limitation, the resolution of
certain matters, and the expiration of applicable notice
periods, under certain of ASK's stock option plans). Once the
pending merger becomes effective, ASK will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Registrant.

<PAGE> 3

The total funds needed to consummate the offer and the merger
is approximately $330 million. The Registrant has obtained and
will continue to obtain such funds from the Registrant's
general corporate funds and drawings under the Registrant's
$500 million Credit Agreement dated as of June 21, 1994,
between the Registrant, the banks and other financial
institutions party thereto and Credit Suisse, as Agent.

(b) ASK utilized its assets in its computer software business,
and the Registrant intends to continue such use in its own
software business.

Item 7 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
----------------------------------

(a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired.

The required financial statements of ASK were previously
reported in ASK's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended June 30, 1993 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended September 30, 1993, December 31, 1993 and March
31, 1994, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.
--------------------------------

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance
sheet as of March 31, 1994 and the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed income statement for the year ended March
31, 1994 gives effect to the merger of ASK as if it had
occurred on April 1, 1993 for purposes of the income statement
and as of March 31, 1994 for purposes of the balance sheet.
The unaudited pro forma information is based on the historical
financial statements of the Registrant and ASK giving effect
to the transaction under the "purchase" method of accounting
and the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying notes
to the pro forma financial statements.

The Registrant has a fiscal year end of March 31 while ASK has
a fiscal year end of June 30. As a result, the operations for
the twelve months ended March 31, 1994 for the Registrant have
been combined with the twelve months ended March 31, 1994 for
ASK. ASK's twelve month period was derived by adding ASK's
three months ended June 30, 1993 with its nine months ended
March 31, 1994.

The after-tax charge of $155 million resulting from purchased
research and development costs has been reflected in
stockholders' equity in the pro forma consolidated condensed
balance sheet at March 31, 1994. This same charge has been
excluded from the pro forma consolidated condensed income
statement for the year ended March 31, 1994 consistent with
Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X.

The unaudited pro forma statements have been prepared by the
Registrant's management based upon the financial information
of the Registrant and ASK. The pro forma information is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of
operations which would actually have been reported had the
acquisition been in effect during these periods or which may
be reported in the future. These unaudited pro forma financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the separate
notes to unaudited pro forma financial statements as well as
the audited financial statements and related notes thereto of
the Registrant and ASK.
