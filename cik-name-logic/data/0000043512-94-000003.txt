Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

(a) Historical financial statements are not included in this presentation 
because the Registrant, through Great Western Bank, a Federal Savings
Bank (the Bank), acquired certain assets and the customer deposits of
HomeFed. The historical financial data would not be meaningful to
this acquisition.

(b) The accompanying pro forma statement of financial condition as of 
September 30, 1993 and related proforma statement of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 1993 present the combination of
the Registrant and HomeFed and appropriate adjustments.

The following is a schedule showing the ratios of capital for the Bank
compared with the fully phased-in benchmark as provided under the Financial
Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 under regulations
issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision.

Note
- ----

(1) The Registrant assumed retail deposit liabilities of $4.1 billion and 
acquired $3.9 billion of cash and short-term securities, which was
used to repay borrowings not subject to prepayment penalties. Excess
cash was invested in mortgage-backed securities and other short-term
securities, all of which qualified for liquidity purposes.

Within 90 days of acquisition, the Registrant intends to reprice
customer term accounts down to rates similar to what the Registrant
offers on its term accounts. It is anticipated that cash will be
reduced from deposit outflows as a result of this repricing program.

As reflected in the accompanying Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed
Statement of Operations, the acquisition may be initially dilutive to
earnings. As the acquired branch network is consolidated and
integrated into the Registrant, economies of scale should be
realized.

The Registrant paid a premium to the RTC in the amount of $151.2
million for the deposits acquired. The premium will be amortized
over ten years, the average estimated life of the deposits assumed.
