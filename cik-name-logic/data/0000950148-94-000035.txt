OCC TERMINATES FORMAL AGREEMENT
WITH CITY NATIONAL BANK

Beverly Hills, California - City National Corporation
(NYSE:CYN) today announced that the formal agreement between the Bank and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has been terminated. The
agreement had been in effect since November 18, 1992.

Bram Goldsmith, chairman of the board and chief executive
officer, cited several major factors that contributed to the OCC's decision: a
successful rights offering of common stock that raised $81 million; a
significant improvement in the Bank's credit quality, enhanced by the
previously announced sale of nonperforming assets held for accelerated
disposition; a comprehensive three-year strategic plan; and, the overall
progress achieved toward improving the Bank's financial condition and earnings
capability.

"We are confident that our accomplishments over the past year
will continue to provide City National with a sold foundation for the future,"
Mr. Goldsmith said, "and have strategically positioned the Bank to further
enhance our tradition of personal relationship banking."

"We're gratified that the OCC has recognized the significant
accomplishments of City National Bank over the past 15 months," said Mr.
Goldsmith. "The dedication and support of our staff members and board of
directors played a central role in the lifting of the OCC agreement. Our
financial performance for the 1993 fourth quarter, representing City National's
third consecutive quarter of profitability, underscores the success of our
efforts

particular emphasis on mid-sized businesses, professionals and entrepreneurs."

Mr. Goldsmith also acknowledged the support and confidence of
City National's customers and shareholders during this challenging period.

headquartered in Beverly Hills, with offices in Los Angeles, Orange and San
Diego counties, is the principal subsidiary of City National Corporation.
