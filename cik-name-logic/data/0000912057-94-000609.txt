ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On February 15, 1994, Science Applications International Corporation (the
"Company") was served with a search warrant and a subpoena for documents and
records associated with the Company's performance under three contracts with the
Department of Defense ("DoD"). The search warrant and subpoena relate to the
Company's development of flat panel displays for avionic applications under
contracts known as the Horizontal Situation Indicator, the Air Navigational
Multiple Indicator and the Comanche Light Attack Helicopter. The search warrant
and the subpoena state that the government is seeking evidence regarding the
making of false statements and false claims to the DoD in violation of Title 18,
United States Code, Sections 1001 and 287, respectively, as well as conspiracy
to commit such offenses.

The Company has not been apprised of the details of the allegations that
the government is investigating nor has it been charged with any wrongdoing. The
Company is cooperating fully with the government in this investigation.

On February 15, 1994 and February 18, 1994, the Company released the press
releases attached hereto as Exhibits 28(a) and 28(b) with respect to the above,
which press releases are incorporated herein by reference.

Bull, Inc., a wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary of the Company, had
been scheduled to conduct a trade for the Company's limited secondary market on
