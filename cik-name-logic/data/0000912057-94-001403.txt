FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- --------------------
Tues., Apr. 19, 1994

WELLS FARGO REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $202 MILLION;
PER SHARE EARNINGS $3.41 VS. $1.72 A YEAR AGO

Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) today reported net income of $202 million
for the first quarter of 1994, compared with $108 million for the first quarter
of 1993, an increase of 87 percent. Per share earnings for the first quarter of
1994 were $3.41, compared with $1.72 in the first quarter of 1993. First
quarter 1994 results were higher than a year ago, primarily due to a lower loan
loss provision.

Return on average assets (ROA) was 1.60 percent and return on average
common equity (ROE) was 21.09 percent in the first quarter of 1994. In the
year-ago period, ROA was .86 percent and ROE was 12.10 percent.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $642 million in the
first quarter of 1994, a decline of 5 percent from $679 million a year ago.
This decline resulted from both a lower average loan balance and a lower net
interest margin.

The company's net interest margin for the first quarter of 1994 was
5.56 percent, down from 5.90 percent in the same quarter of 1993. The decrease
was primarily due to lower yields on earning assets. However, loan balances
rose by 1 percent, to $33.452 billion, between December 31, 1993 and March 31,
1994. This is the first quarterly increase in loan balances since 1990.

"We are encouraged by the new business activity and strong profitability
we've seen during the past three months," said Carl E. Reichardt, chairman.
"The California economy seems to be stabilizing and we have seen increased loan
demand in the first quarter."

Noninterest income in the first quarter of 1994 was $300 million,
compared with $259 million in the same quarter of 1993, an increase of 16
percent. A significant portion of this increase was due to a $17 million growth
in service charges on deposit accounts.

Noninterest expense in the first quarter of 1994 was $523 million, down
3 percent from $539 million in the same quarter of 1993. The decrease
primarily resulted from a decline in foreclosed assets expense.

The provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 1994 was $60
million, compared with $210 million in the first quarter of 1993. Continued
improvement in the company's loan portfolio resulted in the reduction of the
provision.

Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 1994 totaled $61 million, or
.74 percent of average total loans (annualized). The largest category of net
charge-offs was credit card loans ($35 million). For the first quarter of 1993,
net charge-offs totaled $155 million, or 1.75 percent of average total loans
(annualized). The largest categories of net charge-offs were real estate
mortgage loans other than 1-4 family ($58 million), credit card loans ($42
million) and real estate construction loans ($24 million).

At March 31, 1994, the allowance for loan losses equaled 6.34 percent of
total loans, compared with 6.41 percent at December 31, 1993 and 6.04 percent
at March 31, 1993.

At March 31, 1994, total nonaccrual and restructured loans decreased to
$900 million (2.7 percent of total loans), of which an estimated 41 percent were
current as to payment of principal and interest. This compares with $1.200
billion (3.6 percent of total loans) at December 31, 1993, of which an estimated
50 percent were current, and $1.974 billion (5.6 percent of total loans) at
March 31, 1993, of which an estimated 52 percent were current. The estimated
average cash yield on the average nonaccrual loans outstanding in the first
quarter of 1994 was 8.5 percent, 9.0 percent last quarter and 6.9 percent in the
first quarter of 1993. Foreclosed assets were $354 million at March 31, 1994,
compared with $348 million at December 31, 1993 and $510 million at March 31,
1993.

At March 31, 1994, the company's preliminary risk-based capital ratios
were 14.85 percent for total risk-based capital and 10.25 percent for Tier 1
risk-based capital, exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines of 8 percent and
4 percent, respectively. At December 31, 1993, these risk-based capital ratios
were 15.12 percent and 10.48 percent, respectively. The decrease in total and
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios between December 31, 1993 and March 31, 1994
resulted primarily from the redemption of $150 million in Series A preferred
stock (at its liquidation preference carrying amount) on March 21, 1994 and
secondarily from the repurchase of 555,853 shares of common stock during the
quarter. At March 31, 1993, the company's total risk-based capital ratio was
13.67 percent and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 8.78 percent. The
ratio of common equity to total assets at March 31, 1994 was 7.09 percent,
compared with 7.00 percent at December 31, 1993 and 6.37 percent at March 31,
1993.

(1) There can be no assurance that individual borrowers will continue to perform at the level indicated or
that the performance characteristics will not change significantly. The March 31, 1994 amounts are
preliminary.
(2) Contractually past due is defined as a borrower whose loan principal or interest payment is 30 days or
more past due.
(3) Borrower has made no payments since being placed on nonaccrual.
(4) Borrower has made some payments since being placed on nonaccrual. Approximately $283 million and
$314 million of these loans had some payments made on them during the first quarter of 1994 and the
fourth quarter of 1993, respectively.
(5) Contractually current is defined as a loan for which principal and interest are being paid in
accordance with the terms of the loan. Approximately $52 million and $113 million of loans, both
current and past due, were placed on nonaccrual in the first quarter of 1994 and the fourth quarter of
1993, respectively, of which approximately $2 million and $15 million were contractually current at
March 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993, respectively. All of the contractually current loans were
placed on nonaccrual due to uncertainty of receiving full timely collection of interest or principal.
(6) Cumulative amounts recorded since inception of the loan.
(7) Includes only those interest payments received subsequent to a borrower being placed on nonaccrual.
Therefore, these amounts do not include interest received before these loans were placed on nonaccrual.
There were no interest payments received that were recorded as recoveries on partially charged-off
loans because payments on such loans were applied as a reduction of loan principal or recognized as
interest income.
