Item 5. Other Events.

The following is the text of a press release issued by Deere & Company
October 12,
1994.

MOLINE, ILLINOIS -- Deere & Company announced that negotiations for a new labor
agreement between the Company and the United Auto Workers (UAW) have been
suspended without the two parties having reached a settlement agreement.

"Representatives from Deere and the UAW have worked for a number of months
trying to reach agreement on a new labor contract," according to Robert Combs,
the
company's director of corporate communications. "To the company's
disappointment, our efforts to reach agreement have ended without success. 
Deere
is committed to the process of collective bargaining. At present, however, the
negotiations are deadlocked.

"To further the long-term position of the Company, we know it is essential to 
treat
employees fairly," Combs said. "Equally importantly, as we've stressed to 
the UAW's
leadership during these negotiations, our employment practices must recognize 
the
realities of our intensely competitive markets and lay a foundation for 
long-term
success in the marketplace.

"During our discussions with the UAW, Deere has developed and presented a
comprehensive proposal that would preserve and enhance for our current UAW-
represented workforce their outstanding wage and benefit package, a 
compensation
package which is the very best in our industries," Combs said. 
"Our proposal for an
agreement would also enhance the Company's long-term competitiveness.

"While we regret the lack of success in reaching a new labor agreement, the
Company expects to maintain normal operations," Combs said.

Combs noted that the Company is willing to resume meeting with UAW
representatives at any time if there is an indication that new discussions 
would be
fruitful.
