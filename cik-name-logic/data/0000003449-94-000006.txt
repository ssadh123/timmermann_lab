Item 5. Other Events.

A. On April 18, 1994, Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. (the "Company") 
issued the following press release:

A&A EXPECTS 1ST QUARTER NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.15 PER SHARE
BUT ANTICIPATES FULL YEAR 1994 TO BE PROFITABLE

NEW YORK, April 18 -- Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. (NYSE: AAL) today
announced that it expects to report a net loss per share of approximately 
$0.15 for the first quarter ended March 31, 1994. The company anticipates a 
net profit from continuing operations for the full year.

A&A said the first quarter results were caused primarily by lower-than-expected
revenues in its North American risk management and insurance services 
operations.

Robert E. Boni, chairman of the Board of Directors, noted, "This 
underperformance largely reflects the effect of management changes in the U.S. 
and management's acceleration of the pace of business segmentation. These 
changes have had a short-term impact on revenues."

He added, "I believe business segmentation and our other initiatives will 
provide substantial long-term benefits for our clients and shareholders as 
well as A&A."

A&A's human resource management subsidiary, the Alexander Consulting Group, also
anticipates a loss for the quarter, in part because of highly competitive 
market conditions.

The expected net loss for the quarter also includes an after-tax charge of 
approximately $2.7 million, or $0.06 per share, for the adoption of 
SFAS No. 112 regarding accounting for post-employment benefits.

Dr. Boni said, "A&A's results for the full quarter are not acceptable. 
However, I believe both ACG and our North American risk management and 
insurance services operations will have improved performance in the months 
ahead. I am particularly pleased with recent successes in winning major 
new corporate accounts."

Complete financial results for the quarter will be announced later this month.

A&A Services Inc. is a global organization of professional advisers providing
risk management, insurance brokerage and human resource management consulting
services from offices in more than 80 countries.

B. In addition, effective April 1, 1994, T.H. Irvin, chief executive 
officer of the Company, retired. Mr. Irvin will continue to serve as a 
director of the Company until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held 
on May 19, 1994. The position of chief executive officer will remain vacant
until the board of directors completes its search for a successor. In 
January, the Company announced Mr. Irvin's intention to retire and that it had 
commenced an international search for his successor.
