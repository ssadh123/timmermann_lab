INTERNATIONAL PAPER REPORTS IMPROVED 
1993 FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS

For Immediate Release
- ---------------------
Tuesday, January 11, 1994

PURCHASE, N.Y. - International Paper today reported l993
fourth-quarter earnings above the l992 fourth-quarter as well as
above the prior three quarters of l993. 

Net earnings in the l993 fourth-quarter were $100 million or
$.8l per share, l5 percent above the l992 fourth-quarter earnings
before special charges of $87 million or $.7l per share.

Fourth-quarter sales in l993 were $3.4 billion, level with
sales of the same period a year earlier.

John A. Georges, chairman and chief executive officer, said, 
"The improved earnings in the fourth-quarter are the result of
strong performances of our forest products and specialty products
businesses, and productivity improvements throughout the company. 
Our results continue to be negatively impacted, however, by weak
worldwide price levels in most printing paper and packaging
products."

Excluding special items in both full years, l993 earnings were
$3l4 million or $2.54 per share compared to l992 earnings of $405
million or $3.34 per share. Sales in l993 were $l3.7 billion, even
with l992 sales.

The printing papers business showed slight improvement in the
fourth-quarter over the third, despite continuing weak pulp and
paper prices and soft demand in Europe.

Packaging results in the quarter were essentially flat
compared to the third-quarter, however export markets showed a
slight upturn.
