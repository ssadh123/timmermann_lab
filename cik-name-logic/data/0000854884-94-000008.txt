CHICAGO AND NORTH WESTERN HOLDINGS CORP.
REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

Chicago, Illinois, April 28, 1994 -- Chicago and North Western Holdings Corp.
(NYSE: CNW) reported first quarter 1994 net income of $16.0 million, or 35
cents per share, compared with $14.6 million, or 33 cents per share, last
year.
This year's results were achieved despite severe winter weather and
reflect a net accounting adjustment that reduced net income by $1.7 million,
or 4 cents per share ($2.7 million pre-tax). The company announced last week
it expected an adjustment, resulting from errors and irregularities, that
would reduce net income by $800,000, or 2 cents per share. An additional
error discovered after last week's announcement increased the adjustment by
$900,000, or an additional 2 cents per share. The aggregate 4 cents per share
accounting adjustment is not material to the company's financial position or
results of operations, and will not result in a restatement of its past
financial statements. The company also noted that there is no evidence that
any funds or other assets were improperly diverted from the company. The
company is cooperating with a preliminary inquiry by the Securities and
Exchange Commission to determine whether there have been any violations of the
federal securities laws.<PAGE>
Operating revenues increased 8 percent to $273.9 million from $254.7
million. Operating expenses also increased 8 percent to $225.7 million from
$209.1 million, reflecting a 10 percent increase in volume as well as $3
million to $4 million in higher-than-expected costs attributable to the severe
weather experienced in January and February. First quarter operating income
increased 6 percent to $48.2 million compared to $45.6 million last year.
The Chicago and North Western's volumes grew 10 percent as the number of
loads handled in 1994 reached a first quarter record of 610,535. Western coal
loads increased 28 percent while coal loads on the core railroad improved 18
percent. Metallic ore shipments were up 20 percent, and shipments of motor
vehicles increased 10 percent. Intermodal traffic improved 4 percent as both
double-stack and piggyback shipments grew. Shipments of raw grains and
finished grain products were down 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively, due
to poor crop availability and weather-related service problems.
The 1994 first quarter accounting adjustment is required as a result of
a total net overstatement of $2.2 million (5 cents per share) in 1993 fourth
quarter reported net income of $24.5 million (54 cents per share) and a total
net overstatement of $1.7 million (3 cents per share) in 1993 full year
reported net income before extraordinary items of $64.0 million ($1.44 per
share). As previously announced, the company also identified errors and
irregularities in the earlier quarters in 1993 and in the years 1992 and 1991
that were de minimis.
Chicago and North Western Holdings Corp. is the holding company for the
Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, a leading railroad freight
hauler in the central transcontinental corridor and major transporter of coal,
grain and double-stack containers. 
A first quarter statement of operations is attached.<PAGE>

This year's results were achieved despite severe winter weather and reflect a
net accounting adjustment of $1.7 million, or 4 cents per share ($2.7 million
pre-tax), resulting from previously announced errors and irregularities that
reduced net income by $800,000, or 2 cents per share ($1.3 million pre-tax)
and from an additional error discovered after last week's announcement that
further reduced net income by $900,000, or an additional 2 cents per share
($1.4 million pre-tax). The additional error reflected in the 1994 first
quarter accounting adjustment had increased 1993 fourth quarter net income by
$1.2 million, or 3 cents per share. Together with the previously reported 2
cents per share 1994 first quarter accounting adjustment, this resulted in a
total net overstatement of $2.2 million (5 cents per share) in 1993 fourth
quarter reported net income of $24.5 million, or 54 cents per share (a total
overstatement of $3.6 million pre-tax). The total net overstatement for the
1993 fiscal year (including the previously announced amount) was $1.7 million
(3 cents per share) on 1993 reported income before extraordinary items of
$64.0 million, or $1.44 per share (an overstatement of $2.7 million pre-tax). 
As previously announced, the company has also identified errors and
irregularities in the earlier quarters in 1993 and in 1992 and 1991 that were
de minimis.<PAGE>
