FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FORT LEE, NEW JERSEY, JANUARY 14, 1994 . . . The Cooper Companies, Inc.
(NYSE:COO)(the 'Company') announced today that a verdict had been reached in the
trial with respect to the charges in the federal criminal indictment against the
Company and Gary Singer, a former Co-Chairman of the Company, relating to, among
other things, an alleged securities 'trading scheme.' Mr. Singer was found
guilty on 21 counts, including racketeering, conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud,
money laundering and aiding and abetting violations by an investment advisor.
The Company was found guilty on seven counts of mail fraud and wire fraud
related to Mr. Singer's conduct, but acquitted of conspiracy and aiding
and abetting charges.

Sentencing is expected to occur on March 25, 1994. The maximum penalty
which could be imposed on the Company is the greatest of $500,000 per count,
twice the gross gain derived from each count or twice the gross loss suffered by
the victim of each count. In addition to penalties, the court could impose a
fine equal to restitution.

The Company, Gary Singer and Steven Singer, the Company's Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer, face various related charges contained in
a civil complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
