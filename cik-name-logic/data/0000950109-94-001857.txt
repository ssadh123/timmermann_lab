Item 1. Changes in Control of the Registrant
------------------------------------

The Registrant believes that a Change in Control has not occurred.
However, see Item 2 of this Form 8-K regarding a substantial change in ownership
of the common stock of the Company that has occurred in conjunction with the
acquisition reported herein.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
------------------------------------

Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company, together with its subsidiary Brown &
Sharpe International Capital Corporation, acquired on September 28, 1994, the
stock of DEA S.p.A., an Italian corporation and its related metrology business
from Finmeccanica S.p.A., an Italian corporation. The business of DEA S.p.A.
and its subsidiaries ("DEA") is headquartered in Turin, Italy.

The purchase was pursuant to the provisions of the Acquisition Agreement
dated as of June 10, 1994 between the Company and Finmeccanica S.p.A., as
amended by Amendment dated July 31, 1994 (the "DEA Acquisition Agreement"),
copies of which are filed as exhibits to this Report.

The purchase price paid by Brown & Sharpe was the delivery to Finmeccanica
S.p.A. at the Closing of 3,450,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of Brown &
Sharpe. In addition, the DEA Acquisition Agreement provides for a post-closing
purchase price adjustment pursuant to which additional shares of Class A Common
Stock of Brown & Sharpe may, under the specified circumstances, be required to
be delivered to Finmeccanica S.p.A. The purchase price was determined through
negotiation by the parties. The terms of the post-closing purchase price
adjustment provisions are based on a comparison of adjusted net asset value (as
defined in the DEA Acquisition Agreement) of DEA as of June 30, 1993 and
adjusted net asset value of DEA as of the Pricing Date (as defined and
calculated in accordance with a formula in the DEA Acquisition Agreement) and
after taking into account the reduction of net assets as of the Pricing Date by
virtue of the non-recourse factoring of a mutually agreed amount of receivables
of DEA prior to the Pricing Date (and after reflecting an additional adjustment
relating to any difference between the estimated Pricing Date amount of
indebtedness of DEA to be discharged by Finmeccanica and the actual amount, as
finally determined, of such indebtedness as of the Pricing Date). If the post-
closing adjustment indicates an increase or a decrease in the purchase price,
then either the Combined Company (the term the "Combined Company" refers to
Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company and (unless the context otherwise requires)
its consolidated subsidiaries (including DEA) after giving effect to the DEA
Acquisition) will issue to Finmeccanica an additional number of shares of Class
A Common Stock with a value equal to such positive difference or Finmeccanica
will make a cash payment to the Combined Company, equal to such negative
difference. However, if such positive or negative difference is less than
$500,000, no adjustment will be made. The amount of any purchase price
adjustment will be conclusively determined, subsequent to the closing date of
the DEA Acquisition, based upon the specified calculations and the audited
combined balance sheet as of the Pricing Date of DEA and its subsidiaries as
determined under the procedures set forth in the DEA Acquisition Agreement. The
DEA Acquisition Agreement also provided that prior to the closing Finmeccanica
was required to assume or discharge all indebtedness for borrowed money of DEA
other than an amount of indebtedness net of cash in excess of L0.8 billion, to
remain outstanding on the closing, which amount is determined as of July 31,
1994 (the "Pricing Date") pursuant to a formula in the DEA Acquisition
Agreement. Brown & Sharpe estimates that approximately $13.8 million aggregate
principal amount of DEA indebtedness will remain outstanding at the closing.

Immediately after the DEA Acquisition (prior to the post-closing
adjustment, if any, for the DEA Acquisition purchase price), various members of
the Sharpe family, including Henry D. Sharpe, Jr. and Henry D. Sharpe, III (each
of whom is a director of the Company), held approximately 483,966 shares of
Class A Common Stock and approximately 161,320 shares of Class B Common Stock,
representing approximately 7.5% of the outstanding aggregate equity in the
Combined Company and approximately 15.5% of the combined voting power of the
Combined Company's outstanding common stock, and Finmeccanica held 3,450,000
shares of Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 39.9% of the
outstanding aggregate equity of the Combined Company and approximately 25.5% of
the combined 

1
<PAGE>

voting power of the Combined Company's outstanding common stock. In addition,
approximately 446,883 shares of Class A Common Stock and approximately 247,139
shares of Class B Common Stock were held for the employee benefit plan
participants under various employee benefit plans maintained by Brown & Sharpe
and its subsidiaries. Finmeccanica has the right to designate three nominees for
election to the Combined Company's Board of Directors (which will be increased
from seven to ten directors) and has certain rights and obligations with respect
to the election of directors, as provided in the Shareholder Agreement (and
described below).

The acquired assets represent the assets of DEA used in the manufacturing
and marketing of high precision coordinate measuring machines ("CMMs") and
related accessories, software and services. These assets include the CMM
manufacturing facilities in Italy, the sales and distribution facilities outside
Italy (all such facilities being leased) and the receivables, inventories and
other assets used in the CMM business. The Company intends to use the acquired
assets to engage in the worldwide CMM business, complementing the Brown & Sharpe
worldwide CMM business.

DEA, a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and marketing of high
precision CMMs and related accessories, software and services, derives over half
of its revenues from medium-to-large vertical and horizontal-arm CMMs used
principally in automotive and aerospace end markets and also derives a
significant portion of its revenues through the sale of upgrades, enhancements,
replacement parts and services. The Company believes that DEA's large vertical
and horizontal CMM products, as well as DEA's distribution capabilities in
Europe, South America, the Middle East, India and China, will complement and
strengthen the Company's CMM product line and distribution network.

In connection with the DEA Acquisition, Brown & Sharpe and Finmeccanica
entered into a Shareholders Agreement dated September 28, 1994 (the
"Shareholders Agreement") providing Finmeccanica with certain rights and
obligations with respect to its ownership of shares in the Combined Company.
Finmeccanica is prohibited from acquiring any shares of the Combined Company's
stock if such acquisition will increase Finmeccanica's ownership above
approximately 40% on a fully-diluted basis (as defined in the Shareholders
Agreement) until December 31, 1998, or earlier upon the happening of certain
specified events. The Shareholders Agreement provides preemptive rights to
Finmeccanica so long as it owns at least 862,500 shares of the Combined
Company's Class A Common Stock, such that the Combined Company may not issue any
shares of its Class A Common Stock or equity securities exercisable,
exchangeable or convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock ("Derivative
Securities") to any third party, other than certain specified exclusions
(including shares issued on conversion of the Combined Company's 9 1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2005 and up to 400,000 shares issuable
upon the exercise of stock options granted to employees under the Combined
Company's benefit plans), without first offering to Finmeccanica the right to
purchase that percentage of the Combined Company's equity securities such that
Finmeccanica's percentage ownership of the Combined Company's common stock on a
fully diluted basis (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement) remains constant.
In addition, Finmeccanica will not sell any of the Combined Company's equity
securities to any third party until the expiration of two years after the
closing of the DEA Acquisition, and upon the expiration of such two-year period,
may sell securities to a third party only after offering the Combined Company
the opportunity to purchase such shares (other than sales pursuant to a
registered public offering pursuant to Finmeccanica's registration rights and
sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933).

The Shareholders Agreement also provides that the Combined Company will
increase the number of its directors from seven to ten and will use reasonable
best efforts to cause to be elected to the board of directors three nominees
designated by Finmeccanica for respective terms expiring at the 1995, 1996, and
1997 annual meetings of stockholders. At such time as Henry D. Sharpe, Jr.
ceases to be a director of the Combined Company, Finmeccanica will thereafter be
entitled to only a total of two nominees on the board plus a third nominee, who
may not be an employee of Finmeccanica but shall be an experienced executive or
advisor to industrial businesses, selected by Finmeccanica subject to approval
by the board of directors of the Combined Company, that may not be unreasonably
withheld. In any event, Finmeccanica shall be entitled to two nominees on the
board of directors while it owns at least 1,250,000 shares of the Combined
Company's Class A Common Stock and one nominee on the board of 

2
<PAGE>

directors while it owns at least 375,000 shares of the Combined Company's Class
A Common Stock. Under the terms of a letter agreement between Henry D. Sharpe,
Jr. and Finmeccanica, Henry D. Sharpe, Jr. agreed to vote all shares of the
Combined Company's stock as to which he has sole voting power in favor of the
Finmeccanica nominees on the Combined Company's board of directors. The
Shareholders Agreement provides that Finmeccanica will vote its shares of Class
A Common Stock in favor of the election as directors of the Combined Company of
all the nominees selected by the Combined Company's board of directors.

The DEA Acquisition Agreement provides that for a period of five years
after the closing date of the DEA Acquisition, neither Finmeccanica nor any of
its affiliates will directly or indirectly acquire more than a 20% ownership
interest in any business, venture or activity which competes with the metrology
business relating to CMMs (including parts and accessories) being conducted or
proposed to be conducted by DEA at the closing date of the DEA Acquisition or
relating to metrology products performing functions similar to those of the
products manufactured and sold by DEA. These noncompetition provisions will
terminate if Brown & Sharpe no longer owns a greater than 50% ownership interest
in DEA. Finmeccanica will not be in breach of the noncompetition provision of
the DEA Acquisition Agreement if it or any of its affiliates acquires or invests
in any company which includes among its business operations the manufacture and
sale of metrology products performing functions similar to those of the products
manufactured and sold by DEA to the extent that sales of such products
constitute only an immaterial portion of the total revenues of the acquired
business. In the DEA Acquisition Agreement, Finmeccanica represents to Brown &
Sharpe that it has no present intention of acquiring any such company.

The DEA Acquisition Agreement also provides that for a period of three
years after the closing date of the DEA Acquisition Finmeccanica will not,
without the prior written consent of Brown & Sharpe, employ any person who is an
employee of Brown & Sharpe (including DEA and its subsidiaries) or any
subsidiary, group or division of Brown & Sharpe (including DEA and its
subsidiaries) unless such person has been terminated by DEA or its subsidiaries.

The DEA Acquisition Agreement provides that Brown & Sharpe and Finmeccanica
will, for the periods specified in the DEA Acquisition Agreement, none of which
are shorter than 21 months after the closing of the DEA Acquisition, indemnify
each other against up to $10.0 million (less the first $500,000) resulting from
the inaccuracy of representations and warranties cover matters relating to the
respective business, financial statements, material contracts, compliance with
law and other items customary in transactions of this type), breach of
nonfulfillment of any agreement of covenant contained in or required to be
entered into in connection with the DEA Acquisition Agreement, and certain
environmental and tax claims, if any. Finmeccanica will also indemnify Brown &
Sharpe for the amount by which certain of the liabilities of DEA exceeds limits
provided for in the purchase price provisions of the DEA Acquisition Agreement.

The above description of certain terms of the DEA Acquisition Agreement and
certain terms of the Shareholders Agreement does not summarize all the terms of
such Agreements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
thereof, copies of which are included as Exhibits 1, 1.1 and 2 to this Report
and incorporated by reference herein.

Item 5. Other Events
------------

As of September 28, 1994, the date of purchase of DEA reported in Item 2 of
this Form 8-K, the Registrant has completed material changes in its debt
structure.

In conjunction with the DEA acquisition, Brown & Sharpe completed new long-
term and short-term financing arrangements including: closing on a $8.5
million, 5 year term - 10 year amortization, mortgage secured by Brown &
Sharpe's facility in North Kingstown, Rhode Island; obtaining $25 million of
three-year term loans with $6.7 million borrowed from San Paolo Bank and $18.3
million borrowed from Banca Commerciale Italiana, both loans having interest as
periodically selected by Brown & Sharpe 

3
<PAGE>

at the rate of libor plus 0.6% or prime for each of the banks, and both of which
loans are guaranteed by Finmeccanica S.p.A.; and restructured the Foothill
Capital Corporation $15 million secured revolving credit facility, increasing it
to $25 million with a termination date of September 30, 1997 and providing for
the pledge of additional collateral, namely 65% of the shares of stock of DEA
and also the accounts receivables, inventories and certain other assets of the
United States subsidiary of DEA S.p.A. As of October 1, 1994 there were no
borrowings outstanding under the Foothill Capital Corporation secured revolving
credit facility (borrowings thereunder as of September 28, 1994 were repaid by
the Company).

Brown & Sharpe has received letters of assurance from five of the Italian
banks providing the existing DEA Lines of Credit with respect to their
maintenance of such lines, totaling approximately the equivalent of $10 million,
for DEA S.p.A. In addition, Brown & Sharpe is in discussions with several other
banks currently providing DEA Lines of Credit, and expects that the DEA S.p.A.
Lines of Credit that will be available will be at least $15 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholder and
Board of Directors of
DEA S.p.A.

We have audited the accompanying combined statements of operations, cash
flows and changes in divisional deficit of the DEA Metrology Activities of
Finmeccanica, as described in Note 1, for the year ended December 31, 1991.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the DEA S.p.A. management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the combined
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined results of operations and cash
flows of the DEA Metrology Activities of Finmeccanica for the year ended
December 31, 1991 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

October 5, 1993
Toledo, Ohio

To the Board of Directors of
Elsag Bailey, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of division assets, liabilities
and equity (deficit) and the related statements of operations and accumulated
deficit and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Digital Electronic Automation, a division of Elsag
Bailey, Inc., at December 31, 1992, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management
of Elsag Bailey, Inc. and Digital Electronic Automation; our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made be management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Digital Electronic Automation is a division of Elsag Bailey, Inc., which is a
member of a group of affiliated companies and, as disclosed in the financial
statements, has extensive transactions and relationships with members of the
group. Because of these relationships, it is possible that the terms of these
transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions
among wholly unrelated parties.

As described in Note 7, Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company has entered into
a non-binding letter of intent to purchase certain net assets of Finmeccanica's
DEA Group, of which Digital Electronic Automation is a part.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
DEA S.p.A.

We have audited the combined balance sheets of the DEA Metrology Activities
of Finmeccanica as described in Note 1, as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the related combined statements of operations, divisional deficit and cash
flows for the years then ended. These combined financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of DEA S.p.A. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these combined financial statements based on our audit. We did
not audit the financial statements of Digital Electronic Automation (U.S.A.), a
division of Elsag Bailey Inc., for the year ended December 31, 1992 which
statements reflect total assets of Lire 28,525 million and total revenues of
Lire 30,990 million for the year then ended. Those statements were audited by
other auditors, whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar
as it relates to the amounts included for Digital Electronic Automation
(U.S.A.), a division of Elsag Bailey Inc., at December 31, 1992 is based solely
on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the combined
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall combined financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audit and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

As more fully described in Note 5, the DEA Metrology Activities is one of
many divisions of Finmeccanica S.p.A. and its subsidiaries and has material
transactions with the affiliated companies of IRI, an Italian State holding
company which has a controlling interest in Finmeccanica S.p.A.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors on
the December 31, 1992 financial statements, the combined financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined
financial position of the DEA Metrology Activities of Finmeccanica, as
described in Note 1, at December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the combined results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 19 to the combined financial statements, the DEA
Metrology Activities of Finmeccanica has a history of recurring losses from
operations and a net asset deficiency which raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern without the continued financial support
of Finmeccanica S.p.A. Management's plans as to these matters are also
described in Note 19. The combined financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(ITALIAN LIRE IN MILLIONS; U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization

The DEA Metrology Activities of Finmeccanica (the"Division") design and
manufacture at its Italian headquarters a diversified line of Metrology
Products (precision dimensional measuring systems and instruments). The
products are marketed worldwide direct from Italy and through its five overseas
operations which also provide technical assistance, sales support and other
related services.

The Division is one of many divisions of Finmeccanica S.p.A., a company which
is incorporated in Italy and wholly owned by an Italian government entity. At
June 30, 1994,the Division was comprised of DEA S.p.A. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries which are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
DEA Iberica S.A. ................................... Spain
DEA Digital Electronic Automation Vetriebs GmbH..... Germany
DEA Kabushiki Kaisha................................ Japan
Digital Electronic Automation Company............... United States of America
DEA France S.A...................................... France
</TABLE>

The following re-organizations occurred in the structure of the Division
during the six months ended June 30, 1994 and the years ended December 31, 1993
and 1992.

DIGITAL ELECTRONIC AUTOMATION COMPANY

Digital Electronic Automation Company was originally incorporated in the
United States as Digital Electronic Automation Inc., a fully owned subsidiary
of the DEA Metrology Activities of Finmeccanica. On November 22, 1991,
following a corporate reorganization, it was sold to an affiliated company,
Bailey Controls Inc., which itself was merged into Elsag Bailey Inc.
Subsequently, Digital Electronic Automation became a trading division of Elsag
Bailey Inc. with its common stock, paid in and contribution capital being
recharacterized as Divisional equity.

On October 31, 1993 Elsag Bailey Inc. eliminated the net asset deficiency of
the division by waiving part of a working capital advance made to the division.
The remaining outstanding balance on the advance was repaid. On the following
day, the net assets of the Division were sold to Digital Electronic Automation
Company, a fully owned subsidiary of DEA S.p.A. at their net book value of
zero.

The combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993
incorporates the results of Digital Electronic Automation for the whole year as
both the Division and the Company formed part of the DEA Metrology Activities
of Finmeccanica during 1993.

DEA FRANCE S.A.

The combined financial statements for the years ending December 31, 1993 and
1992 include the results and operations of the Metrology Division of DEA France
S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of Finmeccanica S.p.A., which was incorporated
into the combined financial statements from January 1, 1992.

On January 1, 1994 the non-metrology activities of DEA France S.A. were
transferred to another Finmeccanica group company. On the same day, the
shareholders' capital of DEA France S.A. was acquired by DEA S.p.A. for a
consideration representing the net asset value of the Company at December 31,
1993.

The net divisional equity of the Metrology Division of DEA France S.A.
included in the combined financial statements at December 31, 1993 and 1992 has
been eliminated from the combined financial statements at June 30, 1994 on
consolidation.

(ITALIAN LIRE IN MILLIONS; U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

At December 31, 1992 DEA S.p.A. had two separate business divisions as
follows:

Metrology division--Design, manufacture and distribution of high precision
measuring instruments

Assembly division--Design and manufacture of assembly machines and robots.

On January 19, 1993 the net assets attributable to the assembly division of
DEA S.p.A. at December 31, 1992 were transferred to "SAR--Sistemi di
Assemblaggio Robotizzato" (a subsidiary of Finmeccanica S.p.A.). No
consideration was paid by SAR for the net assets acquired as these had a net
value of zero. The combined financial statements for the years ended December
31, 1992 and prior thereto exclude the income, expenses, assets and liabilities
of the Assembly division as these did not form part of the DEA Metrology
Activities of Finmeccanica in those years.

Principles of combination

The combined financial statements of the DEA Metrology Activities of
Finmeccanica for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the six months
ended June 30, 1993 and 1994, include the results and operations of the
following:

(ITALIAN LIRE IN MILLIONS; U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

Interim consolidated financial statements

The consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 1993
and June 30, 1994 and the related notes are unaudited and in the opinion of
management, include all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of these periods.
The results for the six months ended June 30, 1994 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.

Revenue recognition

Revenues and all costs (including costs of installation and training) of
standardized machines are recognized upon shipment to the customer.

In the exceptional case of large or long term projects, where machines may
require integration into complex manufacturing operations over an extended
period of time, revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method.
Under the percentage of completion method, revenue and gross profit are
recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs
incurred and the total estimated costs at completion. Revenues and gross
profits are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract
costs and contract revenues. Estimated losses are recorded when identified.

In addition, the Division earns revenue from the servicing of its equipment,
in certain instances under service contracts. Revenue under such contracts is
recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract.

Foreign currency transactions

Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and the
remeasurement of foreign currency balances and accounts denominated in foreign
currencies are included in the determination of net income in the period in
which they occur.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value, with cost
principally determined on an average basis. Cost is comprised of direct
materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.

An allowance is provided to account for slow moving and obsolete inventory.

Government grants

Government grants in respect of research and development projects and other
revenue items are recognized in the income statement when all the terms and
conditions of the grant have been met.

Property, plant, and equipment

All property, plant, and equipment is recorded at historical cost.

(ITALIAN LIRE IN MILLIONS; U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant,
and equipment on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the
assets concerned. The principal rates used for this purpose are:

On December 18, 1992, the share capital of DEA S.p.A. was increased to Lire

S.p.A. In addition, Finmeccanica S.p.A. contributed a further Lire 16,700 as
additional paid in capital, of which Lire 15,247 related to the Metrology
Division of DEA S.p.A. These transactions were made in order to comply with the
minimum capital requirement stipulated by Italian company law.

The whole of the share capital of DEA S.p.A., consisting of 16,300,000 shares
with a nominal value of 1,000 Italian Lire, is owned by Finmeccanica S.p.A.

The divisional equity balance at December 31, 1992 is comprised of Lire
13,145 representing the common stock, paid in and contribution capital of
Digital Electronic Automation Inc. at the date it was converted into a trading
division of Elsag Bailey Inc. On October 31, 1993 the net asset deficiency
(Divisional equity and accumulated deficit) was eliminated by means of a loan
waiver from Elsag Bailey Inc. Subsequently, on November 1, 1993 the net assets
of the division were sold at their net book value of zero to DEA S.p.A. Lire
4,993 representing the divisional capital of the Metrology Division of DEA
France S.A. following its inclusion into the combined financial statements from
January 1, 1992. On January 1, 1994 the non-metrology activities of DEA France
S.A. were transferred to another Finmeccanica group entity and the
shareholders' capital of the Company acquired by DEA S.p.A. The divisional net
equity at December 31, 1993 was consequently eliminated on consolidation
against the carrying value of the investment in DEA S.p.A. at June 30, 1994.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
(ITALIAN LIRE IN MILLIONS; U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

On August 18, 1993, Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company (Brown & Sharpe)
announced that they had entered into a non-binding letter of intent to purchase
the assets of the Metrology Division of Finmeccanica S.p.A. at June 30, 1993
with the exception of certain agreed upon exclusions and adjustments. In return
for the disposal, Finmeccanica S.p.A. would receive 2.5 million shares of Class
A Brown & Sharpe common stock and a contingent non-assignable right to obtain a
further 950,000 shares of Class A Brown & Sharpe common stock. Such right would
be exercisable only if during the five year period following the closing date
of the transaction, the closing share price of Brown & Sharpe common stock
equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for thirty non-consecutive business days
over any twelve month period of time. At the date of this report, the
transaction has not yet been completed.

NOTE 18--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases certain property and equipment under non-cancelable
operating leases that expire in various years through to 2002. The property
leases may be renewed upon expiry of the original term.

Future minimum payments under operating leases with initial or unexpired
terms of one year or more consisted of the following:

The total rental expense in respect of operating leases for the year ending
December 31, 1993 was Lire 7,300 ($4,603) (Lire 5,524 and Lire 4,224 for 1992
and 1991, respectively).

NOTE 19--GOING CONCERN

The Division has incurred substantial losses in recent years (1991: Lire
18,326, 1992: Lire 24,233, 1993: Lire 3,860 ($2,434)) and at June 30, 1994 had
a net asset deficiency of Lire 15,168 ($9,564).

The ability of the Division to operate as a going concern has been dependent
on the financial support of its parent company, Finmeccanica S.p.A.

Under the terms of the non-binding letter of intent, described in Note 17
above, Brown & Sharpe is to assume existing debt of the DEA Metrology
Activities of Finmeccanica up to the amount of $15 million. The ability of the
Division to operate as a going concern is dependent upon the continuing
financial support of its future owners and a return to profitable operations.
Management forecasts this will occur in the foreseeable future as a result of
the restructuring which has taken place and the completion of the contemplated
transaction with Brown & Sharpe, which will substantially reduce the Division's
borrowing needs.

NOTE 20--OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES)

The 1991 net other income of Lire 10,688 includes a gain of Lire 11,618 that
arose on the disposal of the factory premises at Moncalieri to an affiliated
company following the reorganization of the divisions

(ITALIAN LIRE IN MILLIONS; U.S. DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

operations in that year. No taxation was incurred on this transaction since the
gain was fully offset against trading losses incurred in that year.

NOTE 21--ACCUMULATED DEFICIT

The accumulated deficit at December 31, 1991 is stated net of the
recapitalization transactions made in order to comply with the minimum capital
requirements stipulated by Italian company law. Under these regulations, the
shareholders, in general meeting, elect to eliminate part of the accumulated
loss against issued share capital or additional capital injections.

PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements are unaudited and are
based on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Brown & Sharpe, the Combined
Financial Statements of DEA, the Financial Statements of Roch and the Financial
Statements of Mauser. Roch and Mauser were acquired by Brown & Sharpe on 
March 24, 1994, and were previously disclosed by Brown & Sharpe on Form 8-K 
dated May 13, 1994.

The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income (Loss) for the year
ended December 25, 1993 and for the six months ended July 2, 1994 have been
adjusted to give effect to the acquisition of Roch and Mauser (collectively the
"Roch Acquisition"), the acquisition of DEA (the "DEA Acquisition") and the New
Financing (4) (and the application of the proceeds therefrom) as if such
transactions had occurred on December 27, 1992. The unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Balance Sheet at July 2, 1994 has been adjusted to give effect to the
DEA Acquisition and the New Financing (and the application of the proceeds
therefrom) as if such transactions had occurred on that date. The pro forma
adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that
management of Brown & Sharpe believes are reasonable and that are described in
the notes to the Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements. The Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements do not purport to represent what the Combined
Company's financial position or results of operations would actually have been
if the transactions had occurred on the dates specified or to project the
Combined Company's financial position or results of operations for any future
period.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share amounts)

1. Basis of Presentation

The pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the purchase price for the DEA Acquisition will consist of 3,450,000 shares of
Class A Common Stock, having an aggregate value of $23,288 based on the August
16, 1994 closing price of $6.75 per share. The DEA Acquisition Agreement
provides that this purchase price will be subject to a post-closing adjustment
based on a comparison of adjusted net asset value (as defined in the DEA
Acquisition Agreement) of DEA as of June 30, 1993 and the adjusted net asset
value of DEA as of July 31, 1994 (the "Pricing Date") (as defined and calculated
in accordance with a formula in the DEA Acquisition Agreement) and after taking
into account the reduction of net assets as of the Pricing Date by virtue of the
non-recourse factoring of a mutually agreed amount of receivables of DEA prior
to the Pricing Date (and after reflecting an additional adjustment relating to
any difference between the estimated Pricing Date amount of indebtedness of DEA
to be discharged by Finmeccanica and the actual amount, as finally determined,
of such indebtedness as of the Pricing Date.)

The assumed purchase price has been allocated as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

<S> <C>
Cash.......................................................... $ 497
Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts.. 43,859
Inventories................................................... 36,745
Prepaid expenses and other current assets..................... 6,144
Notes payable and current installments of long-term debt...... (6,464)
Accounts payable.............................................. (14,868)
Accrued expenses and income taxes............................. (26,929)
Long-term debt................................................ (7,336)
Termination indemnities....................................... (7,920)
Excess of fair value over cost of assets acquired............. (440)
--------
TOTAL...................................................... $ 23,288
========
</TABLE>

The allocation of purchase price to cash reflects DEA's expected cash level as
of the closing under the DEA Acquisition Agreement. The pro forma combined
income statements are unaudited and present a combination of the historical net
sales of Brown & Sharpe, DEA, Roch and Mauser (after elimination of intercompany
sales), and do not reflect possible increases in net sales that may arise from
synergies related to the combination, or possible decreases in net sales as a
result of planned cost cutting measures, possible discontinuance of certain
similar products, customers' desires to maintain alternative sources of supply
or for other reasons.

For consistency of presentation, the historical information and related pro
forma adjustments for DEA, Roch and Mauser appearing in the pro forma combined
financial statements have been translated using the convenience translation
exchange rates of L1,586, FF5.81 and DM1.67 to $1.00, respectively. These
convenience translation exchange rates are not materially different from the
average exchange rates during the period of L1,563, FF5.67 and DM 1.66 to $1.00,
respectively for 1993, and L1,634, FF5.72 and DM1.68 to $1.00, respectively, for
the first six months of 1994.

The pro forma combined income statements reflect the effects of planned cost
savings as follows: for the year ended December 25, 1993, savings anticipated
from measures to be commenced within the first three months following the
applicable acquisition are reflected as if such measures were effective at the
beginning of the period presented; savings anticipated from measures to be
commenced in months 4 through 12 following the applicable acquisition are
reflected in the full year period in amounts equal to a fraction of the amounts

35
<PAGE>

that would be realized if the measures were effective at the beginning of the
year, such fraction being equal to the fraction of the year remaining after the
date by which the measures will be commenced (i.e., the anticipated cost savings
attributable to an action to be taken by the end of the ninth month would be
reflected in an amount equal to one-fourth of the amount that would be realized
if such action were effective at the beginning of the year); savings from
measures to be commenced in months 4 through 12 following the applicable
acquisition are reflected in the pro forma income statement for the six months
ended July 2, 1994 in amounts equal to one-half the amounts that would be
reflected in the pro forma income statement for the year ended. The pro forma
combined income statements do not reflect additional savings anticipated to be
realized from further cost savings measures planned to be commenced after 12
months following the applicable acquisition. The estimates of anticipated cost
savings included in the pro forma combined financial statements differ from the
cost savings included in Item 2 "Acquisition or Disposition of Assets" of this
filing on Form 8-K which are not limited to cost savings to be realized from
actions commenced within the first 12 months of combined operations and which do
not use the assumption in this Note 1 that savings from measures to be commenced
within the first three months of combined operations are reflected as if such
measures were effective at the beginning of the period.

The pro forma combined income statements do not include certain costs,
primarily professional fees, incurred in connection with the DEA Acquisition and
severance and other costs to be incurred in connection with anticipated
elimination of personnel, closure of facilities and other cost savings measures
following the Roch Acquisition and the DEA Acquisition. Brown & Sharpe
estimates that these costs will approximate $13,545, of which approximately
$1,999 will be reflected as restructuring expense in 1994, $11,546 will be
charged against reserves established in the allocations of purchase price
associated with these acquisitions and $160 will be incurred with respect to
capital spending associated with facilities consolidation.

2. Pro Forma Adjustments

The pro forma financial statements reflect the following:

a) Adjustment to eliminate intercompany sales made by Roch to Mauser of $518
for the six months ended July 2, 1994 and $2,214 for the year 1993.

b) Adjustment to reflect decreased design engineering as a result of expected
reductions in personnel of $532 for the six months ended July 2, 1994 and $1,065
for the year 1993, decreased purchasing costs of the combined operations of $38
for the six months ended July 2, 1994 and $75 for the year 1993, and the
elimination of intercompany purchases of Mauser from Roch of $518 for the six
months ended July 2, 1994 and $2,214 for the year 1993.

c) Adjustment to reflect expected decreased administrative, sales and
distribution expenses resulting from reductions in North American and European
administrative, sales and distribution personnel of $2,668 for the six months
ended July 2, 1994 and $5,336 for the year ended December 25, 1993 and closing
of overlapping facilities of $1,226 for the six months ended July 2, 1994 and
$2,452 for the year ended December 25, 1993.

d) Adjustment to reflect an elimination of depreciation of fixed assets and
goodwill related to the write-down of DEA assets in accordance with the purchase
method of accounting, and the amortization of debt issuance costs over four
years. The adjustment for the year ended December 25, 1993 is as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

<S> <C>
Depreciation of assets................................................. $ 790
Amortization of goodwill ($588 in 1994)................................ 1,193
Amortization of estimated expenses of the debt issuance costs ($2,108). (512)
------
$1,471
======
</TABLE>

This adjustment approximated $433 for the six months ended July 2, 1994.

36
<PAGE>

e) Adjustment to reflect the amortization of the excess of fair value of DEA's
assets over Brown & Sharpe's assumed cost to acquire such assets. The excess of
fair value of $440 will be amortized over a ten-year period. See Note 1.

f) Adjustment to reflect the decrease in interest expense resulting from the
completion of the New Financing, the assumption, discharge or waiver by
Finmeccanica of an assumed $66,532 principal amount of DEA debt in connection
with the DEA Acquisition and the repayment of certain Brown & Sharpe and DEA
debt with the proceeds of the New Financing, in each case based on amounts
outstanding and interest rates in effect at the beginning of the period,
calculated as follows:

The adjustment for interest for the year ended December 25, 1993, is
calculated as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

<S> <C>
Interest on $8,500 North Kingstown Mortgage at 8.75%................. $ 744
Interest on $25,000 Three-Year Guaranteed Term Loan at 4.24%......... 1,060
Interest on $16,000 debentures at 9.25%.............................. 1,480
Interest on $19,629 Mortgage Loans at 6.69% to 10.00%................ 1,558
Interest on $6,464 DEA long-term debt at 8.79%....................... 568

-------
5,625
Actual expense recorded.............................................. 11,855
-------
$ 6,230
=======
</TABLE>

Interest has been calculated for the pro forma combined financial statements
assuming no borrowings are made under the $25 Million Revolving Credit Facility
that is part of the New Financing.

This adjustment was $3,468 for the six months ended July 2, 1994.

g) Adjustment to eliminate nonrecurring income from debt forgiveness by Diehl,
the former owner of Mauser.

h) Adjusted to reflect the pro forma adjustments to income discussed above and
the issuance of 175,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in the Roch Acquisition
and the issuance of 3,450,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in the DEA
Acquisition, assuming in each case that no additional shares are issued in a
post-closing purchase price adjustment.

i) Adjustment to eliminate DEA cash retained by Finmeccanica and to reflect
the receipt of the gross proceeds of the New Financing and the application
thereof as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

<S> <C>
Gross proceeds from North Kingstown Mortgage............... $ 8,500
Gross proceeds from Three-Year Guaranteed Term Loan........ 25,000
Repayment of existing Brown & Sharpe debt at July 2, 1994.. (28,535)

Re: Voting of Shares of Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company

Gentlemen:

It is my understanding that under a certain Shareholders Agreement proposed to
be entered into by Finmeccanica S.p.A. ("Finmeccanica") with Brown & Sharpe
Manufacturing Company (the "Company") in connection with its acquisition of
3,450,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company pursuant to a certain
Acquisition Agreement dated as of June 10, 1994, as amended by an Amendment No.
1 to Acquisition Agreement (the "Acquisition Agreement") inter alia, the Board
----- ---- 
of Directors of the Company shall be increased from seven (7) to ten (10)
members to permit the election to the Board of Directors of three (3) nominees
designated by Finmeccanica ("Finmeccanica Nominees"); that the Company shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable after the closing of the Acquisition Agreement,
convene a special meeting (the "Meeting") of its shareholders to consider and
vote upon the approval of this increase in the number of directors of the
Company and the election to the Board of Directors of the Company of the three
Finmeccanica Nominees that Finmeccanica will notify to the Company; that the
Board of Directors of the Company shall nominate one Finmeccanica Nominee per

and that so long as Finmeccanica owns at least 1,250,000 shares of the Company's
Class A Common Stock (as adjusted for any shares issued pursuant to a stock

Nominees (if the Executive Committee is composed of five directors).

In order to induce Finmeccanica to enter into the Shareholders Agreement, I
hereby covenant and agree that at the Meeting and any subsequent meeting of the
