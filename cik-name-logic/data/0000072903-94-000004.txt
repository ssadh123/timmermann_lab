Item 5. Other Events

On January 31, 1994, Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation,
("the Company") received notice that an appeal of the Minnesota Public
Utilities Commission's (MPUC) determination on the allowed return on common
equity was filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals by the Minnesota
Department of Public Service, the Office of the Attorney General and the
Minnesota Energy Consumers intervenor groups. The appeal concerns the method
of calculation of the rate of return on common equity for both the Minnesota
electric and gas cases. The amount at issue is approximately $7 million in
annual revenues for the Company. The ultimate financial impact of this
appeal, if any, is not determinable at this time. A decision by the Court
is expected by year end, 1994.

On January 31, 1994, the Company was notified by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) that it is a potentially responsible
party (PRP) at the Brooklyn Park Superfund site in Minnesota, which is in
addition to the sites identified in the Company's previous filings. The
USEPA states that costs incurred to date in investigating and remediating the
site have been approximately $1,300,000. If NSP is determined to be a
responsible party, it is jointly and severally liable for the costs of
investigation and remediation. Eleven other parties have been named as PRPs. 
The Company is reviewing its records and conducting an investigation to
determine if the site was used by the Company or the other PRPs.
