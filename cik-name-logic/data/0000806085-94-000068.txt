Item 5. Other Events.

Subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (collectively, the
"Company") initiated two separate actions to recover amounts owed
in connection with trading activity conducted by two large
Chinese trading firms, Minmetals International Non-Ferrous Metals
Trading Company ("Minmetals") and China International United
Petroleum and Chemicals Company ("Unipec"). The Company seeks to
recover approximately $53.5 million from Minmetals and/or its
parent, China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export
Corporation and approximately $44 million from Unipec. Trading
positions held by the companies were liquidated for failure to
comply with contractual margin obligations. Since such time,
extensive discussions were held which did not result in payment
of the amounts owed. The Company believes it will be successful
in recovering these amounts.
