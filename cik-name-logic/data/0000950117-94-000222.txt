Item 2 Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On August 26, 1994, First Brands Corporation (the Company) sold its
antifreeze and car care products businesses (excluding STP and SIMONIZ) (the
Business) in an asset sale to Prestone Products Corporation (Prestone), a
company organized and indirectly controlled by Vestar Equity Partners L.P., a
private investment firm. The selling price was $142,000,000 in cash and a
$13,000,000 subordinated debenture maturing in 2003, the fair market value of
which has been estimated at $9,000,000. The debenture carries a cash pay rate of
7 1/2% or an optional compound deferred rate of 10%. As part of the transaction,
the Company will reimburse Prestone approximately $29,000,000, which represents
the proportional interest previously sold in Prestone's accounts receivable
under the Company's securitization program. The consideration received in the
sale was negotiated and is believed to be a fair value for the Business. The
Company is in the process of finalizing its calculation of the gain on sale.
Registrant expects to retain the net proceeds from the sale of the Business for:
1) reduction of debt; 2) the repurchase of 1,500,000 shares of the Company's
common stock; and 3) for future acquisitions and other general corporate
purposes.

The assets sold were all of the assets directly used in the Business
included trademarks, receivables, inventory and the fixed assets at three
antifreeze manufacturing facilities. Liabilities directly involved with the
Business were also assumed.

The Company will provide to Prestone, certain administrative and accounting
services at cost for up to one year, and will supply certain manufactured car
care products at cost for two years. Prestone will provide to the Company
certain automotive laboratory services at cost for up to 2 years. The Company
will also act as Prestone's distributor outside of North America for
compensation believed to be competitive.

that Seller and Buyer will work together and use all reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents necessary to the assignment or transfer of any
other permits or licenses used or held by Seller and its affiliates in
connection with the Businesses which are so assignable or transferable.
Subsequent to the assignment, transfer and conveyance of each asset on or after
Closing, to the extent permitted by law, Seller and its affiliates shall have
the right to cancel any permits or licenses held by Seller and its affiliates
now applicable to such Asset to the extent not assigned or transferred to Buyer
pursuant to this Article 1.5. The failure of Seller and its affiliates to cancel
any permits or licenses shall not affect the respective rights, obligations,
liabilities and indemnifications of Seller and its affiliates by Buyer under
this Agreement.

(b) Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts (which shall not include
agreeing to any modification of the terms of the underlying obligations) to
cause itself to be substituted in all respects for Seller, effective as of
Closing, in respect of all obligations of Seller under each of the bonds,
guarantees, undertakings and letters of credit obtained by Seller for the
benefit of the Businesses (other than those that relate to Excluded Assets)
('Guarantees'), except Guarantees, the obligations underlying which Buyer has
elected to cancel and has notified Seller of such election and is

23

<PAGE>
pursuing or will diligently pursue such cancellation or cancellations. If Buyer
is unable to effect such substitution with respect to any Guaranty after using
all reasonable efforts to do so, Buyer shall obtain letters of credit, on terms
and from financial institutions reasonably satisfactory to Seller, with respect
to the obligations covered by each of the Guarantees (to the extent they relate
to the Businesses) for which Buyer does not effect such substitution. Subsequent
to Closing, with respect to any uncancelled Guaranty for which no substitution
is effected or letter of credit provided, Buyer shall indemnify Seller against
any liability under such Guaranty to the extent they relate to the Businesses
and if such Guarantee remains uncancelled on the 60th day after the Closing,
Buyer shall secure its indemnity by providing Seller with a letter of credit in
Seller's favor from a bank and in an amount reasonably satisfactory to Seller.
If such letter of credit is not provided to Seller within 30 days of Seller's
written request therefor, Seller may cancel or otherwise terminate such
Guarantee.

the rules under Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (
the 'Code'), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Such
allocation shall be prepared in accordance with an appraisal conducted by an
independent appraiser retained by Buyer. If Seller, in good faith, determines
that such proposed allocation is unreasonable, Buyer and Seller agree at their
shared expense to retain the Arbitrator to settle any dispute between Buyer and
Seller regarding the allocations at least 60 days prior to the date upon which
either party is required to file any 1060 Forms. Seller and Buyer agree to act
in accordance with the computations and allocations contained in the allocation
(including any modifications thereto reflecting any post-closing adjustments) in
any relevant tax returns or filings filed by them (including any forms or
reports required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder or any provisions of local, state and foreign
law ('1060 Forms'), and to cooperate in the preparation of any 1060 Forms and to
file such 1060 Forms in the manner required by applicable law. Buyer shall make
available promptly to Seller

<PAGE>
3.2 Indemnification Procedure.

The obligation of a party (the 'Indemnifying Party') to indemnify any
person or entity (the 'Indemnified Party') under Article 3.1 hereof is
conditioned upon receiving from the Indemnified Party written notice of the
assertion or institution of a claim arising from or related to any liability set
forth in Article 3.1 hereof (a 'Claim') or of the occurrence of an event which
the Indemnified Party believes could lead to the assertion of a Claim, promptly
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Claim or event; provided,
however, that the failure of the Indemnifying Party to receive such notice on a
timely basis shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify
hereunder only if and to the extent that such failure is prejudicial to its
ability to defend such Claim. Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the absolute right, in its sole discretion and at its sole
expense, to elect to defend, settle or otherwise protect against any Claim with
legal counsel of its own selection reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party provided, however, that no Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party
without the consent of the Indemnified Party which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate, at its own expense, in the defense thereof through
counsel of its own and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assert
any and all defenses, cross claims or counterclaims it may have and the fees and
expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless
(i) the employment of such counsel and payment of such counsel's fees by the
Indemnifying Party has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party does not employ counsel that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, or there is a conflict of

32

<PAGE>
interest between the position of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the
Indemnified Party on the other hand, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
assume the defense or fails to contest such action in good faith, in any which
case, if the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party that it elects to
employ separate counsel, the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to
assume the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Party and the
reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its affiliates
to, at all times cooperate in all reasonable ways with, make its relevant files
and records available for inspection and copying by, and make (subject to
assertion of attorney-client and other applicable privileges) its employees
available or otherwise render reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party in
connection with its defense of any Claim. Subject to the next sentence, in the
event the Indemnified Party, without prior consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld), makes any settlement with respect to
any Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be discharged from all obligations under
Article 3.1 hereof with respect to such Claim. In the event the Indemnifying
Party fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect against any Claim or
to contest any Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to defend, contest, assert cross claims or counterclaims
or otherwise protect against the same, to make any compromise or settlement
thereof and to recover from the Indemnifying Party and be indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party for the entire cost thereof, including without limitation,
legal expenses, disbursements and all amounts paid as a result of such Claim or
the compromise or settlement thereof.

ARTICLE IV
EMPLOYEES

4.1 Employment and Benefits. Buyer will accept the transfer of employment
of those employees of Seller listed on Schedule 4.1 attached hereto, with such
changes, deletions or additions thereto as may occur from the date hereof to the
Closing in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (the 'Employees'); provided, however that not later
than July 18, 1994 Seller and Buyer shall agree upon a final list of employees
which shall be utilized for the purposes of Article 4.2(a) (such list is
hereinafter referred to as the 'Transfer List' and the employees reflected on
the Transfer List are hereinafter referred to as the 'Transferred Employees').
For purposes of this Article IV, the terms 'Employees' and 'Transferred
Employees' shall not include any person on disability, layoff or leave of
absence as of the Closing; provided, however, that such individuals shall become
Employees as of the Closing if they report to work within ninety (90) days after
the Closing or such longer period as required by law; and provided further, that
during such period all liabilities associated with the employment of such
individuals shall remain the responsibility of Seller. Buyer shall employ each
of the Employees during the one year period after the Closing and such
employment shall be in positions substantially equivalent to those presently
held, with the same or greater wages or salaries as those being enjoyed as of
the Closing and, for one year after the Closing (but two years with respect to
the Buyer's Retirement Plan as hereinafter defined) with benefits substantially
equivalent (except for such changes as may be required by law) in the aggregate
to those provided under Seller's benefit plans and

34

<PAGE>
compensation policies and practices listed in Schedule 4.1 attached hereto;
provided, that except as otherwise specifically provided herein with respect to
the 401(k) Plan and the Savings Plan (each as hereinafter defined); Buyer shall
have no obligation to take into account for any purpose hereunder or provide any
benefits related to or payable in stock of Buyer, Seller or any of their
respective subsidiaries; and, provided, further, that nothing herein shall
preclude any changes required by applicable law or by the increased costs to
provide such benefits other than as specifically provided in Articles 4.2(a) and
4.2(b) hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
nothing herein shall preclude Buyer f;rom terminating any Employee for any
reason for which Seller could have terminated such person prior to the Closing.
Buyer shall accept and credit the Employees, for all purposes under all benefit
plans and compensation policies and practices (subject to the occurrence of the
transfers contemplated by Section 4.2(a) and 4.2(b) hereof), with all previous
service recognized by Seller or its subsidiaries or the predecessor of the
Businesses, Union Carbide Corporation, for benefit plan purposes, and shall
accept and assume responsibility for all current year, vested or carried forward
vacation benefits accrued by each Employee under Seller's vacation plan but not
taken as of the Closing to the extent reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet.

4.2 Pension Plan; Defined Contribution Plan. With respect to the Retirement
Program Plan for Employees of First Brands Corporation and its Participating
Subsidiary Companies (the 'Pension Plan'), the Savings Plan for Employees of
First Brands Corporation and Participating Subsidiary Companies (the 'Savings

('401(k) Plan'),

35

<PAGE>
Buyer and Seller agree as follows:

(a) Pension Plan.

(i) On or before the Closing, Seller shall cause each Employee who is
a participant in the Pension Plan to become fully vested, to the extent not
already vested, as of the Closing in the benefits accrued under the Pension
Plan as of the Closing. Employees shall cease to accrue any benefits under
the Seller's Pension Plan as of the Closing. As of the Closing, the defined
benefit plan established by the Buyer in accordance with Article 4.2(a)(ii)
(the 'Buyer's Retirement Plan') shall include as participants the Employees
who were participants in the Pension Plan immediately prior to the Closing.
Other Employees shall become participants in Buyer's Retirement Plan in
accordance with its terms.

(ii) As soon as practicable after the Closing, Buyer shall establish
the Buyer's Retirement Plan, which shall contain terms substantially
similar to the terms of the Pension Plan, and take any necessary action to
qualify the Buyer's Retirement Plan under the applicable provisions of the
Code. Each of the Buyer and Seller shall make all filings and submissions
to appropriate governmental agencies required of them in connection with a
transfer of assets as described below.

(iii) Upon satisfaction of the obligations described in Article
4.2(a)(ii) above and upon receipt of evidence reasonably acceptable to the
Buyer with respect to the Pension Plan and to the Seller with respect to
the Buyer's Retirement Plan, that each such plan is qualified under the
Code, Seller

36

<PAGE>
shall cause the respective trustees of the Seller's Pension Plan to
transfer an amount equal to $2,750,000 (the 'Transfer Amount') as follows:
(x) within 30 days after the Closing at least 75% of the Transfer Amount in
cash or marketable securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer; and (y)
within 60 days after the transfer in this Subsection (x), the balance of
the Transfer Amount, with interest thereon of 8% per annum in cash or
marketable securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Such transfer will be
made to the trustee of the Buyer's Retirement Plan for the trust of the
Buyer's Retirement Plan and in no event shall less than 25% of all
transfers be made in cash; provided, however, that in no event shall the
amount transferred be less than the amount required under Section 414(1) of
the Code as certified by Sellers' actuaries (which certification shall be
reasonably acceptable to Buyer) or the present value of the accrued
benefits (whether or not vested) under the Pension Plan. Buyer shall
maintain the Buyer's Retirement Plan for no less than two years after the
Closing, in substantially the form adopted (with such changes as are
required by law). Each of the parties hereto shall pay its own expenses in
connection with the foregoing transfer of assets and assumption of
liabilities.

(b) Defined Contribution Plans.

(i) On or before the Closing, Seller shall cause each Employee who is
a participant in the 401(k) Plan or the Savings Plan (the 'Defined
Contribution Plans') to become fully vested, to the extent not already
vested, as of the Closing Date in his account balance under each such plan.
The Defined Contribution Plans shall be amended to provide that
contributions thereto in

37

<PAGE>
respect of Employees shall cease as of the Closing Date.

(ii) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
establish or designate a defined contribution plan or plans (the 'Successor
Plan') and take any necessary action to qualify the Successor Plan under
the applicable provisions of the Code. Each of the Buyer and Seller shall
make all filings and submissions to appropriate governmental agencies
required of them in connection with a transfer of assets as described
below.

(iii) As soon as practicable following the Closing, Seller shall cause
the trustee of the Defined Contribution Plans to calculate, in accordance
with the spin-off provisions set forth under Section 414(1) of the Code and
the specifications described below, the amount of assets and liabilities
held in the Defined Contribution Plans representing the account balances of
all Employees as of the Closing (including, as applicable, all
contributions and all earnings attributable to such contributions) (the
'D.C. Transfer Amount'). As soon as practicable, upon receipt of evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer with respect to the Defined Contribution
Plans and to the Seller with respect to the Successor Plan, that each such
plan is qualified under the Code, Seller shall cause the respective
trustees of the Defined Contribution Plans to transfer in cash, or, with
respect to account balances invested in Seller's stock, Seller's stock, to
the trustee of the Successor Plan, the Transfer Amount, which shall (i)
have been credited with appropriate earnings attributable to the period
from the appropriate valuation date to the day immediately preceding the
date of the transfer described herein, and (ii) reduced by any benefit or
withdrawal

38

<PAGE>
payments in respect of Employees occurring during the period from the
Closing to the day immediately preceding the date of transfer described
herein. Each of the parties hereto shall pay its own expenses in connection
with such transfer. On and after the Closing, subject to the transfer
provided for herein, each participant in the Defined Contribution Plans
shall be entitled to credit under the Successor Plan for all purposes for
all years of service for which credit was granted under the Defined
Contribution Plans.

pertaining to disclosures of inventions made by an employee or employees of
Seller or any affiliate of Seller and assignable to Seller or any affiliate of
Seller and all patent licenses, in each case used in connection with the
Businesses or the Assets (collectively, the 'Patents and Technology'). There are
no other United States or foreign patents or patent applications owned by or
assignable to or used by Seller or any affiliate of Seller, the failure to own
or have the right to use prevents or would prevent Buyer from operating the
Businesses as currently operated; and the Patents and Technology (including any

Businesses as currently operated. Seller or one of its affiliates is the sole
and exclusive owner or licensee, except as set forth in Schedule 5.13(a)
attached hereto, of the Patents and Technology and the holder of the full record
title to the registrations for the Patents. The Patents and Technology are free

as set forth in Schedule 5.13(a), there are no asserted claims or demands of any
other person, firm or corporation pertaining to the Patents and Technology, no

threatened which challenge Seller's rights in respect thereto. Except as set
forth in Schedule 5.13(a), Patent Nos. 4,664,833 (1987) and 4,439,561 (1984) do
not violate the rights of others and, to Seller's Knowledge, are not being
infringed by others and, to Seller's Knowledge, the

53

<PAGE>
remaining Patents and Technology do not violate the rights of others and are not
being infringed by others. The Patents and Technology are not subject to any

necessary to operate the Businesses as currently operated. Except as otherwise
indicated in Schedule 5.13(b), the Trademarks and Licensed Trademarks have been
duly registered or applications to register are pending in the United States and
in the countries indicated therein, and in the case of Licensed Trademarks,
Seller or its affiliates has been duly recorded as a Registered User or the
license agreement has been recorded, as required by local law. Seller is the
sole and exclusive owner or licensee, to the extent shown in Schedule 5.13(b),
of such Trademarks or Licensed Trademarks and the holder of the full record
title to the registrations for such Trademarks, and the Trademarks and, to
Seller's Knowledge, the Licensed Trademarks are free and clear of any
Encumbrances, except as set forth in Schedule 5.13(b), and except where the
failure of Seller or one of its affiliates to be the sole and exclusive owner or
licensee and the holder of full record title does not and will not have a
Material Adverse Effect provided that, with respect to the liens set forth in
Schedule 5.13(b), Part 3, A, I, Seller will take all necessary steps, prior to
Closing, to

54

<PAGE>
file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, all documents necessary
to record the release of said liens against said registrations. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 5.13(b), none of Seller and its affiliates has been
notified of any claims or demands of any other person, firm or corporation
pertaining to such Trademarks or Licensed Trademarks, no proceedings have been
instituted, are pending, or, to Seller's Knowledge, are threatened which
challenge Seller's rights in respect thereto and, except as disclosed on
Schedule 5.13(b), to Seller's Knowledge, such Trademarks and Licensed Trademarks
do not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of others and are not being
infringed by others. Seller specifically warrants and represents that the
trademark PRESTONE in the United States and Canada for automotive antifreezes,
cooling system flushing products and cooling system stop-leak products and the
registrations therefor set forth on Schedule 5.13(b) are valid and subsisting,
and do not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of others and, to
Seller's Knowledge, are not being infringed by others. The Trademarks and
Licensed Trademarks are not subject to any outstanding order, judgment or
stipulation.

(c) Seller specifically warrants that the Assets, together with information
known to the Employees, contain all of Seller's material trade secrets and
confidential technology, proprietary designs, know-how and processes
(collectively 'Trade Secrets') owned and/or used by Seller or its affiliates in
connection with the Businesses, and that such Trade Secrets constitute all those
necessary to operate the Businesses as currently operated. Except as set forth
on Schedule 5.13(c), Seller or its affiliates are the owners of the Trade
Secrets, and where Seller or its affiliates are not the owner of any such Trade
Secret, it is the licensee thereof and all applicable

55

<PAGE>
license agreements are in force and are assignable to Buyer. Seller and its
affiliates have taken all appropriate measures to maintain the confidentiality
of the Trade Secrets, and to Seller's Knowledge, such confidentiality has been
maintained. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.13(c), to Seller's Knowledge, the

does not exist under any provision thereof, to Seller's Knowledge, any event

(b) With respect to each of the Seller's Plans, Seller has made available
to Buyer a current, accurate and complete copy (or, to the extent no such copy
exists, an accurate description) thereof (including all existing amendments
thereto that shall become effective at a later date) and, to the extent
applicable, (i) any related trust agreement, annuity contract or other funding
instrument; and (ii) any summary plan description.

(c) (i) Each of Seller's Plans has been established and administered in

the Code) has heretofore occurred with respect to any of Seller's Plans; and
(iv) no material litigation or administrative or other proceedings involving the
Seller's Plans have occurred or are threatened.

(d) Neither the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries maintains or contributes

is subject to Title IV of ERISA, as of the Closing, the assets of each such plan
are at least equal in value to the present value of the accrued benefits (vested
and unvested) of the participants in such plans on a termination basis, based on
the actuarial methods and assumptions indicated in the most recent actuarial
valuation reports.

5.16 Financial Statements

(a) Attached hereto as Schedule 5.16 are the unaudited combined and
combining statements of income of the Businesses for the fiscal years ended June
30, 1992 and 1993 and for the nine months ended March 31, 1994 and the unaudited
combined and combining balance sheets of the Businesses as of June 30, 1992 and
1993 and March 31, 1994 (the 'Unaudited Financial Statements'). Also attached as
part of Schedule 5.16 are schedules calculating EBITDAG (as defined in Article
9.1(f)) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1992 and 1993, as derived from the
Unaudited Financial Statements for such years. The Unaudited Financial
Statements present fairly the financial position and results of operations of
the Businesses as of the date or for the periods set forth therein, except as
set forth in Schedule 5.16 and, in the case of Unaudited Financial Statements as
of and for the nine months ended March 31, 1994, subject to normal year-end
adjustments, were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ('U.S. GAAP') consistently applied during the periods set forth
therein except as noted on Schedule 5.16; provided, however, that no breach of
this Article 5.16(a) shall give rise to any

59

<PAGE>
claim against Seller for money damages.

(b) Except as specifically disclosed herein or in the Schedules hereto, and
except as reflected, reserved against or otherwise expressly disclosed in the
Unaudited Financial Statements and except for liabilities and obligations or
changes in assets incurred in the ordinary course of business of the Businesses
consistent with past practice, since June 30, 1993 in the case of liabilities or
obligations, and March 31, 1994 in the case of assets, none of the Businesses
will have as of the Closing Date any change in assets, liabilities or
obligations that would be required to be reflected on a balance sheet for the
Businesses prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied during the
period set forth therein. With respect to liabilities as of March 31, 1994 it is
understood that certain of these amounts were estimated by pro-rating total
corporate liabilities based on Seller's reasonable estimate of the Businesses'
share of total liabilities of Seller and its affiliates. Because such
liabilities cannot be specifically identified as liabilities of the Businesses,
no representation is being made with respect to such liabilities reflected on
the balance sheet as of March 31, 1994 included in the Unaudited Financial
Statements.

(c) Seller shall prepare, and shall cause KPMG Peat Marwick to audit, the
combined balance sheet of the Businesses as of June 30, 1994 and the combined
statements of income and cash flows and a statement or footnote as to a change
in net assets of the Businesses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994,
together with the notes thereto, and shall cause KPMG Peat Marwick to audit the
combined Unaudited Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 1992 and 1993 (collectively, the 'Audited Financial Statements'). The
Audited Financial

60

<PAGE>
Statements shall present fairly the financial position and results of operations
of the Businesses as of the dates or for the periods set forth therein and shall
be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied during the periods
set forth therein and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') as to form and content. The Audited Financial
Statements shall be delivered to Buyer and Seller's and KPMG Peat Marwick's work
papers relating thereto shall be made available for review by Buyer upon
completion of the respective audits thereof, which shall be completed no later
than July 20, 1994 in the case of the Audited Financial Statements as of and for
the fiscal years ended June 30, 1992 and 1993 and August 31, 1994 in the case of
the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1994. The reports of KPMG Peat Marwick on the respective Audited Financial
Statements shall be unqualified and shall be delivered to Buyer no later than
July 27, 1994 with respect to the periods ended June 30, 1992 and 1993 and
September 15, 1994 with respect to the period ended June 30, 1994. Such reports
for the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June
30, 1992 and 1993 shall be accompanied by schedules audited by KPMG Peat Marwick
calculating EBITDAG for each such fiscal year as derived from the Audited
Financial Statements for such years.

(d) Subject to an allowance for bad debts, customer claims and sales
returns not in excess of 2% plus $250,000, the accounts and notes receivable of
the Businesses as of the Closing Date will represent valid claims, incurred in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, and no
counterclaims or offsetting claims with respect to such receivables shall be
pending or threatened as of

61

<PAGE>
the Closing Date.

5.17 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since June 30, 1993, the
Businesses have been conducted only in the ordinary course consistent with past

results of operations, assets, properties, business or prospects of the
Businesses;

(b) any damage, destruction or casualty loss, whether or not covered
by insurance, resulting in a Material Adverse Effect;

(c) any disposition by Seller or any of its affiliates of any assets
relating to the Businesses other than in the ordinary course of business

Seller or any of its affiliates on the properties and assets used in connection
with the

62

<PAGE>
Businesses and with respect to the employees and representatives engaged in
connection with the Businesses. In the reasonable judgment of Seller, such
policies cover risks customarily insured by businesses similar to the
Businesses. Such policies are in full force and effect, the premiums due thereon
have been paid and each of Seller and its affiliates have complied with the
provisions of such policies except for failures to be in full force and effect,
to pay premiums and to comply which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.19 Affiliate Transactions Except for the agreements set forth in Article
1.3 hereof, Schedule 5.19 lists all contracts, agreements or other arrangements
relating to the Businesses and in existence on the date hereof with Seller (to
the extent it involves divisions of Seller which are not conducting the
Businesses or where assets are shared with such divisions) and any of its
affiliates where the amount involved exceeds $25,000.

5.20 Insurance; Risk of Loss. (a) Effective as of Closing: (i) Seller will
terminate all coverage relating to the Businesses under the general corporate
policies of insurance and cancelable surety bonds, as listed in Schedule 5.18,
except for claims -- made liability policies which shall not be terminated prior
to the first anniversary of Closing as to losses from events involving the
Businesses prior to Closing; provided however, that no such termination of
occurrence liability policies shall be effected so as to prevent Seller or Buyer
from recovering under such policies for losses from events occurring prior to
Closing, and (ii) Buyer shall become solely responsible for all insurance
coverage and related risk of loss based on events occurring on and after Closing
with respect to the Businesses. Commencing as of

63

<PAGE>
Closing, Buyer shall also be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify Seller
from, all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses relating to the
Businesses within the self-insured retention amounts of the policies listed in
Schedule 5.18 (after taking into account the effect of any prior claim payments
under the terms of such policies), or which are otherwise not covered by such
policies which relate to or arise out of occurrences prior to Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (i) any insurance
policies controlled by Seller ('Seller's Insurance Policies') cover any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense relating to the Businesses relating to or
arising out of occurrences prior to Closing (except to the extent they relate to
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities) (the 'Business Liabilities') and (ii)
Seller's Insurance Policies continue after Closing to permit claims to be made
thereunder with respect to the Business Liabilities relating to or arising out
of occurrences prior to Closing ('Business Claims'), Seller shall (A) use all
reasonable efforts so that Buyer shall have the right, power and authority,
subject to any required consent of the carriers under Seller's Insurance
Policies, in the name of Seller, to make directly any Business Claims under
Seller's Insurance Policies and to receive directly recoveries thereunder, (B)
cooperate with Buyer in submitting the Business Claims (or pursuing the Business
Claims previously made) on behalf of Buyer under Seller's Insurance Policies,
(C) execute any and all agreements and other documents, including limited powers
of attorney on behalf of Buyer, which are reasonably necessary or appropriate in
connection with the foregoing, including an assignment to Buyer of any right to
receive payments for Business Claims under such policies in the event consent to
such assignment can be

64

<PAGE>
or is obtained from any insurer and (D) pay promptly over to Buyer any and all
amounts received by Seller under such policies with respect to such Business
Claims; provided that Seller shall be under no obligation to commence or
maintain litigation to enforce any of the Business Claims. In the event that any
legal action, arbitration, negotiation or other proceedings are required for
Buyer to assert coverage against any insurer to perfect a Business Claim (i)
Buyer shall, to the extent possible, do so at its own expense or (ii) if Buyer
is not permitted to assert coverage or perfect a Business Claim, Seller shall do
so, and, in either event, Buyer shall pay to Seller in advance and hold Seller
harmless and indemnify Seller for costs and expenses actually incurred or
expected to be incurred by Seller as a result of such action.

(v) will refrain from taking any action which reasonably could be
expected to render any representation or warranty or covenant contained in

(vi) will furnish to Buyer such additional financial and operating
data and other information relating to the Businesses as may be readily

terms of any agreement to which Seller is bound or any applicable law or
regulation, and will make (and has made) available to Buyer for inspection
and review all documents, or copies thereof, listed in the Schedules
attached hereto and all files, records and papers of any and all

date hereof;

11.2 Restriction.

86

<PAGE>
(a) From the date of Closing until the 10th anniversary of Closing, except
as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Seller shall not, except in the
Republic of the Philippines, directly or indirectly, and shall not permit any of
its affiliates to engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture, sale,
marketing, supply or other distribution of automotive antifreezes; cooling
system service tools; cooling system chemicals for cleaning and sealing leaks in
automotive cooling systems; cooling system stop-leak products; or ice fighting
products (excluding water removers); or license or permit any person or entity
to use technology or Trade Secrets hereby transferred by Seller to Buyer;
provided, however, that if, prior to the expiration of the covenant set forth in
this Article 11.2, Buyer (subject to the next sentence) shall cease to sell such
products for a consecutive twelve month period, then Seller's obligations under
this Article 11.2 shall cease with respect to those particular products as of
the date Buyer shall cease to sell such products. If Buyer transfers any of such
product lines or portions thereof to a third party, Seller's agreements in this
Article 11.2 shall continue with respect to such third party transferee with
respect to the product lines or portions thereof transferred for the remaining
period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller at any time may acquire a going
business which manufactures, sells, markets, supplies or distributes cooling
system service tools, cooling system chemicals for cleaning and sealing leaks in
automotive cooling systems and/or ice fighting products (excluding water
removers) (collectively 'Seller Prohibited Products'), but only if (i) the gross
revenues of such acquired business derived from the manufacture, sale or
distribution of Seller Prohibited Products during the two most recent fiscal
years represented less than 20% of the total gross revenues of the acquired
business for

87

<PAGE>
such periods, and (ii) Seller sells, liquidates or otherwise disposes of the
portion of the acquired business relating to the Seller Prohibited Products
within twelve months of the date such business is acquired; and Seller at any
time after the third anniversary of Closing may acquire a going business which
manufactures, sells, markets, supplies or distributes Seller Prohibited
Products; provided, however, that prior to the tenth anniversary of Closing
Seller shall not utilize the STP, Son of a Gun or Simonize trademarks or
tradenames in connection with the sale, manufacture, marketing, supply or
distribution of any of the Seller Prohibited Products. The parties agree that
the remedy at law for any breach of any obligation under this Article 11.2 will
be inadequate and that in addition to any other rights and remedies to which it
may be entitled hereunder, at law or in equity, Buyer shall be entitled to
injunctive relief and reimbursement for all reasonable attorney's fees and other
expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement hereof. In the event Buyer
violates the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Article 11.2, Seller's
obligations under this paragraph (a) shall immediately terminate.

(b) Subject to the next two sentences, from the date of Closing until the
fifth anniversary of Closing, except as expressly contemplated otherwise by the
Ancillary Agreements, Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly (a) engage in the
manufacture, sale, marketing, supply or other distribution of engine and oil
additives, fuel additives, fuel injection and carburetor cleaners and vinyl and
tire protectants (the 'Prohibited Products') or (b) provide or make available to
Guarantor or any entity owned or controlled by Guarantor any technology, trade
secrets or consulting services relating to the Prohibited Products and Guarantor
agrees that it will not, nor will it

88

<PAGE>
permit any entity owned or controlled by it (other than Buyer) to, hire any of
the Employees (other than Employees who have ceased to be employees of Buyer for
at least six months); provided, however, that if, prior to the expiration of the
covenant set forth in this Article 11.2, Seller (subject to the next sentence)
shall cease to sell any Prohibited Products for a consecutive twelve month
period, then Buyer's obligations under this Article 11.2 shall cease with
respect to those particular Prohibited Products as of the date Seller shall
cease to sell such Prohibited Products. If Seller transfers any of such
Prohibited Product lines or portions thereof to a third party, Buyer's
agreements in this Article 11.2 shall continue with respect to such third party
transferee with respect to the Prohibited Product lines or portions thereof
transferred for the remaining period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer at
any time may acquire a going business which manufactures, sells, markets,
supplies or distributes Prohibited Products, but only if (i) the gross revenues
of such acquired business derived from the manufacture, sale or distribution of
Prohibited Products during the two most recent fiscal years represented less
than 20% of the total gross revenues of the acquired business for such periods,
and (ii) Buyer sells, liquidates or otherwise disposes of the portion of the
acquired business relating to the Prohibited Products within twelve months of
the date such business is acquired; and Buyer at any time after the third
anniversary of Closing may acquire a going business which manufactures, sells,
markets, supplies or distributes Prohibited Products; provided, however, that
prior to the fifth anniversary of Closing Buyer shall not utilize the Prestone
trademark or tradename in connection with the sale, manufacture, marketing,
supply or distribution of any Prohibited Products. The parties agree that the
remedy at

89

<PAGE>
law for any breach of any obligation under this Article 11.2 will be inadequate
and that in addition to any other rights and remedies to which it may be
entitled hereunder, at law or in equity, Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive
relief and reimbursement for all reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses
incurred in connection with the enforcement hereof.

11.3 Insurance Data. To the extent that, after Closing, either Buyer or
Seller requires any information regarding claim data, payroll or other
information in order to make filings with insurance carriers relating to any of
the Businesses, Seller shall promptly supply such information to Buyer and Buyer
shall promptly supply such information to Seller.

11.4 Interpretation. In the event Article 11.2 hereof is held to be in any
respect an unreasonable restriction upon Seller or any of its affiliates, or
Buyer or any of its affiliates as the case may be, by any court having competent
jurisdiction, the court so holding may reduce the territory to which Article
11.2 hereof pertains and/or the period of time for which Article 11.2 hereof
operates, or effect any change to the extent necessary to render Article 11.2
hereof enforceable by such court. As so modified Article 11.2 hereof will
continue in full force and effect. Such decision by a court of competent
jurisdiction shall not invalidate this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be
interpreted, construed and enforced as not containing such invalidated
provision.

11.5 Further Assurances. At any time after Closing, the parties agree to
cooperate with each other to execute and deliver such other documents,
instruments of transfer or assignment, files, books and records and do all such
further acts and

90

<PAGE>
things as may be reasonably required to carry out the transactions contemplated
hereunder.

11.6 Access to Books, Records and Facilities. Seller agrees that prior to
Closing it will permit, and will cause its affiliates to permit, Buyer and its
representatives full access during normal business hours to all of its and their
respective plants, properties, books, contracts, records and employees used in
or relating to the business or operation of the Businesses and will furnish, and
will cause its affiliates to furnish, Buyer and its representatives during such
period with all such information concerning its business, operations and assets
as it relates to the Businesses as Buyer or its representatives may reasonably
request. Seller agrees that on and after Closing it will permit, and will cause
its affiliates to permit, Buyer and its representatives, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to have access to and to examine and
make copies of all books and records of Seller and its affiliates (except books
and records protected by attorney-client or other privilege which Seller or its
affiliates may be entitled to assert against Buyer or its affiliates in any
pending or threatened proceeding, suit or action) which relate to the Businesses
to the extent that the events reflected therein relate to transactions or events
occurring prior to Closing or to transactions or events occurring subsequent to
Closing which arise out of transactions or events occurring prior to Closing.
All books and records of Seller relating to the Businesses will be preserved by
Seller and its affiliates in accordance with Seller's records retention policy,
but in no event for a period of less than six years following Closing. Prior to
any destruction or disposition by Seller of any books and records relating to
the Businesses, Seller will notify Buyer

91

<PAGE>
in writing and Buyer shall have the right to receive and retain such books and
records at its expense. Buyer agrees that, after Closing, it will permit, and
will cause its subsidiaries to permit, Seller and its representatives full
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of
its and their respective properties, plants and facilities used in connection
with the Businesses, and to have access to the books and records (except records
protected by attorney-client or other privilege which Buyer or its affiliates
may be entitled to against Seller or its affiliates in any pending or threatened
proceeding, action or suit) of the Businesses, to the extent that any of the
foregoing relates to periods prior to Closing, and is reasonably necessary in
connection with any then pending or threatened litigation, claim, liability, or
judicial or administrative matters in which Seller or any of its affiliates is
involved and which involves or arises out of the ownership or operation of the
Businesses by Seller or its affiliates.

11.7 Transitional Use of Trademarks. (a) Seller recognizes that certain
inventory and labels and containers therefor, as well as promotional material
relating to such inventory, being assigned to Buyer under this Agreement will
bear the trademarks 'FIRST BRANDS' and the 'FB Logo' which are not being
assigned or licensed to Buyer. Seller agrees that Buyer will be permitted to
sell such inventory and use such labels, containers and promotional material on
a royalty free basis for a period not exceeding six months after Closing. Buyer
will use all reasonable efforts during such six months period to over stamp
Seller's name and untransferred trademarks and to otherwise use Buyer's name
and/or trademark in their place. Furthermore, Buyer will use Seller's name and
untransferred trademarks pursuant to

92

<PAGE>
this Article 11.7 only to the extent necessary to make an orderly transfer of
the goodwill of the Businesses. In the event such six month period is inadequate
to exhaust existing supplies of product inventory, a short-term extension of
Buyer's rights under this Article 11.7 will not be unreasonably denied by
Seller, but in no event shall such extension extend to the use of Seller's name
and trademarks in advertising such inventory nor shall it exceed a period of
twelve months after Closing.

(b) Buyer recognizes that certain inventory existing at Closing of Seller's
water removal products, waxes and silicone spray products which are not part of
the Businesses, and labels and containers therefor, as well as promotional
material relating to such inventory, will bear the trademark 'Prestone' and the
'Prestone Logo' which are being sold to Buyer. Buyer agrees that Seller and its
affiliates will be permitted to sell such inventory and use such labels,
containers and promotional material on a royalty free basis for a period not
exceeding six months after Closing. In the event such six month period is
inadequate to exhaust supplies of product inventory existing at Closing, a
short-term extension of Seller's rights under this Article 11.7 will not be
unreasonably denied by Buyer, but in no event shall such extension exceed a
period of twelve months after Closing.

11.8 Software Licenses. At Closing, Seller shall grant to Buyer a paid-up,
perpetual royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the software which has been
internally developed by Seller and has been used in connection with the
Businesses, but only to the extent Seller owns or has the right to use and
permit others to use such software royalty free.

11.9 Unassigned Intellectual Property.

93

<PAGE>
(a) Among the assets of Seller and its affiliates located in the Republic
of the Philippines and excluded under Section 1.2(xvii) are the trademarks,
trade names, assumed names, service marks and logos owned by Seller and its
affiliates in the Republic of the Philippines relating to the Businesses,
including the PRESTONE mark, any Philippine patents and patent applications, any
unfiled dockets pertaining to disclosures of inventions made by any employee or
agent of Seller or any of its affiliates in the Republic of the Philippines, and
any copyrights, technology, know-how, processes, trade secrets and any other
intellectual property owned by Seller or any of its affiliates in the Republic
of the Philippines, in each case relating to the Businesses (collectively
'Unassigned Intellectual Property').

(b) Buyer recognizes Seller's exclusive rights in the trademark PRESTONE in
the Republic of the Philippines. Except under written license from Seller, or
its successors or assigns, Buyer shall not use, sell, offer for sale, advertise
or promote any products, nor offer services of any kind, either directly or
indirectly, under the trademark PRESTONE or any mark confusingly similar to the
PRESTONE mark in the Republic of the Philippines.

(c) Seller and its affiliates recognize Buyer's exclusive rights in the
trademark PRESTONE and in the Trademarks listed on Schedule 5.13(b) Part 1, in
the United States, its territories and possessions.

(d) With regard to the rest of the world, Seller recognizes Buyer's
exclusive right in the trademarks listed on Schedule 5.13(b) Part 2, and except
under written license from Buyer, or its successors and assigns and pursuant to
this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its affiliates shall use, sell, offer
for sale, advertise or promote

94

<PAGE>
any products, nor offer services of any kind, either directly or indirectly,
under the trademark PRESTONE, the Trademarks or any mark confusingly similar to
the PRESTONE mark.

(e) If any of the Trade Secrets listed on Schedule 5.13(c) are included in
the Unassigned Intellectual Property, Seller and its affiliates shall maintain
such Trade Secrets as trade secrets, and shall not reveal such Trade Secrets
except under strict confidentiality provisions and under the circumstances set
forth in the second, third and fourth sentences of Article 13.2 hereof, and only
in connection with the manufacture and sale of Seller's products in the Republic
of the Philippines.

(f) Neither Seller nor any of its affiliates shall use, sell or offer for
sale, either directly or indirectly, under any trademark, any product or service
outside the Republic of the Philippines which utilizes the Unassigned
Intellectual Property unless such Unassigned Intellectual Property is shared
technology under Section 1.2 (xvi).

(g) If at any time after the date of this Agreement, Seller desires to sell
any or all of the Unassigned Intellectual Property or to sell, transfer or
assign any or all of the Unassigned Intellectual Property, directly or
indirectly, in connection with a sale of the business or assets then conducted
or utilized in the Philippines by Seller or any of its affiliates or any of
their respective successors, assigns or transferees (the 'Philippines Business')
or otherwise, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing (the 'Offer') of such desire,
specifying the cash price and all other material terms and conditions at and on
which Seller desires to effect said sale (the 'Offer Terms'). Seller's notice
shall contain an irrevocable offer to sell such Unassigned Intellectual Property
or Philippines Business, as the case may be, to Buyer (in the manner set forth
below) on

95

<PAGE>
the Offer Terms. At any time within 30 days after the date of the receipt by
Buyer of Seller's notice, Buyer shall have the right and option to accept the
Offer on the Offer Terms. If Buyer accepts the Offer, Seller and Buyer shall
prepare and negotiate in good faith and execute and deliver a purchase and sale
agreement not inconsistent with the Offer Terms and not containing any material
terms and conditions not included in the Offer Terms as soon as practicable.
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a certified bank check or checks, or wire transfer
immediately available funds, in the appropriate amount at the principal office
of Buyer at a closing of such purchase to be held by the later to occur of (x)
30 days after the execution and delivery of the aforesaid purchase and sale
agreement, (y) 90 days after Buyer's receipt of the Offer, and (z) the
satisfaction of all governmental and regulatory approvals and other requirements
and all other conditions to closing contained in the purchase and sale
agreement. If at the end of the 30 day period in the second preceding sentence
Buyer has not accepted the Offer in the manner set forth in the second preceding
sentence Seller may during the succeeding 180 day period consummate a sale of
the Unassigned Intellectual Property to any third party at a price not less than
ninety percent (90%) of the price included in the Offer Terms, provided that if
said third party sale includes any consideration other than cash, said ninety
percent (90%) shall be applied to the all cash equivalent thereof to be
determined in good faith by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller, or, if they
cannot agree within 10 days after receipt of the third party's offer, as
determined by an investment banking firm mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller,
and otherwise on terms no less favorable to Seller than the Offer Terms (which
shall be the only material terms and conditions applicable to such third

96

<PAGE>
party sale). No sale may be made to any such third party unless such third party
agrees in a writing with Buyer reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
Buyer to be bound by all of the provisions of this Article 11.9 other than this
Article 11.9(g), including but not limited to in connection with any direct or
indirect resale of Unassigned Intellectual Property by such third party.
Promptly after any third party sale, Seller shall notify Buyer of the
consummation thereof and shall furnish such evidence of the completion and time
of completion of such sale and of the terms thereof as may reasonably be
requested by Buyer. At the expiration of the aforesaid 180 day period, all the
restrictions on sale, transfer or assignment contained in this Agreement shall
again be in effect.

Businesses as of the Closing Date and the combined statements of income and cash

ARTICLE XVI
MISCELLANEOUS

16.1 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and
inure to the benefit of, all the parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and assigns permitted in accordance with this Article 16.1.
Except as expressly provided herein, nothing herein shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
hereto. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by any party (by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempted assignment
without the required consents shall be void; provided, however, that no such
consent shall be required for Buyer to assign part or all of its rights under
this Agreement prior to Closing to one or more corporations owned or controlled
by Buyer, or after Closing to a third party, but no such assignment by Buyer

102

<PAGE>
of its rights hereunder shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this
Agreement to Seller.

16.2 Exhibits and Schedules. All Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto and
the documents and agreements referred to herein to be delivered and the acts to
be performed at or subsequent to Closing (collectively, the 'Items') are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as fully as
though completely set forth herein.

16.3 Specific Performance. Seller acknowledges that Buyer will have no
adequate remedy at law if Seller fails to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement. In such event, Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights it may have, to specific performance of this Agreement.

16.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies
hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties.
In pleading or proving any provision of this Agreement, it shall not be
necessary to produce more than one such counterpart.

16.5 Headings; Interpretation.

(a) The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience
of reference only and shall not otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation
or be deemed a substantive part of this Agreement.

(b) Except to the extent that the context otherwise requires 'include,'
'includes' and 'including' are deemed to be followed by 'without limitation'
whether or

103

<PAGE>
not they are in fact followed by such words or words of like import.

16.6 Waiver. The failure of any party at any time or times to enforce or
require performance of any provision hereof shall in no way operate as a waiver
or affect the right of such party at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver
by any party of any condition or the breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver
of any such condition or breach, or a waiver of any other condition or of any

intent, failing which, it shall be severed from this Agreement with the balance
of this Agreement continuing in full force and effect. Such occurrence shall not
have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid in any other
