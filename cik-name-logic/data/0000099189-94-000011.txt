Item 2. Acquisition of Assets

On February 13, 1994, Transamerica Container Acquisition Corporation
("Transamerica" or "Purchaser"), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement
(the "Agreement") with Tiphook plc, a London-based transportation equipment
rental company, and certain of its affiliated companies ("Tiphook" or
"Sellers") pursuant to which Transamerica agreed to purchase certain dry cargo
containers, tank containers, chassis, operating leases and other assets of
Tiphook (collectively the "Container Operations"). Purchaser is a newly
formed subsidiary of Transamerica Finance Corporation ("Registrant").

On March 15, 1994, the transaction was completed and Transamerica
acquired substantially all the operating assets of the Container Operations of
Tiphook. Transamerica assumed certain specified liabilities of the Container
Operations including trade accounts payable. Transamerica did not assume any
borrowings, tax liabilities or contingent liabilities of the Sellers or the
Tiphook Group. In accordance with the Agreement, Transamerica paid to Tiphook
673 million pounds sterling, with further payments to be made upon release of
escrows, delivery of bills of sale and releases of liens, and delivered
34.5 million pounds sterling to escrow agents for the establishment of a
general escrow account (27.5 million pounds sterling) and a repairs escrow
account (7.0 million pounds sterling). When completed, payments to the
Sellers may total up to 722 million pounds sterling (about $1,065 million).

Claims may be made against the general escrow account by Transamerica for
any claim for indemnity (see below) including for breach of warranty. The
Agreement provides that any amounts owed to Transamerica by Tiphook in respect
of any purchase price adjustment shall be paid directly to Transamerica by
Tiphook rather than from the escrowed funds. Only if Tiphook is prohibited by
law from making the payment (or otherwise does not make the payment) will the
funds be paid from the general escrow account, in which case Tiphook is
required under the Agreement to replenish such account to the extent of any
funds so withdrawn by Transamerica. No amounts will be released from the
general escrow to the Sellers until March 31, 1995. The amount released on
March 31, 1995 will be minus (i) any purchase price adjustments (following the
examination of the net assets at closing) deducted from the general escrow and
not replenished; and (ii) any amounts paid to Transamerica in settlement of
any claim covered by the general escrow, and then only to the extent not
necessary to cover any pending claims lodged by Transamerica.

Claims may be made against the repairs escrow account to the extent that
the amounts required to repair certain containers exceed the amounts accrued
by the Sellers in respect of such repairs. Transamerica may also claim
against this escrow if any purchase price adjustment arising from the post-
closing audit is not paid directly by Tiphook. No amounts will be released to
Tiphook from the repairs escrow until the end of the six month anniversary of
the closing. The amount paid will be minus (i) any purchase price adjustments
(following the audit of the net assets at closing) deducted from the repairs
escrow and not replenished and (ii) any amount paid to Transamerica in
settlement of any claim covered by the repairs escrow and not replenished, and
then only to the extent not necessary to cover any pending repair claims
lodged by Transamerica. Fifty per cent of the amount remaining in the repairs
escrow (and not necessary to cover any pending claims) will be released
earlier than the six month anniversary if the net assets audit is completed
and agreed to before then and certain other conditions are satisfied.

<PAGE>
Page 3

Adjustments to the purchase price, if any, will be determined on
completion of examination of the closing balance sheet of the Container
Operations as at the closing date by Transamerica's auditors and Tiphook's
auditors, respectively. Any unresolved dispute will be referred to an
independent auditor.

The Sellers have given representations and warranties as to the assets
including the contracts and operating leases sold and as to Tiphook's
container rental business and agreed to indemnify Transamerica for any
breaches of the Sellers' representations or warranties. Claims for breach of
representations or warranties must be brought within two years of closing
(other than those relating to taxation and environmental matters which survive
for the applicable statutes of limitation). The liability of the Sellers for
indemnification is limited to the purchase price paid by Transamerica to the
Sellers plus the amounts paid into the escrow accounts. The indemnification
provisions cover among other matters breaches of warranty, contingent
liabilities, if any, of the Container Operations, taxation liabilities, the
conduct of the business of the Container Operations prior to the closing and
environmental liabilities.

Tiphook, at the closing, entered into a non-compete agreement with
Transamerica prohibiting Tiphook and its affiliates from competing with the
Container Operations for a period of seven years. After the closing, Sellers
are providing certain transitional services to Transamerica pursuant to the
terms of a transitional services agreement.

Tiphook has granted Transamerica an exclusive, perpetual license to the
name "Tiphook" in the business of leasing containers (on a worldwide basis)
and tank chassis (in the United States).

(b) Pro forma Financial Information

The Pro forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of Transamerica
Finance Corporation as of December 31, 1993 reflects the financial
position of Transamerica Finance Corporation after giving effect to the
acquisition of the assets and assumption of the liabilities discussed in
Item 2. The pro forma consolidated balance sheet assumes the acquisition
took place on December 31, 1993 and is based upon the October 31, 1993
balance sheet of the Container Rental Businesses. The Pro forma
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended
December 31, 1993 reflects adjustments to the cost of borrowings at
Transamerica Finance Corporation and the Container Rental Businesses,
using rates in effect had the acquisition occurred December 31, 1993, as
if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 1993 and based upon the
operations of the Container Rental Businesses for the twelve month period
ended October 31, 1993. No adjustments have been made to reflect
potential operating efficiencies from the consolidation of these
operations.

Sheet as of December 31, 1993 ............. Page F-1
Pro forma Condensed Consolidated Income
Statement - Year ended December 31, 1993 .. Page F-2
Notes to Pro forma Financial Information .... Page F-3

The unaudited pro forma financial statements and accompanying notes
reflect the purchase of assets and the assumption of certain liabilities
of the Container Rental Businesses. The purchase price will be allocated
to the Container Rental Businesses assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their relative estimated fair values at the closing
date. As described in the accompanying notes, the amounts allocated to
the Container Rental Businesses assets and liabilities have been
combined with the recorded values of the assets and liabilities of
Transamerica Finance Corporation. However, changes to the adjustments
already included in the unaudited pro forma financial statements are
expected as evaluations of assets and liabilities are completed and as
additional information becomes available. In addition, the results of 

<PAGE>
Page 5

operations of the Container Rental Businesses subsequent to October 31,
1993 will affect the allocation of the purchase price. Accordingly, the
final combined amounts will differ from those set forth in the unaudited
pro forma financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared by
Transamerica Finance Corporation based upon assumptions deemed proper by
it. The unaudited pro forma financial statements presented herein are
shown for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative
of the future financial position or future results of operations of the
combined company, or of the financial position or results of operations
of the combined company that would have actually occurred had the
transaction been in effect as of the date or for the period presented. 
In addition, it should be noted that Transamerica Finance Corporation's
financial statements will reflect the acquisition only from March 15,
1994, the closing date of the transaction.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements of Transamerica
Finance Corporation and the Container Rental Businesses financial
statements and related notes.

Businesses as of October 31, 1993 were valued based on the
information obtained during due diligence conducted by Transamerica
prior to execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Container
Rental Businesses assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be
recorded based upon fair values as of March 15, 1994, the actual date
of acquisition.

below:

Increase (decrease) to the Container
