substantially enrich Viacom's long-term prospects."

Mr. Huizenga said, "I am extremely proud of the company we have built and the
team behind this growth. Our pending merger with Viacom represents
Blockbuster's future, one that will continue to deliver value for our
shareholders. We share Viacom's vision of what can be accomplished by
combining the assets of Viacom and Blockbuster and we are committed to ensuring
that this goal is realized."
