CLARK EQUIPMENT'S MELROE UNIT ANNOUNCES
$15.0 MILLION PLANT EXPANSION IN NORTH DAKOTA

SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, July 26, 1994 -- Melroe Company, a North Dakota-based
subsidiary of Clark Equipment Company (NYSE: CKL), today announced plans
to expand its Bobcat skid-steer loader manufacturing facility at Gwinner,
North Dakota. The $15.0 million project is slated for completion in late
1995. It will add more than 160,000 square feet of space to the existing
567,000 sq. ft. Gwinner plant and include a new 112,500 sq. ft. building
to house Bobcat loader assembly and a 50,000 sq. ft. fabrication shop
addition.

"Growing worldwide demand for Melroe's Bobcat skid-steer loaders is
driving this expansion," said Clark chief executive officer, Leo J.
McKernan. "The skid-steer loader industry has generated record growth in
recent years. Last year 30,000 units were sold by North American
manufacturers," said McKernan. With a worldwide market share of more than
50 percent, Melroe is the leading manufacturer of skid-steer loaders and
had 1993 sales of $470 million.

Exports of Bobcat skid-steer loaders to Europe, Latin America and the Far
East are a major factor in the strong growth Melroe is experiencing.
According to James Kertz, Melroe Company President, "The European skid-
steer loader business has shown solid gains over the past several years.
Europe has also become a major market for mini-excavators produced at
Melroe's Bismarck, North Dakota, plant. This plant expansion gives us
room for expected future growth in the industry and the timing of that
growth will be dictated by economic factors. We are optimistic about the
long-range trends." He added that Melroe is establishing a joint venture
with Marubeni Corporation of Japan to market North Dakota-built Bobcat
loaders in Japan. The joint venture, Marubeni Bobcat Sales Company, will
set up a Japanese Bobcat dealer network.

In response to Melroe's significant growth, Kertz said, "Since 1991
employment has increased by over 200 to 1,660 employees worldwide, with
850 people located in Gwinner. The new building will give everyone a
little more elbow room and allows more flexibility in our use of multi-
task manufacturing cells." 

Groundbreaking for the new facility is expected in late August with the
assembly building enclosed before winter. In addition to creating new
manufacturing space, the project includes a railroad siding to receive raw
materials and to ship finished products for overseas distribution using
rail containers. Another major component of the project is an extension
of

the overhead conveyor system used in the factory, crossing the Burlington
Northern railroad tracks to the new assembly building. The portion of the
conveyor which connects the existing assembly building to the new assembly
building will be fully enclosed with an elevated skyway that allows
delivery of both finished and ready-to-assemble components to their point
of use.

More than 7,000 feet of new conveyor is expected to be installed, adding
to the existing 14,000 feet of conveyor now in use at Gwinner.

In addition to the Gwinner plant, Melroe also operates a 400,000 sq. ft.
facility in Bismarck. The two North Dakota facilities supply all of the
Bobcat loaders, excavators, attachments and Spra-Coupe crop sprayers sold
through Melroe's worldwide dealer network. Melroe is the only U.S.
manufacturer of mini-excavators. The company has locations in Chicago,
Illinois; Coral Gables, Florida; Brussels, Belgium; and Singapore, as well
as Fargo, Gwinner and Bismarck, North Dakota.

Melroe Company is a business unit of Clark Equipment Company, South Bend,
Indiana. Clark's business is the design, manufacture and sale of skid-
steer loaders, construction machinery, asphalt paving equipment, and axles
and transmissions for off-highway equipment.
