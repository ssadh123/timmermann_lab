Item 5. Other Events

The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") has retroactively
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS 112) as of January 1, 1993.
Results for the first quarter of 1993 have been restated to include the
recognition of a one-time, noncash, after-tax charge of $12 million related to
consolidated operations. This amount is net of income tax benefits of $8
million. The transition effect charge consists primarily of health benefits
for surviving spouses and disabled employees. The incremental impact of SFAS
112 on 1993 consolidated operations is immaterial and will be included in the
results of operations for the fourth quarter of 1993. The adoption impact of
SFAS 112 on the Company's bottling investees accounted for by the equity method
is immaterial and, therefore, has not been included in the transition effect
charge. Net income per share for the first quarter of 1993 has been reduced by
$0.01 for the adoption of SFAS 112.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

Note - Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule
10-01 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all information and notes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material
change in the information disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial
statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of The Coca-Cola Company
(the Company) for the year ended December 31, 1992. In the opinion of
Management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating
results for the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended March 31, 1993, June
30, 1993, and September 30, 1993 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 1993.

The Company filed a Form 8-K on February 17, 1993 restating the 1992
quarterly reports for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions" (SFAS 106) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). The impact of the restatement
on the first quarter of 1992 includes the after-tax transition charge of $219
million related to SFAS 106.

The Company retroactively adopted SFAS 109 by restating financial statements
beginning in 1989. The effect of SFAS 109 for the first three quarters of 1992
for consolidated operations was not material. However, the income statements
for the first, second and third quarters of 1992 have been restated for the
impact of SFAS 109 on the Company's equity investees. Equity income has been
increased by $12 million in the first quarter of 1992, reduced by $15 million
in the second quarter of 1992 and increased by $6 million in the third quarter
of 1992 for the impact of SFAS 109 on the Company's equity investees. Equity
income was reduced $3 million in each of the first, second and third quarters
of 1992 for the Company's proportionate share of additional postretirement
benefits expense recognized by the Company's equity investees after transition
to SFAS 106.

<PAGE>

The Company has retroactively adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS
112) as of January 1, 1993. Results for the first quarter of 1993 have been
restated to include the recognition of a one-time, noncash, after-tax charge of
$12 million related to consolidated operations. This amount is net of income
tax benefits of $8 million. The transition effect charge consists primarily of
health benefits for surviving spouses and disabled employees. The incremental
impact of SFAS 112 on 1993 consolidated operations is immaterial and will be
included in the results of operations for the fourth quarter of 1993. The
adoption impact of SFAS 112 on the Company's bottling investees accounted for
by the equity method is immaterial and, therefore, has not been included in the
transition effect charge. Net income per share for the first quarter of 1993
has been reduced by $0.01 for the adoption of SFAS 112.
