Subsequent Funding Date, and the application of such Equity Amount to the
payment of Construction Costs and funding of the Debt Service Reserve to
the extent contemplated by Section 8.19. Advances (other than those made

acceleration of the Construction Notes pursuant to Section 13.2 hereof, (y)
the Construction Note Maturity Date, or (z) the consummation of the
transactions to be effected on the Conversion Date. You shall record your
Advances on your Construction Notes, but any failure to make any such
notation or any error in any such notation shall not affect the obligations
of the SPV under such Construction Note or any other Transaction
Document. At any time, the aggregate principal amount of the Construction
Notes outstanding shall be the sum of the Advances made hereunder and not
paid. 

Section 1.3 Draw Requests. The Construction Manager shall deliver a
Draw Request signed by the SPV to you, the Independent Engineer, the
Collateral Agent and the Disbursement Agent at least five (5) Business

on the Construction Notes shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-
day year and actual days elapsed.

(b) Maturity. The Construction Notes will mature on September

Section 1.6 Payments on the Construction Notes.

principal amount of the Construction Notes shall be subject to
prepayment only under the circumstances and upon the terms, set
forth in Section 1.6(c) or Section 11 of this Agreement; otherwise the
Construction Notes shall not be prepayable in whole or in part. The
principal amount of the Construction Notes outstanding on the
Construction Note Maturity Date shall be payable on such date with
the proceeds of the Term Notes.

(c) Prepayment. If the Construction Notes are outstanding on
the Construction Option Amount Prepayment Date, the SPV may prepay

Construction 
<PAGE> -3-<PAGE>
Option Amount Prepayment Date. As used in this Section 1.6(c), the following
terms have the following meanings:

"Construction Exit Fee" shall mean, if the principal amount
of Construction Notes to be prepaid on the Construction Option
Amount Prepayment Date is $50,000,000, a fee equal to Seven
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) and, if the principal
amount of Construction Notes so to be prepaid is a lesser
amount, a portion of such fee equal to (i) $750,000 multiplied by
(ii) the quotient of (a) the principal amount so to be prepaid
divided by (b) $50,000,000.

"Construction Option Amount" means a principal amount of
the Construction Notes equal to Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000).

"Construction Option Amount Prepayment Date" means the
date in the ninth calendar month after the month in which the
Initial Funding Date falls that is the same numerical date of
the month as the date of the Initial Funding Date.

Section 1.7 Fees Payable to the Purchaser in Connection with
Construction Notes.

(a) Commitment Fees. Lime, on behalf of the SPV, has
heretofore paid you $500,000 in respect of your consideration of the
financing contemplated by this Agreement. On or prior to the Initial
Funding Date, the SPV shall pay or cause to be paid to you an
additional Seven Hundred Forty-Eight Thousand Dollars ($748,000) in
consideration of your commitment hereunder.

(b) Rate Delayed Delivery Fee. If all of the Construction Notes
have not been advanced before the first day of the Rate Commitment
Period with respect thereto, then, beginning on the last day of the
first month following the commencement of such Rate Commitment
Period and continuing on the last day of each month thereafter
during such Rate Commitment Period, the SPV shall pay to you in
respect of the amount of such unadvanced Construction Notes a fee
(the "Rate Delayed Delivery Fee") equal to (i) the average daily
balance of the unadvanced principal amount of the Construction Notes
during such month, multiplied by (ii) a rate per annum equal to the
Uncompensated Yield Rate with respect to the Construction Notes
(determined as of the Rate Acceptance Date with respect to the
Construction Notes), computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
actual days elapsed, multiplied by (iii) the quotient of (x) the number
of days in such month divided by (y) 360. As used herein, the "average
daily balance" for any month shall mean the sum of the unadvanced
balances on each and every day during such month divided by the
number of such days.

(c) Cancellation Fee. The SPV may at any time, upon thirty (30)
days prior written notice to you, cancel all or any portion of the
Unused Commitment, provided that, in the written opinion of the
Independent Engineer (which shall be reasonably acceptable to you),
the portion of the Unused Commitment remaining after such
cancellation is sufficient to pay all Construction Costs as well as
the initial funding of the Debt Service Reserve in an amount equal to
One Year's Debt Service. Upon any such cancellation and, in any
event, if the entire amount of the Commitment Amount has not been
borrowed or cancelled prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the
Conversion Date or (ii) the Construction
<PAGE> -4-<PAGE>
Note Maturity Date, the SPV shall immediately pay to you a
cancellation fee (a "Cancellation Fee") as follows:

(A) the amount of Construction Notes which has been so
cancelled or not borrowed, multiplied by

(B) (1) the Hedge Treasury Security Bid Price Increase
with respect to the Construction Notes (determined as of the
date of such notice, the Conversion Date or the Construction
Note Maturity Date, as the case may be), divided by (2) the Hedge
Treasury Security Bid Price.

In no event shall any Cancellation Fee be less than zero ($0). The
Cancellation Fee shall compensate you for lost opportunity costs and
the costs of re-establishing any investment portfolio position
altered at the time the relevant interest rate was accepted by the
SPV. Such amount shall not be deemed to compensate you for any
other fees incurred in connection with the preparation of, or the
closing or funding of the transaction contemplated by, this
Agreement. Upon payment of the Cancellation Fee, the Rate Delayed
Delivery Fee shall cease to accrue with respect to that portion of
the Unused Commitment so cancelled.

(d) Servicing Fee. The SPV shall pay to you a construction
servicing fee (the "Construction Servicing Fee") of Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000) per annum during the Construction Period, payable in
equal installments semi-annually in arrears on each Debt Payment
Date, commencing on the Debt Payment Date next succeeding the Initial
Funding Date, with a final payment on the Conversion Date, provided
that the Construction Servicing Fee due on the first Debt Payment
Date and the Conversion Date shall be in amounts equal to a ratable
portion of the Construction Servicing Fee then due for the period
ending on such date and commencing on, in the case of the first Debt
Payment Date, the Initial Funding Date and in the case of the
Conversion Date, the Debt Payment Date immediately prior thereto. 

(e) Manner of Payment of Fees; Interest on Overdue fees. All
fees required by this Section 1.7 shall be paid in the same manner as
payments made in respect of the Construction Notes. Any amount of
fees not paid on the date due shall thereafter bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the highest rate from time to time applicable
to any overdue payment in respect of any of the Construction Notes.

Section 1.8 Use of Proceeds of Construction Notes. The proceeds of
the Construction Notes will be used to pay Construction Costs, Transaction
Expenses, the Required Reserve Payment and the distribution (if any)
provided for in the last sentence of Section 2.1(b) of the Deposit and
Disbursement Agreement, and for no other purpose. The SPV shall not use
the proceeds of the Construction Notes to pay any Contingency Costs
unless such Contingency Costs are determined in writing by the Independent
Engineer to be reasonably and necessarily incurred and you shall have
concurred in such determination; provided, however, that the SPV may pay
Contingency Costs that do not exceed $100,000 with respect to any
individual instance and $750,000 in the aggregate (and enter into any
change orders to effect the foregoing) without the prior consent of the
Independent Engineer. On the Conversion Date, the amount of the Required
Reserve Payment shall be deposited by the SPV to the Debt Service Reserve.

Section 2.2 Payments on the Term Notes.

<PAGE> -6-<PAGE>
Section 2.3 Optional Prepayments of Term Notes.

(a) Prepayment with Make-Whole Amount. After the Conversion
Date, the SPV may prepay the entire principal amount of the Term

so prepaid,

(ii) interest on such principal amount accrued to the
prepayment date, and

(iii) all other amounts due and owing to you and the
Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Transaction
Document.

(b) Prepayment Without Make-Whole Amount. If the SPV has not
exercised the prepayment rights with respect to the Construction

result there are no Construction Notes outstanding on the
Construction Option Amount Prepayment Date), the SPV may prepay the
Term Option Amount of the Term Notes, or any portion thereof, on the
Term Option Amount Prepayment Date, together with interest on the
Term Option Amount, or such portion, accrued to the Term Option
Amount Prepayment Date. The SPV shall give notice of any such
prepayment to the Collateral Agent and to the Holders not less than
ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days before the Term Option
Amount Prepayment Date, stating that the Term Option Amount, or a
specified portion thereof, will be prepaid on such date. Notice of
such prepayment having been so given, the Term Option Amount, or
such specified portion thereof, accrued interest thereon (but not any
Make-Whole Amount in respect thereof) and the Term Exit Fee shall
become due and payable on the Term Option Amount Prepayment Date. 
As used in this Section 2.3(b), the following terms have the following
meanings:

"Term Exit Fee" means, if the principal amount of Term
Notes to be prepaid on the Term Option Amount Prepayment Date
is the $50,000,000, a fee equal to Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($750,000) and, if the principal amount of Term Notes so
to be prepaid is a lesser amount, a portion of such fee equal to

amount so to be prepaid divided by (b) $50,000,000.

"Term Option Amount" means a principal amount of the Term
Notes equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000).

"Term Option Amount Prepayment Date" means May 1, 1995.

notice of any optional prepayment of Term Notes pursuant to Section 2.3(a)
to the Collateral Agent and to the Holders of Term Notes not less than ten
(10) days nor more than thirty (30) days before the date fixed for
prepayment, specifying 

(a) such date, and
<PAGE> -7-<PAGE>
(b) that such prepayment is being made pursuant to Section
2.3(a) of this Agreement.

Notice of prepayment having been so given, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Term Notes together with the Make-Whole Amount (as
calculated by you absent manifest error), if any, and accrued interest
thereon shall become due and payable on the specified prepayment date.

Section 2.5 Application of Prepayments. Each prepayment made
pursuant to Section 1.6(c) or Section 2.3 shall reduce pro rata the amounts
of principal becoming due on each Debt Payment Date subsequent to the date
of such prepayment, such pro rata reduction to be determined by multiplying
the amount of each required payment of principal set forth on Annex 2
hereto by the quotient of the principal amount of Notes so prepaid divided
by the principal amount of Notes outstanding immediately prior to such
prepayment. Immediately after any such prepayment, Annex 2 hereto shall
be deemed to have been amended to (i) reduce subsequent required payments
of principal as aforesaid, and (ii) reduce the amount of interest payable on
each subsequent Debt Payment Date to an amount equal to the amount of
accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of the
Notes to such date (assuming for such purpose that all payments will be
made on the date due).

Section 2.6 Term Servicing Fee. The SPV shall pay to you a term
servicing fee of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) per annum, payable
in equal installments semi-annually in arrears on each Debt Payment Date,
commencing on the Debt Payment Date next succeeding the Conversion Date,
with a final payment on the Term Note Maturity Date, provided that the
amount of such fee due on the first Debt Payment Date after the
Conversion Date and the amount due on the Term Note Maturity Date shall be
in amounts equal to a ratable portion of such fee then due for the period
ending on such date and commencing on, in the case of such first Debt
Payment Date after the Conversion Date, the Conversion Date, and in the
case of the Term Note Maturity Date, the Debt Payment Date immediately
prior thereto.

Section 2.7 Surrender of Term Notes on Prepayment. If any Term Note is
prepaid, such Term Note shall be surrendered to the SPV for cancellation
and shall not be reissued, and no Term Note shall be issued in lieu of the
prepaid principal amount of any Term Note.

Section 2.8 No Other Prepayments. Except as provided in this Section 2,
the SPV may not make any prepayment (whether directly or indirectly, or by
purchase or other acquisition) in respect of the Term Notes.

which it is presently proposed to be conducted.

Section 4.2 Due Authorization; No Conflict. Each of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which the SPV is a party has been
duly authorized by all necessary action on its part, has been duly executed
and delivered by the SPV, and its execution, delivery and performance
thereof do not (i) violate the Partnership Agreement, (ii) contravene any
Applicable Law binding on it or affecting the Project, (iii) contravene or
result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, any indenture,
mortgage, loan agreement, deed of trust, lease or other agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound or (iv) result in, or

upon or with respect to any of the Property now owned or hereafter

Section 4.3 Enforceability. Each of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which the SPV is a party constitutes its legal,
valid and binding obligation, 
<PAGE> -9-<PAGE>
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and by general equitable principles.

Section 4.4 Litigation. There is no action, suit, investigation,
proceeding or arbitration pending or to the SPV's knowledge threatened
against the SPV, any of its Properties, the Project, the Site or the Black
River Common Facilities; and no such proceeding is pending or threatened
against any of the foregoing that questions the validity, enforceability or
performance of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Transaction
Documents. Except as set forth on Part 4.4 of Annex 3 attached hereto,
there is no action, suit, proceeding or arbitration pending or, to the best
knowledge of the SPV, threatened against the SPV or Lime that (if and when
decided) could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
their respective business conditions (financial or otherwise) or
operations, or the fulfillment of the Projections, or that could reasonably
be expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of either of
them to perform its obligations under any of the Transaction Documents, or
the maintenance of the Project, the Site, the Black River Common Facilities,
or the installation, construction, testing, ownership, leasing, use,
possession, operation and maintenance of the Project or any part thereof,
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Notes or any of the other Transaction Documents.

Section 4.5 Governmental Approvals. All Governmental Approvals
required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and each other Transaction Document to which the SPV is a party, and all
material Governmental Approvals required in connection with the
construction of the Project or any part thereof as contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, have been obtained and are completely and
accurately listed in Annex 4 hereto, together with the name in which each
such Governmental Approval must be issued. All such Governmental
Approvals have been given, obtained, made, filed or recorded, as the case
may be, and each is subsisting and in full force and effect and contains no
condition required to be met on the date hereof which has not been met, and
no such Governmental Approval is subject to any pending or, to the SPV's
knowledge, threatened, suit, action, inquiry, investigation, proceeding or
appeal (administrative, judicial or otherwise). The time for appeal with
respect to each such Governmental Approval has expired (or if an appeal
has been taken the same shall have been dismissed or otherwise been
finally determined to be unsuccessful). Such Governmental Approvals are
free from conditions or requirements which could reasonably be expected to
affect materially and adversely (i) the performance by the SPV and Lime
under the Transaction Documents, (ii) the construction of the Project and
the Common Facilities or any part thereof as contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, or (iii) the valid transfer, grant or assignment (as
the case may be) of the rights, title, interests and estate to be
transferred, granted and assigned pursuant to the Transaction Documents. 
The statements made and information provided by or on behalf of the SPV or
Lime, as the case may be, in connection with each such Governmental
Approval were true, complete and correct in all material respects when
made. Annex 4 hereto lists all other material Governmental Approvals which
will be necessary to obtain prior to the commencement of commercial
operation of the Project (and the SPV has no reason to believe that such
Governmental Approvals will not be obtained prior to the Conversion Date). 
To the SPV's knowledge, no Governmental Approvals are required to enable
you, the Collateral Agent and the Disbursement Agent to participate in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, prior to acquiring the Project through foreclosure or
conveyance or transfer in lieu of foreclosure. All Governmental 
<PAGE> -10-<PAGE>
Approvals with respect to which a public hearing was necessary have been
duly issued, and any appeal period with respect to such issuance has
expired.

all Federal, state and local income, franchise and other tax returns, if any,
required to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof, and has paid any
Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns; Lime has paid (or caused
to be paid) all other Taxes in respect of the Project and the Site to the
extent the same have become due and payable and before they have become
delinquent.

easement and use rights in and to the Easement Parcel and the Black
River Common Facilities in accordance with the terms of the Easement
Agreement, and (z) fee title in and to the Project, free and clear of
all Liens (other than Permitted Encumbrances), and such Permitted
Encumbrances do not impair or interfere with (A) the marketability of
the Project, the Project Land, the SPV's rights in and to the Easement
Parcel or the leasehold estate created under the Ground Lease, or (B)
the maintenance of the Project, the Site or the Black River Common
Facilities or the construction, testing, ownership, leasing, use,

Black River Common Facilities.

(d) The SPV Collateral is not subject to any Lien, except for

default under any of the Existing Creditors Loan Documents.

Section 4.10 Full Disclosure. Neither this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, nor any certificate, document, or financial
statement (other than the Projections) or other written information
furnished to you by Lime, the SPV or any Partner in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to 
<PAGE> -11-<PAGE>
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that
could materially and adversely affect Lime, the SPV, you, the Project, the
Common Facilities or the Site. All written factual information delivered by
Lime or the SPV or any Partner to the Independent Engineer was true,
accurate and complete in all material respects at the time supplied and did
not fail to state any material fact necessary to make the information
supplied, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not
misleading. The Projections have been prepared in good faith, to the best
knowledge of the SPV, by Continental Bank Lease Capital Group, and
approved in good faith by each of the SPV and Lime, and are based upon (i)
assumptions that the SPV believes are reasonable and (ii) the best
information available from the management of Lime at the time of the
preparation of such Projections. The SPV has no reason to believe that the
Projections are false or misleading in any material respect.

Section 4.11 Financial Statements of the Corporation and Lime. The
copies of the financial statements of the Corporation and Lime delivered to
you pursuant to Section 5.27 are complete and correct in all material
respects and fairly present the Corporation's and Lime's financial position
as of the dates thereof, and the results of their respective operations
for the periods therein indicated, all in conformity with GAAP consistently

nor any Partner has any contingent liability other than those created
pursuant to the Transaction Documents.

possesses or is duly licensed for a period ending after the Term Note
Maturity Date in respect of all patents, trade secrets, processes,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and licenses and rights
as are necessary for the commercial operation of the Project, without any
conflict with the rights of other Persons and without any obligation to pay
royalties or license fees therefor.

Section 4.14 Taxes. None of the acquisition, installation,
construction, maintenance, financing, use, conveyance or operation of the
Project, the Project Land, the Black River Common Facilities, or the
execution, recordation or filing of any Transaction Document by the
respective parties thereto, or the consummation of any of the transactions

the SPV will be able to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the
Project Contracts to which such Person is a party. Other than the
Transaction Documents to which the SPV is a party, the SPV is not a party
to, nor is any Property of the SPV bound by, any other material agreement.

Section 4.18 Collateral Documents. The SPV Security Agreement
and the Project Mortgage are effective to create a legal, valid and
enforceable Lien upon the SPV Collateral in favor of the Collateral Agent,
and upon proper recording or filing in the locations set forth in Part 4.18
of Annex 3 attached hereto (or, in the case of collateral a Lien on which
must be perfected by possession, delivery of such collateral to the
Collateral Agent), the Collateral Agent will have a first-priority perfected
Lien in the SPV Collateral. No further action is required to establish a
valid and enforceable, first-priority Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) in
and to the SPV Collateral in favor of the Collateral Agent.

Section 4.19 Substantial Completion Date. The SPV has no reason
to believe that the Substantial Completion Date will not occur on or before

Section 4.20 Independent Engineer's Certificate. To the best of
the SPV's knowledge, the statements set forth in the Independent
Engineer's Certificate described in Section 5.7 are correct in all material
respects and the SPV is not aware of any fact which could reasonably be 
expected to make such statements materially untrue, incorrect or
incomplete.

Section 4.21 ERISA. 

a. Prohibited Transactions. Neither the execution of
any Transaction Document nor the purchase of the Construction Notes
by you will constitute a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code).
<PAGE> -13-<PAGE>
b. Compliance with ERISA. Each of the Corporation, Lime
and the SPV are in compliance with ERISA, except for such failures to
comply that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
prospects, profits, Properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of
such Persons or on the Project.

c. Funding Status. No "accumulated funding deficiency"
(as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the Code)

prospects, profits, Properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of
such Persons or on the Project. No circumstance exists that

to institute proceedings to terminate, or appoint a trustee to
administer, any Pension Plan or trust created thereunder, nor has
the PBGC instituted any such proceeding.

e. Multiemployer Plans. Neither the Corporation, Lime
or the SPV, nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or presently expects
to incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect
to any Multiemployer Plan that could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the business, prospects, profits,
Properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of such Persons or on
the Project. There have been no "reportable events" (as defined in
section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Multiemployer Plan that
could result in the termination of such Multiemployer Plan and give
rise to a liability of the Corporation, Lime or the SPV or any ERISA
Affiliate in respect thereof that could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects, profits,
Properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of such Persons or on
the Project.

at all times complied in all material respects with all Environmental Laws
and the requirements of any permits issued under such Environmental Laws
with respect to the Site and the Project. To the SPV's knowledge, there are
no circumstances that may hinder, delay, interfere with or prevent the
installation, ownership, construction, testing, maintenance and operation
of the Project or the use of the Site, as contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, in full compliance with applicable Environmental Laws. All
material Governmental Approvals required under Environmental Laws to
install, construct, test, maintain and operate the Project are completely
and accurately listed 
<PAGE> -14-<PAGE>
in Annex 4 hereto, together with the name in which such Governmental
Approval must be issued. Except as disclosed on Part 4.22 of Annex 3
hereto, there are no past, pending or, to the SPV's knowledge, threatened
Environmental Claims against Lime, the SPV, the Project, the Site or any of
the Black River Common Facilities. Since the Site has been owned by Lime
and, to the SPV's knowledge, before the Site was owned by Lime, Hazardous
Materials have not been generated, used, treated, located or stored on, or
transported to or from, the Site, the Black River Common Facilities or the
Project, and the SPV has not used, and does not intend to use, nor permit,
any portion of the Site, the Black River Common Facilities or the Project
for such purposes other than, in the case of any of the foregoing, (i) as
necessary to operate the Project and (ii) in compliance, in all material
respects, with all applicable Environmental Laws. Since the Site has been
owned by Lime and, to the SPV's knowledge, before the Site was owned by
Lime, Hazardous Materials have not at any time been released, deposited or
disposed of on or from the Site, the Black River Common Facilities or the
Project in any way contrary to that which is allowed under applicable
Environmental Laws. Except as disclosed on Part 4.22 of Annex 3 hereto,
there are no present or, to the best knowledge of the SPV, after due
inquiry, past actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or
incidents, including the release, emission, discharge, presence or disposal
of Hazardous Materials, that could (i) form the basis of an Environmental
Claim against Lime or the SPV, the Project, the Site or the Black River
Common Facilities, that individually or in the aggregate could have a
material adverse effect on the business, prospects, profits, Properties or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Lime, the SPV or the Project, (ii) cause
the Site, the Black River Common Facilities or the Project to be subject to
any restrictions on its ownership, occupancy, use or transferability under
any Environmental Laws, (iii) interfere with the continued use and
occupancy of the Site or the Black River Common Facilities or the
installation, construction, testing, maintenance or operation of the
Project, or (iv) prevent performance under the Transaction Documents.

never have been any underground storage tanks located on the Site.

Person authorized to act on behalf of any of such Persons (each, a "Lime
Offeror"), has offered directly or indirectly, any "security" within the
meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to the Project, the Construction
Notes or the Term Notes, as the case may be, for issue or sale to, or
solicited offers to acquire any thereof from, or otherwise approached or
negotiated with any Person other than an aggregate, for all the Lime
Offerors, of thirty (30) Accredited Investors (in addition to you), nor has
any Lime Offeror conducted any offering or solicitation which, for
purposes of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, would be deemed to be part of the offering or
solicitation described in the preceding sentence in violation of Section 5
of the Securities Act, and no Lime Offeror has taken or, on the Conversion
Date, will have taken, any action which would subject the issuance or sale
of any such security to the registration requirements of said Section 5.

Section 4.28 Other Business. The SPV has not engaged in any
business transaction unrelated to the development, construction,
ownership, operation, maintenance, and financing of the Project; and the
SPV is not a shareholder in any corporation or a partner, party or

coverage required by Section 12 hereof is in full force and effect. All
representations and warranties made by the SPV, Lime or their respective
authorized representatives to any insurer in connection with any
insurance required to be maintained by the SPV or Lime under any
Transaction Document were true, correct and complete in all material
respects when made.

Section 4.31 Financial Broker; Fees. Neither the SPV nor Lime has
retained any broker, finder or financial advisor, and neither of them is
liable for payment of any fee to any Person for brokerage or financial
advisory services rendered on its behalf, in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, except for the relationship between Lime and Continental Bank
Lease Capital Group. 

Section 4.32 The Project. The Project has been, and is being,
properly constructed on the Site in good and workmanlike manner and, in all
material respects, in accordance with the Plans and Specifications and
Applicable Law and in a manner that will allow it to be operated and
maintained in accordance with the Transaction Documents. The SPV has no
reason to believe that the Project does not or will not have the capacity
and functional ability to perform, on a continuous basis, the functions and
the capacity for which it was designed. The SPV is not aware of any event
or condition existing which presently adversely affects or is likely in the
future to adversely affect, such design, construction, equipping,
installation, operation or maintenance.

Section 4.33 Restrictive Agreements. The SPV is not a party to
any document, instrument, security, evidence of Debt or any other

leaseback 
<PAGE> -16-<PAGE>
transactions or dispose of assets, or which contains terms and provisions
which subject after-acquired Property of the SPV to any Lien.

Section 4.34 Sufficiency of Support Agreements. The rights to be
granted to the SPV pursuant to the Ground Lease, the Easement Agreement,
the MCFA and the other Transaction Documents are sufficient in the
aggregate to enable the SPV to occupy, use, possess, own, operate and
maintain on a commercially reasonable and economic basis (at Total Net
Capability) and possess the Site, the Project and the Black River Common
Facilities until the Term Note Maturity Date. The rights of the SPV under
the Ground Lease, the MCFA, and the Easement Agreement, which are the only
real property and other rights necessary for the construction, operation,
maintenance, repair, testing, use, possession and ownership of the Project,
have been validly obtained and are in full force and effect. The SPV does
not have any reason to believe that there will be contractual or, based
upon Applicable Law, other legal rights required for such occupancy, use,
possession, ownership, operation and maintenance of the Site, the Project
and the Black River Common Facilities, or that there will be other services
or materials required for such operation, maintenance, use, occupancy and
possession of the Site, the Project and the Black River Common Facilities,
other than those provided for under the Ground Lease, the Easement
Agreement and the MCFA.

eruption) and flood and providing coverage for (1) the Project in
a minimum aggregate amount equal to the "full insurable value"
of the Project, (2) transit, including ocean marine coverage if
applicable, with sub-limits sufficient to insure the full
replacement value of all property or equipment removed from
the Project and insurance coverage while located off the
Project, (3) electrical transmission lines along with related
equipment including transformers, electric motors and
electrical equipment, to the extent the SPV has an insurable
interest, (4) foundations and other property below the surface

may be incurred due to damage to the premises in a minimum

may also provide coverage for property damage and business
interruption resulting from damage or loss to the Project and
the Black River Facility caused by earth movement (including,
but not limited to, earthquake, landslide, subsidence and
volcanic eruption) and flood. For purposes of this Section
12(b)(i), "full insurable value" shall mean the full replacement
value of the Project, including any improvements, equipment,
fuel and supplies, without deduction for physical depreciation
and/or obsolescence. For all such insurance the deductible
shall not exceed $50,000, except for the earth movement and
flood coverage which shall have a deductible not exceeding
$500,000. Such insurance shall include an agreed amount
clause or waiver of coinsurance and provide for increased cost
of construction, debris removal, and loss to undamaged property
as the result of enforcement of building laws or ordinances
with sub-limits not less than 25% of the "full insurable value"
of the Project. The earth movement and flood coverages may be
insured with a sub-limit not less than 80% of the "full
insurable value" of the Project plus 80% of the Operating
Expense amount required by Section 12.1(b)(ii) below, but in no
case 
<PAGE> -44-<PAGE>

less than $50,000,000. The amount of physical damage and
business interruption insurance with regard to impact damage
to the docks located on the Easement Parcel shall be no less

interruption insurance covering continuing normal operating
expenses of the SPV including payroll and debt service
("Operating Expense") for a period of 12 months, arising from
damage or loss insured by Section 12.1(b)(i) above. The policy
providing such coverage shall have a maximum deductible of not
greater than 10 days or, in the case of flood, a deductible not
greater than $500,000. Such insurance shall also insure that
portion of fixed expenses and debt service not earned arising
from an insured loss or occurrence at the OPCO Gavin Power
Station and the underground property at the Black River
Facility for a period of four months. Such insurance shall
include either an agreed amount clause or waiver of
coinsurance.

(iii) Wharfingers Liability Insurance. Wharfingers
liability insurance covering liability arising out of the damage
to or destruction of barges and vessels owned by others and
the removal of wrecks with a $5,000,000 minimum limit per
occurrence.

(c) Endorsements. All policies of liability, physical damage and
business interruption insurance to be maintained by the SPV shall
provide for waivers of subrogation in favor of the Collateral Agent
and the Holders and their respective officers and employees (and
such other Persons as may be required by the Project Contracts). All
policies of liability insurance required to be maintained by the SPV
under this Section 12.1 shall be endorsed as follows:

(i) To provide a severability of interest or cross
liability clause;

(ii) That the insurance shall be primary and not excess
to or contributing with any insurance or self-insurance
maintained by the Collateral Agent or the Holders; and

(iii) To name the Collateral Agent and the Holders and
their respective officers and employees (and such other
Persons as may be required by the Project Contracts) as
additional insureds.

(d) Waiver of Subrogation. The SPV hereby waives any and
every claim for recovery from the Holders for any and all loss or
damage covered by any of the insurance policies to be maintained
under this Agreement to the extent that such loss or damage is
recovered under any such policy. Inasmuch as the foregoing waiver
will preclude the assignment of any such claim to the extent of such
recovery, by subrogation (or otherwise), to an insurance company (or
other Person), the SPV shall give written notice of the terms of such
waiver to each insurance company which has issued, or which may
issue in the future, any such policy of insurance (if such notice is
required by the insurance policy) and shall cause each such
insurance policy to be properly endorsed by the issuer thereof to, or
to otherwise contain one or more provisions that, prevent the
invalidation of the insurance coverage provided thereby by reason of
such waiver.
<PAGE> -45-<PAGE>
Section 12.2 Insurance By The Operator. The SPV shall cause the
Operator to procure at its own expense and to maintain in full force and
effect at all times that the Project is being operated, with responsible
insurance companies authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of
Kentucky with a Best Insurance Reports rating of "A-" or better and a
financial size category of "IX" or higher (except for other companies
acceptable to the Collateral Agent), with limits and coverage provisions
sufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in each of the Project
Contracts, but in no event less than the limits and coverage provisions set
forth below; however, the requirements of this Section 12.2 can also be
satisfied by naming the Operator as an insured on the insurance policies
procured by the SPV pursuant to the provisions of Section 12.1.

(a) General Liability Insurance. Liability insurance on an
occurrence basis against claims for personal injury (including bodily
injury and death) and property damage. Such insurance shall provide
coverage for products-completed operations, blanket contractual,
explosion, collapse and underground coverage, broad form property
damage, personal injury insurance, and hostile fire liability with a
$1,000,000 minimum limit per occurrence for combined bodily injury and
property damage, provided that policy aggregates, if any, shall apply
separately to claims occurring with respect to the Project. A maximum
self-insured retention or deductible of $250,000 shall be allowed.

(b) Automobile Liability Insurance. Automobile liability
insurance against claims for personal injury (including bodily injury
and death) or property damage arising out of the use of all owned,
leased, non-owned and hired motor vehicles, including loading and
unloading, with a $1,000,000 minimum limit per occurrence for combined
bodily injury and property damage and containing appropriate no-
fault insurance provisions where applicable. A maximum self-insured
retention or deductible of $100,000 shall be allowed.

(c) Workers' Compensation Insurance. Workers' compensation
insurance as required by applicable state laws, including employer's
liability insurance for all employees of the Operator with a
$1,000,000 minimum limit per accident, the policies with respect to
which shall include Longshoremen's and Harborworkers' Compensation
Act insurance.

(d) Excess Insurance. Excess liability insurance on an
occurrence basis covering claims in excess of the underlying
insurance described in the foregoing subsections (a), (b) and (c), with
a $19,000,000 minimum limit per occurrence, provided that aggregate
limits of liability, if any, shall apply separately to claims occurring
with respect to the Project.

The amounts of insurance required in the foregoing subsections (a),
(b), (c) and this subsection (d) may be satisfied by the Operator
purchasing coverage in the amounts specified or by any combination
thereof, so long as the total amount of insurance meets the
requirements specified above.

(e) Endorsements. All policies of liability insurance to be
maintained by the Operator shall provide for waivers of subrogation
in favor of the SPV, the Collateral Agent, the Holders and their
respective officers and employees (and such other Persons as may be
required by the Project Contracts). These policies shall also be
endorsed as follows:
<PAGE> -46-<PAGE>
(i) To provide a severability of interests or cross
liability clause;

(ii) That the insurance shall be primary and not excess
to or contributing with any insurance or self-insurance
maintained by the SPV, the Collateral Agent or the Holders; and

(iii) To name the SPV, the Collateral Agent, the Holders
and their respective officers and agents (and such other
Persons as may be required by the Project Contracts) as
additional insureds.

Section 12.3 Amendment of Requirements. The Collateral Agent may
at any time amend the requirements and approved insurance companies of
this Section 12 due to (i) new information not known by the Collateral Agent
on the Initial Funding Date or (ii) changed circumstances after the Initial
Funding Date which in the reasonable judgment of the Collateral Agent
either renders such coverage materially inadequate or materially reduces
the financial ability of the approved insurance companies to pay claims.

Section 12.4 Application of Proceeds. All insurance proceeds
recovered by the Collateral Agent as aforesaid on account of a Loss Event
shall be applied pursuant to Sections 11.3 and 11.4 of this Agreement. If the
aggregate damage or loss to (i) the Black River Facility and (ii) the Project
caused by an event of earth movement and/or flood is in excess of the
collectible insurance available to the SPV, the proceeds of the property
damage insurance paid out in respect of such event of earth movement
and/or flood shall be allocated proportionately to the Owner (or its
assigns) and to the SPV in the amounts which reflect the percentage of the
total loss attributable to the Black River Facility and the Project,
respectively. If the insurance policies providing coverage for earth
movement and flood also insure facilities other than the Project and the
Black River Facility, then the proceeds of the collectible property damage
insurance paid out in the event of damage or loss due to earth movement or
flood shall be allocated to the Project and the Black River Facility up to
100% of their loss or damage before any proceeds are allocated to the other
insured facilities.

Section 12.5 Conditions.

(a) The SPV shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent of any
loss covered by any insurance maintained pursuant to Section 12.1 or
Section 12.2.

(b) All policies of insurance required to be maintained
pursuant to Sections 12.1(a)(v) and (vi), (b)(i) and (ii), shall
provide that the proceeds of such policies shall be payable to the
Collateral Agent pursuant to a standard first mortgage endorsement
substantially equivalent to the lender loss payable endorsement
438BFU, without contribution; provided that if the proceeds thereof
are less than $250,000, such proceeds shall be paid to the SPV. The
Collateral Agent shall have the right to join the SPV in adjusting any
loss in excess of $250,000. All policies (other than in respect to
liability or workers' compensation insurance) shall insure the
interests of the Holders regardless of any breach or violation by the
SPV of warranties, declarations or conditions contained in such
policies, any action or inaction of the SPV or others, or any
foreclosure relating to the Project or any change in ownership of all
or any portion of the Project. All policies, other than workers'
compensation, shall waive any right of subrogation of the insurers as

<PAGE> -47-<PAGE>
against the SPV, the Holders or the Operator, and shall waive any
right of the insurers to any set off or counterclaim or any other
deduction (the foregoing may be accomplished by the use of the lender
loss payable endorsement required above).

(c) All policies of insurance required to be maintained
pursuant to this Section 12 shall be endorsed so that if at any time
should they be cancelled, or coverage be reduced which affects the
interests of the Holders, such cancellation or reduction shall not be
effective as to the Holders for 60 days, except for non-payment of
premium which shall be for 10 days, after receipt by the Collateral
Agent of written notice from such insurer of such cancellation or
reduction.

Section 12.6 Evidence of Insurance. On the Initial Funding Date
and on an annual basis at least 10 days prior to each policy anniversary,
the SPV shall furnish the Collateral Agent with approved certification of
all required insurance. Such certification shall be executed by each
insurer or by an authorized representative of each insurer where it is not
practical for such insurer to execute the certificate itself. Such
certification shall identify underwriters, the type of insurance, the
insurance limits and the policy term and shall specifically list the special
provisions enumerated for such insurance required by this Section 12. 
Upon request, the SPV will promptly furnish the Collateral Agent with copies
of all insurance policies, binders and cover notes or other evidence of
such insurance relating to the Project.

Section 12.7 Insurance Report. Concurrently with the furnishing
of the certification referred to in Section 12.6 and at least 10 days prior
to the expiration of any insurance policy required of the SPV, the SPV shall
furnish the Collateral Agent with a certificate signed by a Responsible
Officer of the SPV and by a Responsible Officer of the Insurance
Consultant stating that in the opinion of such Responsible Officer, the
insurance then carried or to be renewed is in accordance with the each
terms of this Section 12.

Section 12.8 Failure to Maintain Insurance. In the event the SPV
fails, or fails to cause the Operator, to take out or maintain the full
insurance coverage required by this Section 12, the Collateral Agent, upon
30 days' prior notice (unless the aforementioned insurance would lapse
within such period, in which event notice should be given as soon as
reasonably possible) to the SPV of any such failure, may (but shall not be
obligated to) take out the required policies of insurance and pay the
premiums on the same. All amounts so advanced in respect thereof by the
Collateral Agent shall become an additional obligation of the SPV to the
Collateral Agent, and the SPV shall forthwith pay such amounts to the
Collateral Agent, together with interest thereon at the Late Payment Rate
from the date so advanced.

Section 12.9 No Duty of the Collateral Agent to Verify. No
provision of this Section 12 or any other provision of this Agreement shall
impose on the Collateral Agent any duty or obligation to verify the
existence or adequacy of the insurance coverage maintained by the SPV,
nor shall the Collateral Agent be responsible for any representations or
warranties made by or on behalf of the SPV to any insurance company or
underwriter.

Section 12.10 Maintenance of Insurance. The SPV shall at all times
maintain the insurance coverage required under the terms of the Project
Contracts.
<PAGE> -48-<PAGE>

procure not later than 20 days following the Initial Funding Date the
following required insurance coverages:

for) is a valuable right, and that the provision for payment of a

Section 13.3 Remedies.

If an Event of Default exists, without limitation of any other rights

SPV Security Agreement, the Project Mortgage or any of the other

power or remedy, but shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right
or remedy hereunder or now or hereafter existing by law or in equity and
the exercise by a party hereto of any one or more of such rights, power or
remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous exercise of any or all of such
other rights, powers or remedies. Any failure to insist upon the strict
performance of any provision hereof or to exercise any option, right, power
or remedy contained herein shall not constitute a waiver or relinquishment
thereof for the future.

<PAGE> -57-<PAGE>
Section 17.2 General Indemnification. The SPV agrees (regardless
of whether (a) any of the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, (b) such Indemnitee shall also be indemnified as to such
Expense by any other Person (except to the extent the Indemnitee has
received payment from such other Person) or (c) such Expense arises or
accrues prior to the date of this Agreement), to defend, indemnify and make
whole each Indemnitee against, and to protect, save and keep harmless each
Indemnitee from, any and all Expenses that may be imposed on, incurred by
or asserted by any Person against, such Indemnitee, which Expenses are in
any way attributable or relating to or arising out of (i) the Project, the
Site, the MCFA, the Easement Agreement or any part thereof or interest
therein; (ii) any of the Transaction Documents (or any other agreement,
contract or instrument entered into in connection therewith or related
thereto) or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the exercise
by any Indemnitee of remedies thereunder, and (iii) the construction,
financing, acquisition, ownership, possession, use, regulation, operation,
maintenance and condition of all or any part of or any interest in the Site,
the Project or the Black River Common Facilities or the imposition of any
Lien thereon, including, in each case, without limitation (and whether the
subject of litigation or not) (but without duplication of any Construction
Costs or liquidated damages which Lime is obligated to pay): (A) claims or
penalties arising from any product liability, negligence, statutory liability
or violation of Applicable Law or in tort (strict, absolute or otherwise), (B)
Environmental Claims or other loss of or damage to any property or the
environment (including, without limitation, all Expenses associated with
remediation, response, removal, corrective action, financial assurance,
natural resource damages and the protection of wildlife, aquatic species
and vegetation, and any relevant mitigative action required under
applicable Environmental Laws), or death or injury to any Person, (C) latent
or other defects, whether or not discoverable, (D) the breach by Lime or the
SPV of any representations or warranties, or the failure by Lime or the
SPV to perform or observe any covenants or agreements, under any
Transaction Document (or any other agreement, contract or instrument
entered into in connection therewith or related thereto); and (E) any claim
for patent, trademark or copyright infringement; provided, however, that
the foregoing indemnity shall not extend to any Expense imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee to the extent the same (y)
constitutes an Expense which such Indemnitee is expressly liable for
payment of hereunder or under any other Transaction Document or (z)
relates to or arises the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such
Indemnitee or of its agents, officers, directors or employees.

If the SPV shall obtain knowledge of any Expense indemnified against
under this Section 17.2, it shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
appropriate Indemnitee or Indemnitees, and if any Indemnitee shall obtain
any such knowledge, such Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the SPV, but failure of any Indemnitee to give notice shall not
affect the obligations of the SPV in respect thereof. With respect to any
Expense that the SPV is requested by an Indemnitee to pay by reason of
this Section 17.2, such Indemnitee shall, if so requested by the SPV and
prior to any payment, submit such additional information to the SPV as the
SPV may reasonably request to substantiate the requested payment.

In case any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against any
Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify the SPV of the
commencement thereof (but the failure to do so shall not relieve the SPV of
its obligation to indemnify such Indemnitee except to the extent that the
SPV is prejudiced as a result of such failure), and the SPV, so long as no
Default or Event of Default shall have then occurred and be continuing,
shall be entitled, at its expense, acting through counsel reasonably
acceptable to such Indemnitee, to participate in, and, to the extent 
<PAGE> -58-<PAGE>
that the SPV desires (if the SPV has acknowledged in writing its obligations
hereunder to indemnify fully such Indemnitee with respect to all such
Expenses under this Section 17.2) to assume and control the defense
thereof; provided, however, that the SPV shall not be entitled to assume
and control the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding if and to the
extent that, in the reasonable discretion of such Indemnitee, (i) such
action, suit or proceeding involves the possible imposition of criminal
liability on such Indemnitee, (ii) such action, suit or proceeding involves a
reasonable likelihood of the imposition of civil liability on such Indemnitee
which the SPV is not obligated to indemnify hereunder, (iii) such Indemnitee
determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it may raise a defense or
defenses which is or are unavailable to the SPV or different from the
defenses available to the SPV in such action, suit or proceeding, (iv) such
control and assumption, in the reasonable discretion of such Indemnitee,
involves a conflict of interest between such Indemnitee and the SPV or any
other Indemnitee with respect to such action or proceeding, or (v) such
action, suit or proceeding entails a reasonable possibility of compromising
or jeopardizing a substantial interest of such Indemnitee; and in any such
event such Indemnitee may retain additional and separate counsel to
represent it or, at its option, assume the defense of such action and the
SPV will pay all of the Expenses of such Indemnitee in respect of such
defense, provided that if the SPV shall not elect in writing to assume the
defense thereof to the extent entitled to do so, an Indemnitee may, after
written notice to the SPV and after the SPV's failure to remedy promptly
the same, assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel,
in which case the SPV shall pay all of the Expenses of such Indemnitee
incurred in respect of such defense. An Indemnitee shall, in any case, be
entitled, at its expense, to participate in any action, suit or proceeding the
defense of which has been assumed by the SPV; provided however, that if
the SPV fails to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee
the fees and expenses of counsel to such Indemnitee shall be paid by the
SPV.

No Indemnitee shall enter into any settlement or other compromise
with respect to any Expense without the prior written consent of the SPV
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such
Indemnitee waives its right to be indemnified under this Section 17.2 with
respect to such Expense or an Event of Default shall have then occurred
and be continuing. In any action, suit or proceeding to which any Indemnitee
is a party, the SPV shall not enter into any settlement or other compromise
with respect to any Expense without the prior written consent of such
Indemnitee which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Upon payment of any Expense by the SPV pursuant to this Section 17.2
to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, the SPV, without any further action, shall
be subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee may have to
recover such Expense from any other Person (other than claims in respect
of insurance policies maintained by such Indemnitee at its own expense),
and such Indemnitee shall cooperate with the SPV and give such further
assurances as are reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the SPV to
pursue such claims; provided that the SPV's rights of subrogation shall be
subordinated to the full and complete payment of all principal, interest,
Make-Whole Amount and other amounts due with respect to the Notes.

Nothing in this Section 17.2 shall be construed as a guaranty by the
SPV of any residual or market value in the Project, the Project Land or of
the performance capability or operating capacity of the Project or as a
guaranty of any Notes.

Section 17.3 Increased Costs. If,

requirement or request after the date hereof from any Governmental
Authority, whether or not having the force of law, with which such
Holder must reasonably comply (including, without limitation the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners); or

(ii) the change in the interpretation or application of any law
or the enactment of any law after the date hereof imposing or
modifying any reserve requirement (including, without limitation, any
requirement of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners),
capital adequacy requirement or similar requirement with respect to
any class of assets or liabilities of, deposits with or for the account
of, or loans or investments by, any Holder (or with respect to any
change therein or in the amount thereof); or

(iii) the occurrence after the date hereof of any other
condition or circumstance (other than conditions or circumstances
relating only to such Holder and arising solely as a result of an
exercise of discretion by such Holder) with respect to this Agreement
and/or the maintenance by such Holder of its investment in the Notes,

shall (A) result in any increase in cost to any Holder in connection with or
arising out of any Note, (B) result in any reduction in the amount of any
payment receivable by any Holder hereunder or thereunder or (C) result in
any reduction of the rate of the return on any Holder's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder below that which such Holder
could have achieved but for such circumstances, then, in each such case,
the SPV shall fully reimburse such Holder the amount of such increase in
cost, reduction in payment receivable or reduction in rate of return
promptly after written notification thereof to the SPV by such Holder,
which notification shall include such Holder's relevant calculations and all
relevant additional facts, assumptions and information that such Holder
customarily provides in like circumstances. The Holders shall (consistent
with their internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) use
their reasonable efforts to avoid such increased costs by giving the SPV
prompt notice thereof.

If at any time a Holder gives notice that any amount is due under this
Section 17.3, the SPV shall, for a thirty (30) day period following receipt of
such notice, have the right to prepay such Holder's Notes at par (without
any payment of the Make-Whole Amount).

Section 17.4 Restriction on Sale of Notes. So long as no Default
or Event of Default shall exist, no Holder shall sell any Note to (a) any
Person engaged in a business substantially similar to that of Lime on the
Initial Funding Date, or (b) any electric utility company.

Section 17.5 Disclosure to Other Persons. Each Holder shall use
its best efforts to hold in confidence and not to disclose any Confidential
Information, provided, that any Holder will be free, after notice to the SPV,
to correct any false or misleading information that may become public
concerning its relationship to the SPV or Lime or to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SPV
acknowledges that any Holder may deliver copies of any financial
statements and other documents delivered to such Holder, and disclose any
other information disclosed to such Holder (including, without limitation,
Confidential Information), by or on behalf of the SPV in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement, to
<PAGE> -60-<PAGE>
(a) such Holder's directors, officers, employees, agents and
professional consultants,

(b) any other Holder,

(c) any Institutional Investor to which such Holder sells or
offers to sell such Note or any part thereof, provided that such
Institutional Investor signs a written agreement to comply with the
confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, regardless of whether
or not such offeree purchases any Notes, and provided further that
no such agreement shall be required so long as such Institutional
Investor is furnished only with information that is not Confidential
Information,

(d) any Institutional Investor to which such Holder sells or
offers to sell a participation in all or any part of such Note,
provided that such Institutional Investor signs a written agreement
to comply with the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement,
regardless of whether or not such offeree purchases any Notes, and
provided further that no such agreement shall be required so long as
such Institution Investor is furnished only with information that is
not Confidential Information,

(e) any federal or state regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over such Holder,

(f) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or
any similar organization or

(g) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may

Holder is a party.

The SPV agrees and stipulates that any such 
<PAGE> -61-<PAGE>
reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any
judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by such Holder in
the regular course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or
further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in
evidence.

Section 17.7 Payments on Notes; other Amounts.

(a) Manner of Payment. The SPV shall make each payment of
principal, interest, Make-Whole Amount and all other amounts due with
respect to each Note (without any presentment of such Notes and
without any notation of such payment being made thereon) by
crediting, by federal funds bank wire transfer, your account
designated on Annex 1 prior to noon New York City time on the date
such payment is due. 

(b) Payments Due on Holidays. If any payment due on, or with
respect to, any Note shall fall due on a day other than a Business
Day, then such payment shall be made on the first Business Day
following the day on which such payment shall have so fallen due;
provided that if all or any portion of such payment shall consist of a
payment of interest, for purposes of calculating such interest, such
payment shall be deemed to have been originally due on such first
following Business Day, such interest shall accrue and be payable to
(but not including) the actual date of payment, and the amount of the
next succeeding interest payment shall be adjusted accordingly. If
any payment is to be made on the first Business Day following the day
on which the same shall have fallen due, as provided in this
paragraph, and is not so paid on such first Business Day, interest
shall accrue thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) with
respect to each Note at the rate provided in such Note on overdue
payments of principal from (in each case) the originally scheduled day
of its payment.

(c) Payments, When Received. Any payment to be made to any
Holders shall be deemed to have been made on the Business Day such
payment actually becomes available to such Holder at such Holder's
bank prior to noon (New York City time).

(d) Other Amounts. Any fees, expenses, costs and other
amounts due from the SPV to you pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document which are not paid when due shall bear
interest thereafter at a rate per annum equal to the Late Payment
Rate.

Section 17.8 Survival. All warranties, representations,
certifications and covenants made by the SPV herein or in any certificate
or other instrument delivered by it or on its behalf under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document shall be considered to have been relied
upon by you and shall survive the delivery to you of the Notes regardless
of any investigation made by you or on your behalf. All statements in any
such certificate or other instrument shall constitute warranties and
representations by the SPV hereunder.

Section 17.9 Successors and Assigns. The SPV may not assign any
of its interests, rights or obligations hereunder without your prior written
consent. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the successors and permitted assigns of each of the parties hereto. The
provisions of this Agreement are intended to be for the benefit of all
Holders 
<PAGE> -62-<PAGE>
and shall be enforceable by any such Holder, whether or not an express
assignment to such Holder of rights under this Agreement has been made by
you or your successor or assign.

Section 17.10 Amendments. The provisions of this Agreement may
not be waived, modified, amended, supplemented or terminated in any manner
whatsoever except by written instrument signed by each party against
which enforcement or applicability of the waiver, modification, amendment,
supplement or termination is sought. 

Section 17.11 Section Headings, Table of Contents. The titles of
the Sections and the Table of Contents appear as a matter of convenience
only, do not constitute a part hereof and shall not affect the construction
hereof. The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and "hereto" refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section or other
subdivision.

Section 17.12 Duplicate Originals; Execution in Counterpart. Two or
more duplicate originals of this Agreement may be signed by the parties,
each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts and will be effective when at least one
counterpart has been executed and delivered by each party hereto; and
each set of counterparts which, collectively, shows execution by all of the
parties hereto shall constitute one duplicate original.

Section 17.13 Jury Trial Waiver. NEITHER THE SPV NOR THE
PURCHASER (NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS) SHALL SEEK A
JURY TRIAL IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE FINANCING DOCUMENTS, ANY COLLATERAL FOR THE
INDEBTEDNESS EVIDENCED BY THE NOTES, OR THEIR DEALINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
EACH OTHER, AND EACH OF THEM AGREE THAT NO SUCH ACTION WITH RESPECT TO WHICH A
JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED SHALL BE SOUGHT TO BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ANY OTHER
ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. THIS PARAGRAPH
HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY THE SPV AND YOU, EACH OF WHOM HAVE BEEN
REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, AND THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY
EXCEPTIONS.

MASTER COMMON FACILITIES AGREEMENT

MASTER COMMON FACILITIES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of
August 1, 1994, between DRAVO LIME COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, as
Owner and Operator, and DRAVO BLACK RIVER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware
limited partnership.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

1. Pursuant to the Ground Lease the SPV will acquire from Lime a
leasehold interest in the Project Land. The SPV desires to complete
construction of the Project upon the Site. Lime has assigned to the SPV
its rights under the Construction Contracts. In addition, the SPV has
appointed Lime to act as construction manager of the Project pursuant to
the Construction Management Agreement.

2. Lime, as owner of the Black River Facility (together with its
successors and permitted assigns as owner of the Black River Facility, in
such capacity, the "Owner"), desires (i) to provide certain facility
support and services and to supply limestone and other necessary items to
the Project and (ii) to serve as initial Operator of the Project.

3. In exchange therefor and for other good and valuable consideration,
the SPV wishes to grant to the Owner the right to use the Project for the
processing of the Owner's limestone and the handling and storage of
processed lime.

4. The parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement, the Ground
Lease and various other Transaction Documents to establish their
respective rights and obligations in respect of the foregoing
arrangements. For purposes of this Agreement, capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned
to them in Annex A to the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 1,
1994, between the SPV and the Lender. The rules of usage set forth in
such Annex A shall apply hereto.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROJECT

1.1 Appointment of the Operator. The SPV hereby appoints Lime as
sole operator of the Project (such sole Operator, in such capacity,
together with its successors and permitted assigns, being herein referred
to as the "Operator") from and after the date hereof until the termination
of this Agreement or until Lime shall have been removed in accordance with
Section 1.10. Lime hereby agrees to serve as the initial Operator on the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.
<PAGE> -1-<PAGE>

1.2 Operational Responsibilities and Obligations of the Operator.

(a) The Operator shall be responsible for providing all work and
services with respect to the start-up, operation and maintenance of the
Project and the operation and maintenance of the Black River Common
Facilities as set forth in Schedule 1 and the other provisions of this
Agreement (the "Operating Work"). Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the Operator, in performing its duties
hereunder, is acting as an independent contractor.

(b) Subject to Section 1.3, the Operator may enter into such
agreements or subcontracts as the Operator, in compliance with Prudent
Industry Practice, deems necessary or appropriate, or as may be
required by Applicable Law, with respect to the Operating Work. If any
such agreement or subcontract (or modification thereof), except for any
collective bargaining agreement, shall provide for the payment of more
than $100,000 by any party thereto or shall refer to the SPV, the
Lender or the Collateral Agent, such agreement or subcontract (or
modification thereof) shall expressly provide that it does not impose
on the SPV or any other party to a Transaction Document (other than the
Operator) any obligation, liability or duty to any contractor or
subcontractor or create any contractual relationship between any
contractor or subcontractor and the SPV or any other party to a
Transaction Document (other than the Operator).

(c) In fulfilling its obligations under this Article 1, the
Operator shall not, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein
(including Section 1.9 and Section 3.1(b) hereof), be required to take
any action that would have the effect of discriminating against the
Black River Facility or any other lime production facility owned by it
or any of its Affiliates, or in the use of the Project or the Black
River Common Facilities in connection therewith. In addition, the
Operator shall not take any action in connection with the operation of
the Black River Processing Complex or any other lime production
facility owned by it or any of its Affiliates that would have the
effect of discriminating against the Project. For purposes of this
Section 1.2(c), "discriminating" means providing available supplies
and/or services on any basis other than ratably, in accordance with
then applicable production or maintenance requirements, among the
Project and all lime production facilities operated by the Operator
capable of servicing Compatible Lime Supply Agreements.

1.3 Matters Requiring Approval. The Operator shall not take any
action with respect to the Project except as set forth in Section 1.2 or
in the Easement Agreement. In any case, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Operator shall not take any of the
following actions without the prior written consent of the SPV:

(a) any action the effect of which may be to reduce the
production level at which the Project is capable of being operated for 
Capability as of the Conversion Date unless such action is in
consequence of an Operating Emergency as to which (i) the Operator
shall have given the SPV, the Lender and the Independent Engineer
notice setting forth the details of such Operating Emergency within 48
hours after the occurrence of such event or circumstance ("Emergency
Notice") and (ii) within one week after receipt of the Emergency Notice
by the Independent Engineer, the Independent Engineer shall have agreed
that such reduction in production level is, consistent with Prudent
Industry Practice, necessary to 
<PAGE> -2-<PAGE>
avoid or alleviate such Operating Emergency; provided, however, that
any such reduction on account of an Operating Emergency shall be
permitted for only such period of time as the Independent Engineer, in
consultation with the Operator, shall deem appropriate, in accordance
with Prudent Industry Practice;

(b) make any Capital Additions or Modifications, or any
adjustments, alterations or other physical changes to the Project (i)
the effect of which may be to reduce the Total Net Capability of the
Project or (ii) which may be inconsistent with the obligations of the
SPV under the Note Purchase Agreement (as in effect on the Initial
Funding Date); provided, however, that in the case of any Capital
Additions or Modifications, or any adjustment, alteration or other
physical change of any kind whatsoever, which is consented to in
writing by the SPV, the costs thereof shall not constitute Operation
and Maintenance Costs, or be paid with Project Revenues, unless
otherwise agreed in writing by the SPV; and provided, further, that no
Capital Additions or Modifications or any adjustment, alteration or
other physical change shall be made to the Project-Owned Common
Facilities which could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Black River Facility without the prior written
consent of the holders of 66-2/3% in principal amount of the Existing
Creditors Indebtedness;

(c) any action the effect of which could reasonably be expected
to cause a Permanent Shutdown to occur;

(d) settlement of any dispute with a contractor or supplier in
respect of goods or services contracted for by the Operator hereunder,
if the amount involved is in excess of $250,000;

(e) other than for Operating Emergencies which are governed by
Section 1.3(a), any action to take the Project out of service for any
continuous period that (i) exceeds one week, (ii) when combined with
all periods of voluntary outage of the Project not requiring consent
under this Section 1.3(e) which shall have occurred in the 12-month
period immediately preceding the date of any such action, would exceed
in the aggregate three weeks, (iii) is not permitted pursuant to
Section 1.5 or (iv) constitutes a Permanent Shutdown;

(f) the adoption of any Project Budget or Extended Budget, and
any changes to either thereof; or

(g) make any material substitution, replacement or repair of any
part or equipment incorporated into the Project.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scheduled recurring capital
expenditures referred to on Schedule 2 hereto shall constitute Operation
and Maintenance Costs.

1.4 Operation and Maintenance Costs; Budget.

(a) (i) At least 60 days prior to the beginning of each
Contract Year, the Operator shall prepare and submit to the SPV,
the Independent Engineer, the Existing Creditors, the Lender and
the Owner, (A) a draft line item budget (the 
<PAGE> -3-<PAGE>
"Draft Project Budget") setting forth by category the Operator's
projections of the cost of operating the Project during the
upcoming Contract Year, on a month by month basis, (B) detailed
backup information sufficient to permit an informed review of
such Draft Project Budget, and (C) the levels of projected lime
purchases provided to the SPV by OPCO pursuant to Article III(c)
of the OPCO Agreement. Each Draft Project Budget and each
Project Budget shall contain a separate line item for the costs
of coal/petroleum coke, electricity, insurance, property taxes,
labor, scheduled recurring capital expenses, and Other Costs
based upon the projected levels of lime purchases provided to the
SPV by OPCO pursuant to Article III(c) of the OPCO Agreement, all
as more fully set forth on Schedule 2 hereto. No Draft Project
Budget or Project Budget shall provide for any Capital Additions
or Modifications or any other items requiring prior written
consent pursuant to Section 1.3 (unless such consent shall be
granted).

(ii) Within 45 days after its receipt of a Draft Project
Budget for any Contract Year, the SPV and the Lender shall give
written notice to the Operator that such Draft Project Budget has
been approved or disapproved by the SPV and the Lender. If such
Draft Project Budget shall be disapproved, the Operator shall in
good faith propose modifications thereto until such Draft Project
Budget, as so modified, shall be approved. If the Operator, the
SPV and the Lender cannot agree on a Draft Project Budget for any
Contract Year, such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 5.2.

(iii) Not later than the first day of any Contract Year,
the Operator shall submit to the SPV, the Independent Engineer,
the Lender, the Existing Creditors, the Disbursement Agent and
the Owner a final project budget (the "Project Budget") which
shall be the same as the Draft Project Budget in respect of such
Contract Year that has been approved by the SPV and the Lender,
with only such changes therein as shall not, without the prior
written consent of the SPV and the Lender (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), add or delete any line item set
forth in such Draft Project Budget or increase or decrease any
line item amount set forth in such Draft Project Budget by more
than 2%; provided that, if no Draft Project Budget has been
approved by the SPV and the Lender by the first day of any
Contract Year, a Draft Project Budget for such Contract Year that
is so approved subsequent to such date shall be the Project
Budget for such Contract Year with no modifications therein that
are not approved by the SPV and the Lender.

(iv) The Operator shall not make any expenditure in
respect of Operation and Maintenance Costs for any Contract Year
except (subject to Section 1.4(c)) pursuant to a Project Budget
that has been submitted to the SPV and the Lender in accordance
with the foregoing clause (iii) (unless any such expenditure is
to be made at a time when a Project Budget for such time has not
been approved, in which event such expenditure shall be made
pursuant to the Extended Budget applicable to such time, if any).

(v) No later than 60 days after the end of each Contract
Year, the Operator shall, in compliance with accepted financial
practice and Prudent 
<PAGE> -4-<PAGE>
Industry Practice, prepare and submit to the SPV, the Lender and
the Independent Engineer an item by item reconciliation (rounded
to the nearest $1,000) of the previous Contract Year's Project
Budget and the actual Operation and Maintenance Costs for such
Contract Year, together with an explanation, in reasonable
detail, of the principal causes of any variances of more than
$50,000 from the Project Budget.

(b) Not later than June 1 of each year, the Operator shall
prepare and submit to the SPV, the Independent Engineer, the Existing
Creditors, the Disbursement Agent, the Lender and the Owner

(i) a proposed line item budget (as finally approved as
provided in this paragraph (b), the "Extended Budget") setting
forth by category the Operator's projections of the cost of
operating the Project during the 12 consecutive months ending on
June 30 of the following year, on a month by month basis, 

(ii) detailed backup information sufficient to permit an
informed review of such proposed Extended Budget, and 

(iii) the levels of projected lime purchases by OPCO
during the twelve month period beginning on July 1 of such year,
based upon:

(A) with respect to the first six months of such
period, the levels of projected lime purchases provided to the
SPV by OPCO pursuant to Article III (c) of the OPCO Agreement,
and

(B) with respect to the final six months of such
period the Operator's best estimate of OPCO purchases
based upon all of the facts known to the Operator at
such time.

Each Extended Budget shall contain a separate line item for the costs of
coal/petroleum coke, electricity, insurance, property taxes, labor,
scheduled recurring capital expenses, and Other Costs based upon the
projected levels of lime purchases provided to the SPV by OPCO pursuant to
Article III(c) of the OPCO Agreement, all as more fully set forth on
Schedule 2 hereto. Within 45 days after its receipt of a proposed
Extended Budget for any period, the SPV and the Lender shall give written
notice to the Operator that such proposed Extended Budget has been
approved or disapproved by the SPV and the Lender. If such proposed
Extended Budget shall be disapproved, the Operator shall in good faith
propose modifications thereto until an Extended Budget, as so modified,
shall be approved (at which time copies of such approved Extended Budget
shall be delivered to the SPV, the Independent Engineer, the Existing
Creditors, the Disbursement Agent, the Lender and the Owner). If the
Operator, the SPV and the Lender cannot agree on an Extended Budget for
any period, such disagreement shall be resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 5.2. The Extended Budget shall only be
used for purposes of determining deposit and disbursement obligations
under Section 2.4 of the Deposit and Disbursement Agreement and for the
purposes set forth in Section 1.4(a)(iv) and Section 1.4(c).
<PAGE> -5-<PAGE>
(c) The Operator shall make all expenditures of Operation and
Maintenance Costs, consistent with Prudent Industry Practice and the
then current Project Budget, in the normal course of business and as
necessary or advisable for the performance of the Operating Work;
provided, however, that:

(i) subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) below, if such
expenditures by the Operator in any Contract Year would, when
taken together with all other such expenditures for such Contract
Year, exceed any applicable line item amount in the Project
Budget for such Contract Year (or the relevant Extended Budget,
if applicable), the Operator shall give the SPV, the Lender and
the Independent Engineer prompt notice of such fact;

(ii) subject to clause (iii) below, the Operator may not,
without the prior written consent of the SPV and the Lender, make
any expenditure (A) in any month, if such expenditure together
with all other similar expenditures in such month would exceed
the line item amount applicable to such expenditure in the
Project Budget (or the Extended Budget, if applicable) for such
month by 10% or more, or (B) in any Contract Year, if such
expenditure together with all other expenditures made in such
Contract Year at or prior to such time would exceed by 5% or more
the total expenditures in the Project Budget (or the Extended
Budget, if applicable) for such portion of such Contract Year;

(iii) the restrictions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above
shall not apply if (A) an Operating Emergency shall have
occurred; (B) the Operator shall have given the SPV and the
Independent Engineer an Emergency Notice within 48 hours after
the occurrence of such Operating Emergency; and (C) such
expenditures are necessary, consistent with Prudent Industry
Practice, within such 48-hour period to avoid or alleviate such
Operating Emergency; no such expenditures shall be made after
such 48-hour period without the prior written consent of the SPV;

(iv) the restrictions set forth in clause (ii) above shall not
apply to the line item amounts for coal/petroleum coke,
electricity and Other Costs if the number of tons of processed
lime produced by the Project in any month or in any Contract Year
is more than the number of tons projected by the Project Budget
or the Extended Budget, as the case may be, for such period;
provided, however, that any increase in any such line item
amount, as set forth in the Project Budget or the Extended
Budget, as the case may be, shall not exceed a percentage of such
line item amount equal to the percentage increase in the number
of tons of lime produced by the Project during such month or
Contract Year, as the case may be, over the number of tons
projected to be so produced during such period in the Project
Budget or the Extended Budget, as the case may be; and

(v) the restriction set forth in clause (ii)(A) above shall not
apply to any scheduled recurring capital expenditure.

All such expenditures incurred by the Operator in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the preceding
proviso), and all expenditures for 
<PAGE> -6-<PAGE>
material substitutions, replacements or repairs of parts or equipment
incorporated into the Project with the prior written consent of the
SPV, shall be binding upon the SPV and shall constitute Operation and
Maintenance Costs for all purposes hereunder. Expenditures (that are
made with the prior written consent of the SPV) in respect of Capital
Additions or Modifications, or adjustments, alterations or other
physical changes to the Project, shall not constitute Operation and
Maintenance Costs for any purpose hereunder unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the SPV. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scheduled
recurring capital expenditures referred to on Schedule 2 hereto shall
constitute Operation and Maintenance Costs.

(d) All payments of Operation and Maintenance Costs shall be
made in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(ii)(A) of the Deposit and
Disbursement Agreement. In the event that the Disbursement Agent fails
to make all or a portion of the disbursement required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii)(A) of the Deposit and Disbursement
Agreement, or the amount of such disbursement is insufficient to pay
all Operation and Maintenance Costs then due and payable and the SPV
(or any Person on behalf of the SPV, as provided in the Transaction
Documents) has not paid to the Disbursement Agent or the Operator an
amount equal to such shortfall, then the Operator shall advance the
amount of such disbursement or portion thereof (including all amounts
due to the Owner hereunder) and shall continue to perform the Operating
Work. If the Disbursement Agent has not fully repaid the amounts owing
to the Operator under this Section 1.4(d) with respect to an advance
under this Section 1.4(d) by the close of business on the first
Business Day after the 60th day following the date on which the advance
was made, the Operator shall not have any further obligation to advance
additional funds pursuant to this Section 1.4(d) or to continue to
perform the Operating Work and the SPV shall remain obligated to repay
such advances; provided, however, that the Operator shall not institute
legal proceedings to recover such advances from the SPV, except to the
extent provided in Section 5.10, unless and until the Secured
Obligations have been paid in full. Except as provided in this Section
1.4(d), the Operator shall not be required to advance funds to the SPV
or the Owner in order to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement.

1.5 Outages. At the same time the Project Budget is delivered
pursuant to Section 1.4(a), the Operator shall deliver to the SPV and the
Independent Engineer a schedule (the "Outage Schedule") of all planned
outages (including those for inspection and ordinary maintenance of the
Project) for such Contract Year. The Operator shall, to the extent
practicable, adhere to such Outage Schedule during such Contract Year. 
The scheduling and carrying out of such outages shall be (i) to the extent
consistent with clauses (iii) and (iv) below, made on a nondiscriminatory
basis with respect to the Black River Facility, (ii) to the extent
consistent with clauses (iii) and (iv) below, coordinated with the
Operator's other plant maintenance outages in accordance with Prudent
Industry Practice, (iii) coordinated with OPCO and any other purchasers of
processed lime from the SPV to minimize any interruption in the supply of
processed lime that is to be delivered to OPCO pursuant to the OPCO
Agreement, to the purchasers under Economically Similar Contracts, and to
the purchasers under the other lime supply contracts to which the SPV may,
from time to time, be a party (with the consent of the Existing Creditors)
and (iv) made in accordance with Prudent Industry Practice to minimize
both interruptions to the operation of the Project and the Black River
Facility and any loss of profits as a result of the timing of such
interruptions. In the event of an Operating Emergency or any other
emergency 
<PAGE> -7-<PAGE>
outage, forced outage, or reduction in production below a Total Net
Capability of at least 650,000 tons per annum for any reason, the Operator
shall schedule and perform all required repairs and replacements, and
restore production to a Total Net Capability of at least 650,000 tons per
annum, in an expeditious manner in accordance with Prudent Industry
Practice and the other requirements of this Agreement.

1.6 Books and Records; Reports.

(a) The Operator shall keep all necessary books of record, books of
account and memoranda of all transactions referred to in this Article 1
involving the Project, including, without limitation, of the services
provided and the funds received and expended by the Operator in the
course of performing the Operating Work. Such books of record, books
of account and memoranda shall be kept by the Operator in such manner
as to conform to GAAP and to all Applicable Laws. The Operator shall,
if it owns and/or is operating or is otherwise involved with the Black
River Facility, keep separate books of record, books of account and
memoranda of transactions for each of the Project and the Black River
Facility.

(b) The Operator shall prepare and, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, file in a timely fashion; or, if the SPV shall be
required to so file, the Operator shall prepare and deliver to the SPV
within a reasonable time prior to the date for filing, all reports with
respect to the Project or the Black River Facility, or the condition or
operation thereof, that shall be required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority.

(c) The Operator shall, not later than 20 days after the end of each
calendar month, prepare and deliver a report to the SPV (with copies to
the Lender and the Independent Engineer) setting forth the monthly and
annual cumulative output, the production levels, the variance from
forecast, and a description of outages and operating hours for the
Project. In addition, the Operator shall prepare and deliver such
other reports as the SPV or the Lender may reasonably request.

(d) The Operator shall, not later than 60 days after the end of each
Project Quarter, prepare and deliver a report to the SPV (with copies
to the Lender and the Independent Engineer) summarizing the operating
and maintenance costs and revenues for such Project Quarter, which
report shall provide a breakdown of Operation and Maintenance Costs.

1.7 Inspection Rights. Upon reasonable notice to the Operator, during
normal business hours, the SPV, the Lender, the Existing Creditors and
their respective representatives shall, subject to customary
confidentiality and safety procedures, have (i) access to the Project and
the Black River Facility for purposes of the inspection thereof and (ii)
the right to inspect the books of record, books of account and memoranda
of the Operator relating to the Project and the Black River Facility, to
make copies and extracts therefrom (other than copies of and extracts from
proprietary data and information) and to discuss with the executive
officers of the Operator the finances and accounts relating to the Project
and the Black River Facility and, with respect to the operations of the
Project, the senior technical employees of the Operator. The Operator
will cooperate with such Persons in connection with any such inspection or
discussion. Such inspection and copying shall be solely at the expense of
the Person requesting the same, unless 
<PAGE> -8-<PAGE>
done in connection with the removal of the Operator (in which case such
inspection shall be at the sole expense of the Operator).

1.8 Annual Audit. The books, records and accounts of Operation and
Maintenance Costs maintained by the Operator pursuant to Section 1.6 shall
be subject to an audit as of the end of and for each Contract Year by KPMG
Peat Marwick or another firm of nationally recognized independent public
accountants selected by the Operator. The SPV, the Lender and the
Existing Creditors, and any of their respective representatives, shall be
permitted to check and review all accounting records relating to the
operation of the Project and the Black River Facility and to observe the
procedures followed by the Operator's accountants. The report of such
firm of independent public accountants for such Contract Year shall be
submitted to the Operator, with a copy to the SPV, each Existing Creditor
and the Lender within 90 days after the end of such Contract Year. The
cost of such annual audit shall constitute an Operation and Maintenance
Cost.

1.9 Uncontrollable Forces. The Operator shall not be considered to be
in default in the performance of any of its obligations under this Article
1, other than obligations to pay money, if (a) such failure of performance
shall be due to Uncontrollable Forces and (b) the obligations of the
"Producer" are similarly excused under the OPCO Agreement as well as under
any Economically Similar Contract and each and every other contract to
supply processed lime to which the SPV is then a party; provided, that the
Operator agrees that if such Uncontrollable Forces arise as a result of
the unavailability of the Operator's personnel, the SPV may hire such
personnel as may be necessary to permit operation and maintenance of the
Project to the extent consistent with applicable law. If the Operator is
rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of Uncontrollable
Forces, it shall give prompt notice of such fact to the SPV (with copies
to the Lender and the Independent Engineer) and shall exercise reasonable
diligence to remove said inability with all reasonable dispatch. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed to require a party to settle any
strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved.

1.10 Removal of Operator.

(a) So long as any of the Secured Obligations shall remain
outstanding, Lime shall be subject to removal as Operator by the Lender
or the Collateral Agent if:

(i) 45 days' prior written notice of such removal has been
provided to Lime and the Existing Creditors' Agent by the Lender
or the Collateral Agent, and

(ii) (A) either

(1) Lime, as Operator, shall have failed to perform or
observe any covenants or agreements to be performed or
observed by it, as Operator, under Section 1.3 hereof;

(2) Lime, as Owner, shall have failed to perform or
observe any covenant or agreement to be performed or
observed by it under Section 2.1, Section 2.2, Section
2.5, Section 3.1(b), Section 3.1(c) or Section 3.2, and
such failure shall have continued, after 
<PAGE> -9-<PAGE>
Lime has been given a notice specifying such failure
and requiring such failure to be remedied, for a period
of 10 days;

(3) an Event of Default under the Note Purchase
Agreement (as in effect on the Initial Funding Date)
shall exist; or

(4)(I) Lime shall have failed to perform or observe
any other covenant or agreement to be performed or
observed by it, as either Owner or Operator, under this
Agreement or in any capacity under any other
Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the
failure referred to in this subclause (4)(I) has had,
or could reasonably be expected to have, a material
adverse effect on the Project, or (II) such failure
shall have continued, after Lime has been given a
notice specifying such failure and requiring it to be
remedied, for a period of 30 days and

(B) any applicable period for the cure of any failure
to perform or observe, or any applicable period for the cure of
any Event of Default referred to in the foregoing clause (A)
shall have expired.

(b) So long as any of the Existing Creditor Indebtedness shall
remain outstanding, the Existing Creditors shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to replace Lime as the operator of the Black River
Facility if the Existing Creditors or the Existing Creditors' Agent
(acting on behalf of the Existing Creditors) shall have conveyed,
assigned or sold the same to an Acceptable Transferee. If the Existing
Creditors have foreclosed on the Black River Facility and such
Acceptable Transferee intends to operate and maintain the Black River
Facility itself, the Existing Creditors may request that the Lender or
the Collateral Agent remove Lime as the Operator and appoint such
Acceptable Transferee in lieu thereof, and, if the Independent Engineer
has confirmed to the Lender in writing that such Acceptable Transferee
has the experience, personnel and expertise necessary to operate the
Project, the Lender or the Collateral Agent shall effect such
replacement.

(c) If at any time Lime has been replaced as Operator by the Lender
or the Collateral Agent, the Existing Creditors shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to replace Lime as the operator of the Black
River Facility.

(d) If Lime has been replaced as Operator, any Replacement Operator
(other than Lime if Lime shall have been reinstated as Operator) shall
be subject to removal at any time, with or without cause, upon 3
Business Days' prior written notice (i) from the Lender or the
Collateral Agent or (ii) by the Existing Creditors pursuant to Section
1.10(b).

(e) In the event of the removal of any Operator, such removed
Operator shall 

(i) cooperate and use its reasonable efforts to transfer (to
the extent transferable) any Governmental Approvals that it may
have which are required or useful in the operation of the Project
to any Replacement Operator or the SPV, and 
<PAGE> -10-<PAGE>
(ii) immediately thereafter deliver to any Replacement
Operator or to the SPV all books and records, equipment,
operating manuals, plans and specifications, tools, spare parts
and other materials used by such removed Operator in connection
with the Operating Work;

provided, however, that such removed Operator shall not be obliged to
transfer any such Governmental Approvals or equipment, operating
manuals, plans and specifications, tools, spare parts or other
materials if (A) such items are required or used by Lime in connection
with the operation of the Black River Facility, and (B) the cost of
obtaining same was not paid with funds provided by the SPV.

With regard to Governmental Approvals for which the cost was not paid by
SPV, but which are required or useful in the operation of the Project by
any Replacement Operator or the SPV, such removed Operator:

(A) shall not interfere with or lodge objection to
any efforts by Replacement Operator to obtain its own
Governmental Approvals for activities conducted on the
Site,

(B) upon request, shall consent to and cooperate in
the deletion, division and/or transfer to Replacement
Operator of those portions of the Governmental
Approvals governing those portions of the Site and
activities that cannot or will not, by virtue of
removal of Operator, be used by it in connection with
the operation of the Black River Facility, and

(C) with regard to Governmental Approvals for which
Replacement Operator cannot obtain new or transferred
Governmental Approvals without delay or unreasonable interference
with the continued operation of the Project, shall consent to and
not interfere with Replacement Operator's use of the then-
existing Governmental Approvals for the activities conducted on
the Site.

(f) Any Person that shall become the Operator or a Replacement
Operator hereunder shall have all of the rights, duties and obligations
of the Operator as specified herein.

1.11 Appointment of a New Operator. 

(a) In connection with any removal of the Operator pursuant to
Section 1.10(a), the Lender shall, subject to (1) approval by the
Independent Engineer, (2) the provisions of Section 1.10(a) and (b) and
(3) the following provisions of this Section 1.11(a), appoint a new
Operator (the "Replacement Operator") to assume the duties and
obligations of the Operator under this Agreement. Upon such
appointment, all references to the Operator herein shall be deemed to
be references to the Replacement Operator. During the 45-day period
referred to in Section 1.10(a)(i), the Lender and the Existing
Creditors shall attempt to reach mutual agreement as to a Replacement
Operator to be appointed hereunder. If the Lender and the Existing
Creditors agree to an appropriate Replacement Operator 
<PAGE> -11-<PAGE>
during such 45-day period, then the Lender shall appoint such Person as
Replacement Operator. If the Lender and the Existing Creditors are
unable to agree as to an appropriate Replacement Operator during such
45-day period, then the Lender may, subject to Section 1.10(b), appoint
a Replacement Operator without the Existing Creditors' consent;

(b) Any Replacement Operator shall have an obligation to negotiate
in good faith with the Existing Creditors to enter into an operation
and maintenance agreement with respect to the Black River Facility, but
neither such negotiation nor the execution of any such agreement shall
be a condition to any Replacement Operator acting hereunder.

1.12 Indemnification.

(a) The Operator shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnitee and each Existing Creditor from and against any and all
Expenses incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee or Existing
Creditor as a result of, arising out of, related to or in connection
with the Operator's, or any of its subcontractors', performance of the
Operator's obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, claims

(i) for injury to or death of persons and loss of or damage to
property (including, without limitation, the Project);

(ii) on account of any violation of any Applicable Law to be
complied with by the Operator or any contractor or subcontractor
hereunder; or

(iii) in respect of any taxes imposed on or attributable to the
income, property or activities of the Operator or demands by or
liens of suppliers or subcontractors for nonpayment of amounts
due as a result of furnishing work or materials to the Operator
in connection with the Project;

provided, however, that the Operator shall not defend, indemnify or
hold harmless any Indemnitee or Existing Creditor from and against, and
no Indemnitee or Existing Creditor shall be exculpated from, any
Expense to the extent (A) caused by or arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or Existing
Creditor or (B)(1) consisting of any Expense provided for in any
Project Budget or Extended Budget, or otherwise expressly provided for
in this Agreement, including Schedule 2 hereto, or (2) consisting of
any principal of, or interest or Make-Whole Amount in respect of, the
Notes.

(b) The procedures for such indemnification shall be governed by
Section 17.2 of the Note Purchase Agreement, which Section is
incorporated herein, mutatis mutandis, as if fully set forth herein.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Operator's obligations under this Section 1.12 are intended to, and
shall, survive termination of this Agreement.
<PAGE> -12-<PAGE>
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.12,
the Operator shall not be liable to indemnify any Indemnitee or
Existing Creditor for any Expenses representing any indirect, special
or consequential damages.

ARTICLE 2. OWNER'S SUPPLY OBLIGATIONS

2.1 Limestone Supply. Subject to the requirements of this Article 2,
the Owner hereby agrees to supply and sell to the Operator, for the
account of the SPV, such quantities of unprocessed limestone as shall be
necessary or advisable for the SPV to meet the requirements of the SPV for
the continuous operation of the Project at a Total Net Capability of at
least 650,000 tons per annum. Such unprocessed limestone supplied by the
Owner hereunder shall be suitable to meet the technical and other
specifications for processed lime set forth in the OPCO Agreement and all
such other processed lime supply contracts the SPV may, from time to time,
enter into in compliance with the Transaction Documents. The Owner shall
cause such unprocessed limestone to be tested in accordance with
reasonable and customary tests established by the Independent Engineer, in
accordance with Prudent Industry Practice, and shall maintain records of
the results of all such tests. Title to the unprocessed limestone sold to
the SPV pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall pass to the SPV at such time as
the unprocessed limestone is placed in the Project Kilns. Risk of loss
shall follow title.

2.2 Additional Supply Obligations of the Owner.

(a) The Owner further agrees to supply and sell to the Operator, for
the account of the SPV, all supplies, goods, materials and other
products, items and services set forth in Schedule 3 and such other
goods and services as may be required by the Operator in connection
with the Operating Work (collectively, together with the unprocessed
limestone, the "Supplies"). The cost of Supplies provided by the Owner
shall be determined in accordance with Schedule 2 hereto. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Owner, in performing
its duties hereunder, is acting as an independent contractor.

(b) The Owner may enter into such agreements or subcontracts (and
modifications thereof) and take such other action as the Owner, in
compliance with Prudent Industry Practice, deems necessary or
appropriate, in its judgment, or as may be required by Applicable Law,
to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. Any such agreement or
subcontract (or modification thereof), except for any collective
bargaining agreement, that provides for the payment of more than
$100,000 by any party thereto, or shall refer to the SPV, the Lender or
the Collateral Agent, shall expressly provide that it does not impose
on the SPV or any other party to the Transaction Documents (other than
the Owner) any obligation, liability or duty to a contractor or
subcontractor or create any contractual relationship between a
contractor or subcontractor and the SPV or any other party to the
Transaction Documents (other than the Owner).

(c) If the Owner shall at any time breach its obligation to supply
unprocessed limestone or any other Supplies required by this Article 2
(whether by anticipatory breach or otherwise), the SPV may take
commercially reasonable steps to obtain as promptly as possible a
suitable replacement for such limestone or other supplies; and the
Owner shall be liable to the SPV for the excess of the price so paid by
the SPV for such limestone 
<PAGE> -13-<PAGE>
or other Supplies (including the cost of labor attributable to mining
and the cost of such Supplies) over the price which SPV would have been
liable to pay therefor hereunder had the Owner not breached its supply
obligation, plus any expenses incidental to obtaining such suitable
replacement or other supplies.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Owner
shall obtain and maintain at all times for the benefit of the SPV or
its designee and the Project all material Governmental Approvals
relating to (i) the ownership, construction, operation and maintenance
of the Project in accordance with Applicable Law, and (ii) which can
not be, or are not, issued in the name of the SPV. The Owner shall
from time to time take any action as shall be necessary or desirable to
have issued in the name of the SPV any such material Governmental
Approval that must, by its nature, be issued in the name of the SPV in
accordance with Applicable Law.

(e) If OPCO becomes entitled to receive deliveries of processed lime
under the OPCO Agreement prior to the Substantial Completion Date,
promptly upon notice thereof from the SPV or the Operator, Lime shall
cause such deliveries to be made to OPCO on behalf of the SPV, from
lime processed at the Black River Processing Complex or the Maysville
Processing Complex, in strict compliance with the OPCO Agreement. In
no event shall Lime be entitled to receive any amounts payable by OPCO
to the SPV under the OPCO Agreement in respect of such lime deliveries
except as provided in Section 3.4 hereof.

2.3 Books of Record; Reports. The Owner shall keep all necessary
books of record, books of account and memoranda of all transactions
referred to in this Article 2 and in Article 3, including, without
limitation, records as to the Supplies provided and the funds received and
expended by the Owner in the performance of its obligations hereunder. 
Such books of record, books of account and memoranda shall be kept by the
Owner in such manner as to conform to GAAP and all Applicable Laws. The
Owner shall keep separate books of record, books of account and memoranda
of transactions for each of the Project and the Black River Facility.

2.4 Access to Books and Records. Upon reasonable notice to the Owner,
during normal business hours, the SPV, the Existing Creditors, the Lender
and their respective representatives shall, subject to customary
confidentiality and safety procedures, have (i) access to the Project and
the Black River Facility for purposes of the inspection thereof and (ii)
the right to inspect the books of record, books of account and memoranda
of the Owner relating to the Project or the Black River Facility, to make
copies and extracts therefrom (other than copies of and extracts from
proprietary data and information) and to discuss same with the executive
officers of the Owner. The Owner will cooperate with such Persons in
connection with any such inspection or discussion. Such inspection and
copying shall be solely at the risk and expense of the Person requesting
the same.

2.5 Payment of Supply Costs. The cost of Supplies under Sections 2.1
and 2.2 hereof shall be determined in accordance with Schedule 2 and shall
constitute Operation and Maintenance Costs. All payments of supply costs
shall be made by the Operator pursuant to Article 1 hereof. In the event
that the Operator fails to make all or a portion of the payments to the
Owner required to be made by the Operator hereunder, or the amount of such
disbursement is insufficient to pay all supply costs then due and payable,
then the Owner shall advance the 
<PAGE> -14-<PAGE>
amount of such disbursement or portion thereof and shall continue to
perform its obligations under this Article 2. If the Operator has not
fully repaid the amounts owing to the Owner under this Section 2.5 with
respect to an advance under this Section 2.5 by the close of business on
the first Business Day after the 60th day following the date on which the
advance was made, the Owner shall not have any further obligation to
advance additional funds pursuant to this Section 2.5 or to continue to
perform its obligations under this Article 2, and the Operator shall
remain obligated to repay such advances. Except as provided in this
Section 2.5, the Owner shall not be required to advance its own funds to
the Operator in order to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

2.6 Annual Audit. The books, records and accounts of supply costs
maintained by the Owner pursuant to Section 2.3 shall be subject to an
audit as of the end of and for each Contract Year by KPMG Peat Marwick or
another firm of nationally recognized independent public accountants
selected by the Operator. The SPV, the Lender and the Existing Creditors,
and any of their respective representatives, shall be permitted to check
and review all accounting records relating to the Project or the Black
River Facility and to observe the procedures followed by the Owner's
accountants. The report of such firm of independent public accountants
shall be submitted to the Owner, with a copy to the Operator, the SPV,
each Existing Creditor and the Lender within 90 days after the end of such
Contract Year. The cost of such annual audits shall constitute Operation
and Maintenance Costs.

2.7 Uncontrollable Forces. The Owner shall not be considered to be in
default in the performance of any of its obligations under this Article 2,
other than obligations to pay money, if (a) such failure of performance
shall be due to Uncontrollable Forces and (b) the obligations of the
"Producer" are similarly excused under the OPCO Agreement as well as under
each and every Economically Similar Contract. If the Owner is rendered
unable to perform any obligation by reason of Uncontrollable Forces, it
shall, upon acquiring knowledge of the same, give prompt notice of such
fact to the other parties hereto and shall exercise reasonable diligence
to remove said inability with all reasonable dispatch. Lime covenants
that, to the extent that SPV is unable to produce processed lime at the
Project required to service the OPCO Agreement as the result of an
Operating Emergency or Uncontrollable Forces (or any combination of the
foregoing), Lime shall comply with the OPCO Agreement (including, without
limitation, Articles 1(a) and (b) thereof).

2.8 Most Favored Nation. Neither Lime, nor any party that would be a
successor to or assign of Lime for purposes of the OPCO Agreement, or that
would otherwise be bound by the OPCO Agreement, shall, without the consent
of the Holders, take any action which would require an adjustment to the
purchase price to OPCO under the OPCO Agreement in accordance with Article
XXII of the OPCO Agreement

ARTICLE 3. COMMON FACILITIES AND TOLLING

3.1 Tolling and Use of Common Facilities.

(a) The SPV hereby covenants that, if the Owner has made all
payments due from it hereunder (including, without limitation, payments
due under Section 3.2) and the Owner is otherwise in full compliance
with its obligations under Article 2 and Section 5.6(c) hereof and
under the Easement Agreement, then the Owner shall, on and after the 
<PAGE> -15-<PAGE>
Operation Commencement Date, have the right, subject to Section 3.1(b), to
deliver unprocessed limestone to the Project for processing by the
Operator. Subject to the provisions hereof (including, without
limitation, Sections 1.5 and 3.1(b)), the Operator shall process through
the Project any and all unprocessed limestone delivered by the Owner
pursuant to the preceding sentence.

(b) The parties hereto agree that processed lime produced by the
Project shall be utilized to satisfy lime supply contracts in the
following order of priority: first, the OPCO Agreement or any
Economically Similar Contracts; second, if and to the extent that the
Owner has made all payments due hereunder (including under Section 3.2)
and the Owner is otherwise in full compliance with its obligations
under Article 2 hereof and Section 5.6(c) and under the Easement
Agreement, the existing lime supply contracts of Lime set forth on
Schedule 4, as such contracts may from time to time be amended,
supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified in accordance with their
respective terms, and any other lime supply contracts of Lime entered
into after the date hereof; and third, other lime supply contracts, if
any, entered into by the SPV with the consent of the Existing
Creditors.

(c) (i) The Owner covenants that the Operator and the SPV shall, on
and after the Operation Commencement Date, and for so long as the SPV
shall be in compliance with this Section 3.1, have the right to use the
Black River Common Facilities in connection with the exercise of the
rights and the discharge of the duties of the Operator and the SPV
under this Agreement and as contemplated by the Easement Agreement.

(ii) The Operator and the SPV covenant that the Owner shall, on
and after the Operation Commencement Date, and for so long as the Owner
shall be in compliance with its obligations under Article 2, have the
right to use the Project-Owned Common Facilities in connection with the
exercise of the rights and the discharge of the duties of the Owner under
this Agreement and as contemplated by the Easement Agreement.

(iii) The Operator shall operate the Project and the Black River
Processing Complex for the benefit of the Owner and the SPV in
accordance with this Agreement and the Easement Agreement. Each of the
Operator and the Owner covenants that, during the term of this
Agreement, it shall operate, maintain, rebuild and repair the Project
in compliance with the requirements imposed upon the SPV by Section 9
of the Note Purchase Agreement to the extent applicable to such
operation, maintenance, rebuilding or repair (other than Sections 9.4,
9.12 to 9.16, inclusive, 9.18 and 9.19), which Section to the extent so
applicable (other than such specified sections) is incorporated herein
by reference, mutatis mutandis.

3.2 Tolling Payments and Capacity Payments.

(a) No later than 30 days after the end of each calendar month
following the Substantial Completion Date, the Owner shall
<PAGE> -16-<PAGE>
(i) make a payment (each, a "Tolling Payment") to the
Disbursement Agent, in an amount equal to 50% of the result of
(A) the Scheduled Variable Cost Savings Per Ton multiplied by (y)
the number of Non-OPCO Tons produced by the Project during such
month; and

(ii) make a payment to the Disbursement Agent in an amount
equal to the result of (A) the Operation and Maintenance Costs of
the Project during such month (other than Operation and
Maintenance Costs paid with the written consent of the SPV that
relate to Capital Additions or Modifications, adjustments,
alterations, and other physical changes to the Project and
material substitutions, replacements or repairs of parts or
equipment incorporated into the Project) multiplied by (B) a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of Non-OPCO Tons
produced by the Project during such month and the denominator of
which is the total number of tons of processed lime produced by
the Project during such month.

(b) (i) Subject to Section 3.2(b)(ii) below, no later than 30
days after the end of each Project Quarter, Lime shall make a
capacity payment (each, a "Capacity Payment") to the Disbursement
Agent in an amount equal to one half of

(A) the product obtained by multiplying (1) 1.3 by
(2) the amount of Capacity Payment Debt Service payable
with respect to such Project Quarter and the next
succeeding Project Quarter, minus

(B) the Deemed Cash Flow attributable to the sum of
(1) the actual number of tons of processed lime
purchased by OPCO pursuant to the OPCO Agreement or
purchased pursuant to Economically Similar Contracts
during such Project Quarter plus (2) the number of tons
of processed lime projected to be purchased by OPCO
during such next succeeding Project Quarter, as set
forth in the letter delivered by OPCO pursuant to
Article III(c) of the OPCO Agreement (provided, that in
no event shall such sum be less than 150,000), minus

(C) the sum of the Tolling Payments made by the Owner
in respect of such Project Quarter and the immediately
preceding Project Quarter;

provided, however, that the Capacity Payment shall not be less
than zero.

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 3.2(b)(i), the aggregate amount
of Capacity Payments payable by Lime with respect to any Contract
Year shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the sum of the payments
due with respect to Project Quarters during such Contract Year
pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(i); and (B) the Maximum Capacity
Payment with respect to such Contract Year.

(iii) The Maximum Capacity Payment with respect to any
Contract Year shall be an amount equal to (A) the product
obtained by multiplying (1) 1.3 and (2) the amount of Capacity
Payment Debt Service payable with respect to such Contract Year,
minus (B) the Deemed Cash Flow attributable to 300,000 tons of 
<PAGE> -17-<PAGE>
processed lime; provided, however, that, so long as Lime is the
Owner and owns and operates the Maysville Processing Complex, in
the event that an aggregate of less than 190,000 tons of Non-OPCO
Lime under Compatible Lime Supply Agreements are produced at the
Project, the Black River Processing Complex and the Maysville
Processing Complex during a Contract Year, the Maximum Capacity
Payment for such Contract Year shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the product of (x) the Scheduled Variable Cost Savings
Per Ton and (y) the excess of (I) 190,000 over (II) the aggregate
number of tons (but not less than 60,000 in any event) of
Non-OPCO Lime under Compatible Lime Supply Agreements produced at
the Project, the Black River Processing Complex and the Maysville
Processing Complex during such Contract Year; and provided
further, that, so long as Lime is the Owner and owns and operates
the Maysville Processing Complex, in the event that an aggregate
of less than 60,000 tons of Non-OPCO Lime under Compatible Lime
Supply Agreements are produced at the Project, the Black River
Processing Complex and the Maysville Processing Complex during a
Contract Year, the Maximum Capacity Payment for such Contract
Year shall be further reduced by an amount equal to the product
of (xx) the Project Profit Margin Per Ton and (yy) the excess of
(I) 60,000 over (II) the aggregate number of tons of Non-OPCO
Lime under Compatible Lime Supply Agreements produced at the
Project, the Black River Processing Complex and the Maysville
Processing Complex during such Contract Year.

(iv) Deemed Cash Flow for various levels of lime production
shall be as set forth on Schedule 5 hereto.

(v) The Capacity Payment payable with respect to any Project
Quarter shall be adjusted to reflect the limitations set forth in
Section 3.2(b)(ii) and Section 3.2(b)(iii); provided, however,
that if the Capacity Payments paid at any time during a Contract
Year equal the Maximum Capacity Payment with respect to such
Contract Year, no further Capacity Payments shall be payable with
respect to such Contract Year.

(c) Each payment made by the Owner or Lime under this Article 3
shall be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate of the Owner or Lime,
as the case may be, setting forth in detail the calculations of such
payment. Upon the request of the Lender or the SPV, the Owner or Lime,
as the case may be, shall provide such additional information and
details as such Person may reasonably request concerning the
calculation of such payment.

(d) If OPCO has claimed a credit under Article 3(e) and Article 3(f)
of the OPCO Agreement with respect to any processed lime sold to a
purchaser other than OPCO, Lime shall pay to the SPV, promptly upon
receipt thereof, all revenues arising from such sale. If such
processed lime was processed at the Black River Processing Complex or
the Maysville Processing Complex, the SPV will make the payment
provided for in Section 3.4 (ii) for the cost of production thereof,
and such cost of production shall constitute Operation and Maintenance
Costs for purposes of the Deposit and Disbursement Agreement. 
<PAGE> -18-<PAGE>
3.3 Uncontrollable Forces. Neither the Owner nor the SPV shall be
considered to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations
under this Article 3, other than obligations to pay money, if such failure
of performance shall be due to Uncontrollable Forces; provided that if
such Uncontrollable Forces arise as a result of the unavailability of the
Owner's personnel, the SPV may hire such personnel, in accordance with
Applicable Law, as may be necessary to permit operation and maintenance of
the Project and the Black River Common Facilities. If either such party
is rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of Uncontrollable
Forces, it shall, upon acquiring knowledge of the same, give prompt notice
of such fact to the other parties hereto and shall exercise reasonable
diligence to remove said inability with all reasonable dispatch.

3.4 Maysville and Black River Production. If the SPV is paid the
gross revenues arising from the sale of any quantity of processed lime
that was processed at the Black River Processing Complex or the Maysville
Processing Complex, including, without limitation, (i) lime sold to OPCO
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or Section 2.7 hereof and (ii) processed lime
in respect of which OPCO has claimed a credit under Article 3(e) and
Article 3(f) of the OPCO Agreement, the SPV will, on the first and
fifteenth days of each month, pay to Lime for each ton of such processed
lime for which SPV has received such revenues, an amount equal to the
fixed and variable costs of producing such ton at the facility where such
production occurred.

3.5 Books and Records; Access. Lime shall keep all necessary books of
record, books of account and memoranda with respect to its Capacity
Payment obligation hereunder. Upon reasonable notice to Lime, during
normal business hours, the SPV, the Existing Creditors, the Lender and
their respective representatives shall, subject to customary
confidentiality and safety procedures, have the right to inspect such
books of record, books of account and memoranda, to make copies and
extracts therefrom (other than copies of and extracts from proprietary
data and information) and to discuss the same with Lime's executive
officers. Lime will cooperate with such Persons in connection with any
such inspection or discussion. Such inspection and copying shall be
solely at the risk and expense of the Person requesting the same.

agreement to which the SPV or the Owner may, from time to time, be a
party), in a good, workmanlike and commercially reasonable manner and in
accordance with Prudent Industry Practice. The Operator shall exercise
such care and shall act diligently as a prudent business entity engaged in
the business of managing and operating a limestone processing facility
comparable to the Project owned by it (or its Affiliates) would exercise
for the advancement and protection of its own economic interests.

II. Insurance; Compliance with Insurance Policies, Governmental
Requirements, etc. The Operator shall procure and maintain all insurance
required to be maintained by the SPV under the Transaction Documents, and
also shall be responsible for making and administering all claims on
behalf of the SPV under insurance policies covering the SPV or the Project
during the term of this Agreement. The Operator shall comply in all
material respects with, and cause the Project and all Operator personnel
to comply in all material respects with, all applicable standards required
by Prudent Industry Practice, all insurance policies in effect from time
to time with respect to the Project, all manufacturer's recommended
guidelines, all Applicable Laws, all applicable Governmental Approvals and
the Transaction Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Operator shall obtain and maintain at all times for the
benefit of the SPV or its designee and the Project all material
Governmental Approvals, and which can not be, or are not, issued in the
name of the SPV. The Operator shall from time to time take such action as

Governmental Approval that must, by its nature, be issued in the name of
the SPV in accordance with Applicable Law.

III. Personnel. The Operator shall at all times employ, or cause to
be employed, qualified personnel, properly trained to perform the
Operating Work, and shall pay all wages and benefits required by
Applicable Law or contract. The Operator shall be responsible for all

obligations under this Agreement. The Operator shall comply with all
applicable warranties and guarantees provided by manufacturers or
contractors, and shall take no action that in any way impairs any rights
or claims of the SPV under any manufacturer's, supplier's or other party's
warranty. Without limiting the foregoing, the Operator shall use spare
parts that will not adversely affect the SPV's protections or rights under
such warranties or guarantees.

V. Operation and Maintenance. The Operator shall operate and maintain

DEPOSIT AND DISBURSEMENT AGREEMENT

DEPOSIT AND DISBURSEMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of August 1, 1994,
between WILMINGTON TRUST COMPANY, as Disbursement Agent and as Collateral
Agent and DRAVO BLACK RIVER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (the "SPV").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, for purposes of this Agreement capitalized terms used but
not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings given
such terms in Annex A to the Note Purchase Agreement; the rules of usage
set forth in said Annex A shall apply to this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, in order to finance the acquisition, construction and
equipping of the Project and certain related expenditures, the SPV, among
other things, has entered into the Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to
which the Lender shall purchase the Notes; and

WHEREAS, the Lender and any other holder or holders of any of the
Notes from time to time shall be referred to herein individually as a
"Holder" and collectively as the "Holders"; and

WHEREAS, the Disbursement Agent is willing to act as Disbursement
Agent hereunder and to hold and disburse the funds deposited hereunder in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the SPV Security Agreement, the SPV has, among
other things, pledged its interest in the Accounts created hereunder to the
Collateral Agent as security for the Secured Obligations; and

WHEREAS, the Lender, the Collateral Agent and the SPV desire to
appoint the Disbursement Agent to administer the Accounts established
hereunder and to receive, deposit and disburse all Project Revenues, all on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to
induce the Lender to purchase the Notes pursuant to the Note Purchase
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1. APPOINTMENT OF DISBURSEMENT AGENT; ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ACCOUNTS

1.1 Acceptance of Appointment of Disbursement Agent.

(a) Acceptance of Appointment. The Disbursement Agent is
hereby appointed and agrees to act as the Disbursement Agent for all
Project Revenues and all other revenues, receipts, monies, proceeds
and other sums derived in any manner from or constituting the
Collateral. The Disbursement Agent shall hold and safeguard each
Account during the term of this Agreement and shall treat the cash,
instruments and securities in such Account as SPV Collateral.
<PAGE> -1-<PAGE>

(b) No SPV Rights. Neither the SPV nor any Affiliate thereof
shall have any rights against the Disbursement Agent (other than rights
which may arise as a result of the Disbursement Agent's gross negligence
or wilful misconduct), as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, including,
without limitation, any right to direct the Disbursement Agent to distribute
or allocate any funds in the Accounts. Any withdrawal, transfer or
investment made or caused to be made in accordance with the provisions
hereof is expressly understood to be made with the permission of the
parties hereto. In performing its functions and duties under this
Agreement, the Disbursement Agent shall act solely as agent for the
Collateral Agent and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have
assumed any obligation toward, or relationship of agency or trust with or
for, the SPV or any of its Affiliates.

1.2 Creation of the Accounts.

(a) Accounts. The Disbursement Agent hereby establishes
the following special, segregated and irrevocable cash collateral
accounts which shall be maintained at all times until the termination
of this Agreement:

(i) Construction Account,

(ii) Project Revenue Account,
(iii) Debt Service Reserve,

(iv) Additional Reserve,

(v) Default Reserve,
(vi) Casualty Account,
(vii) Construction Completion Account, and 
(viii)Windup Account.
The account number for each Account is set forth on Schedule I
hereto. All amounts from time to time in any Account shall be held in
the name of the Disbursement Agent for the benefit of the Collateral
Agent. All amounts at any time in any of the Accounts shall
constitute a part of the SPV Collateral and shall not constitute
payment of any obligation owing to the Holders until applied as
hereinafter provided.

(b) Bailment. The Collateral Agent hereby appoints the
Disbursement Agent as its bailee of the SPV Collateral held by the
Disbursement Agent hereunder, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

1.3 Security Interests; Revenues; Miscellaneous.

(a) Security Interests in Project Revenues. Each of the
parties (but in the case of the Disbursement Agent, solely in reliance
upon the acknowledgment of the other 
<PAGE> -2-<PAGE>
parties, without independent knowledge or investigation) hereby
acknowledges that (i) the SPV has assigned the SPV Collateral
(including the Accounts) to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the SPV
Security Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. It is
pursuant to the Collateral Agent's rights as holder of a security
interest in the SPV Collateral that the Collateral Agent has the right
to appoint a Disbursement Agent hereunder and otherwise has rights
under this Agreement.

(b) Direct Deposit of Project Revenues And Other Amounts. 
Subject to Section 2.8, the SPV agrees to arrange, and hereby
confirms that it has arranged, for the direct payment to the
Disbursement Agent (for the benefit of the Collateral Agent) of all
Project Revenues. The SPV hereby agrees that all Project Revenues
shall be deposited in the Project Revenue Account. To the extent any
Project Revenues or other amounts (except the amounts specified in
clauses (i) through (iii) of the definition of Project Revenues in
Annex A to the Note Purchase Agreement) are at any time received by
the SPV, the SPV will hold all Project Revenues and other such
amounts (including all Substitute OPCO Revenues (as defined in
Section 2.3(c) hereof)) in trust for the benefit of the Collateral
Agent and will pay Project Revenues and other such amounts to the
Disbursement Agent for deposit into the Project Revenue Account on
the Business Day following receipt thereof (duly endorsed, if
necessary, to the Disbursement Agent). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the SPV has instructed OPCO and any
other Person to which it sells lime or any other commodity, or to which
it provides any other services, to pay directly to the Disbursement
Agent for deposit in the Project Revenue Account all amounts payable
under the OPCO Agreement or otherwise and, with respect to other
such Persons, the related agreement.

(c) UCC Filings. The Disbursement Agent shall take such
action as may be requested by the SPV or the Collateral Agent in
order to comply with the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (as
in effect in any applicable jurisdiction) governing the establishment,
preservation, protection or perfection of security interests in the
Accounts.

2. DEPOSITS INTO AND DISBURSEMENTS FROM ACCOUNTS

The SPV hereby authorizes the Disbursement Agent to make the
following deposits and withdrawals with respect to the Accounts. All
obligations with regard to deposits and disbursements set forth in
any provision of this Section are subject to the wind-up provisions
set forth in Section 2.8 and the cure rights set forth in Section 2.9.

2.1 Construction Account.

(a) Deposits. The Disbursement Agent shall deposit into the
Construction Account (i) all amounts advanced by the Lender pursuant
to the Note Purchase Agreement and transferred by the Lender to the

all amounts contributed by Lime, through the Partners, pursuant to
Section 3.15 of the Lime Security Agreement and transferred by Lime
to the Disbursement Agent for deposit into the Construction Account.
<PAGE> -3-<PAGE>
(b) Disbursements. The Disbursement Agent shall disburse
funds in the Construction Account, within one Business Day of its
receipt of such funds, to the Persons and in the amounts set forth in
the Approved Draw Request pursuant to which such funds were
advanced by the Lender. In addition, on the Conversion Date, after
giving effect to the Advance, if any, to be made on such date
pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, and upon (i) the purchase
of the Term Notes by the Lender on such date and (ii) the
disbursement of funds, if any, into the Construction Completion
Account and the Debt Service Reserve in compliance with Section 8.19
of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Disbursement Agent shall
disburse to the SPV all moneys on deposit in the Construction Account
up to, but not in excess of, Five Million Three Hundred Thousand

(i) all payments received from the Operator and the
Owner under the MCFA; and

(ii) all payments received from OPCO or any other
Person for goods or services supplied by the Project.

Payment Date (except with respect to subclause (A) below in

aggregate amount, if any, of all prior Debt Service that
remains unpaid on such Debt Payment Date (together with
interest on such unpaid amount at the Late Payment Rate);

<PAGE> -6-<PAGE>
(i) Prior to the Conversion Date, the Disbursement
Agent shall disburse from the Debt Service Reserve on the
first and fifteenth days of each month, to Lime so long as Lime
is not in default of its obligations under the MCFA (or if any
such default exists, the grace period, if any, in respect
thereof has not expired (it being understood that "grace period"
does not include any cure period referred to in Section 6 of the
Intercreditor Agreement)), the amount due and owing to Lime
under Section 3.4 of the MCFA, as specified in a certificate (in
the form of Exhibit F hereto) executed by Lime and delivered by
the SPV to the Disbursement Agent and the Lender at least 5
days before such date.

(ii) The Disbursement Agent shall disburse funds from
the Debt Service Reserve to the Lender on each Debt Payment
Date if the amount available for disbursement on such date
from the Project Revenue Account for the payment of Debt
Service due on or prior to such date shall be less than the
amount of such Debt Service (the amount of such shortfall being
referred to herein as the "Debt Service Shortfall"). The amount
of such disbursement shall be equal to the lesser of (x) the
Debt Service Shortfall minus any amount applied to the Debt
Service Shortfall from the Additional Reserve and (y) the
amount on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve.

(iii) Upon receipt of a certificate (in the form of Exhibit
G hereto) executed by the SPV and the Collateral Agent in
respect of an overfunding of the Debt Service Reserve, the
Disbursement Agent shall disburse funds from the Debt Service
Reserve to the Project Revenue Account on each Debt Payment
Date to the extent that the aggregate amount on deposit in the
Debt Service Reserve shall exceed One Year's Debt Service
(whether by reason of interest and other sums earned in
respect of the Debt Service Reserve or otherwise), as specified
in such certificate. The Collateral Agent shall be obligated to
deliver such a certificate to the Disbursement Agent after it
has received evidence satisfactory to it from the SPV that any
such excess shall exist.

(c) Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

(i) "Excess Cash Flow" means, as of any date of
determination and for any period, the amount by which

(A) the aggregate amount of all Project Revenues in
respect of such period paid on or prior to the date of
determination, exceeds

(B) the aggregate amount of disbursements required
to be made by the Disbursement Agent during such period
(whether or not actually made) pursuant to subclauses (1)
through (4), inclusive, of Section 2.2(b)(ii)(A) and pursuant
to Section 2.2(b)(ii)(B).

(ii) "One Year's Debt Service" means, the largest
aggregate amount of principal and interest scheduled to be paid

<PAGE> -7-<PAGE>
period of twelve consecutive months ending on or prior to the
maturity of the Term Notes, in each case as determined by
reference to Schedule II hereto.

(iii) "Substitute OPCO Revenues" means all amounts
payable by OPCO under the OPCO Agreement in respect of lime
which was not processed by the Project.

2.4 Additional Reserve.

(a) Deposits. If, either

(i) on any Debt Payment Date, the Debt Service
Coverage Ratio for the Interim Period most recently ended as of
such date was equal to or less than 1.30 to 1, or

(ii) on any Debt Payment Date, the Projected Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for each of the two consecutive Interim
Periods immediately following such most recently ended Interim
Period is equal to or less than 1.30 to 1, 

then, on such Debt Payment Date and on each Debt Payment Date
thereafter, upon receipt of a certificate (in the form of Exhibit H
hereto) (an "Additional Reserve Certificate") executed by the
Collateral Agent in respect of such conditions, the Disbursement
Agent shall disburse 100% of Excess Cash Flow, net of any deposits
required to be made into the Debt Service Reserve pursuant to
Section 2.3(a), from the Project Revenue Account and deposit such sum
into the Additional Reserve until the Debt Payment Date on which both
(x) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for each of the two then most
recently ended Interim Periods, and (y) the Projected Debt Service
Coverage Ratio for each of the two consecutive Interim Periods
immediately following the then most recently ended Interim Period,
shall be equal to or greater than 1.40 to 1. Effective as of the Debt
Payment Date on which both of the conditions set forth in the
foregoing subclauses (x) and (y) shall be satisfied, but only upon its
receipt of an Additional Reserve Certificate executed by the
Collateral Agent in respect of such conditions, the Disbursement
Agent shall make no further such disbursements from the Project
Revenue Account pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) but all Excess Cash
Flow theretofore deposited into the Additional Reserve pursuant to
this Section 2.4(a) shall remain on deposit therein (subject to
disbursement as provided herein); provided, however, that, at such
time as either of the conditions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) shall again be satisfied, and upon its receipt of an
appropriate Additional Reserve Certificate, the Disbursement Agent
shall again make the deposits provided for in the first sentence of
this Section 2.4(a). The Collateral Agent shall be obligated to deliver
an appropriate Additional Reserve Certificate to the Disbursement
Agent if, after either of the conditions set forth in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) have occurred, it shall have received evidence
satisfactory to it from the SPV that both of the conditions set forth
in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) have been satisfied.

(b) Disbursements.

(i) The Disbursement Agent shall disburse funds from
the Additional Reserve to the Lender on any Debt Payment Date
if there shall be a Debt Service 
<PAGE> -8-<PAGE>
Shortfall on such date. The amount of such disbursement shall
be equal to the lesser of (A) the Debt Service Shortfall for
such date and (B) the amount on deposit in the Additional
Reserve.

(ii) If, on any Debt Payment Date,

(A) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for each of
the two then most recently ended Interim Periods was
equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1 and

(B) the Projected Debt Service Coverage Ratio for
each of the two consecutive Interim Periods immediately
following the then most recently ended Interim Period is
equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1,

the Disbursement Agent shall, upon receipt of a certificate (in
the form of Exhibit I hereto) (an "Additional Reserve
Disbursement Certificate") executed by the SPV and the
Collateral Agent in respect of such conditions, disburse all
amounts on deposit in the Additional Reserve and deposit such
funds into the Project Revenue Account for disbursement as
provided in Section 2.2. The Collateral Agent shall be obligated
to deliver an Additional Reserve Disbursement Certificate to
the Disbursement Agent after it shall have received evidence
satisfactory to it from the SPV that the conditions set forth in
the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) have been satisfied.

(iii) As used in this Section 2.4, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:

(A) "Projected Debt Service Coverage Ratio"
means, for any period, the ratio of

(1) the amount of all Project Revenues
projected to be paid during such period minus the
aggregate amount of disbursements projected to be
made by the Disbursement Agent during such period
pursuant to subclause (A) of Section 2.2(b)(ii), to

(2) the aggregate amount of disbursements
projected to be made by the Disbursement Agent
during such period in respect of payments pursuant
to subclause (B) of Section 2.2(b)(ii),

in each case as set forth in the Project Budget (or the
Extended Project Budget if applicable) delivered to the
Disbursement Agent and the Collateral Agent in respect of
such period.

(B) "Debt Service Coverage Ratio" means, as of
any date of determination and for any period, the ratio of

(1) the amount of all Project Revenues in
respect of such period paid on or prior to the date
of determination, minus the
<PAGE> -9-<PAGE>
disbursements required to be made by the
Disbursement Agent during such period (whether or
not actually made) pursuant to subclause (A) of
Section 2.2(b)(ii), to

(2) the aggregate amount of disbursements
required to be made by the Disbursement Agent
during such period in respect of payments (whether
or not actually made) pursuant to subclause (B) of
Section 2.2(b)(ii).

2.5 Default Reserve.

(a) Deposits. On any Debt Payment Date when an Event of
Default exists, unless otherwise instructed by the Collateral Agent,
and so long as no deposits are required to be made into the Additional
Reserve on such date pursuant to Section 2.4(a) (it being understood
that no deposit shall be made into the Default Reserve at any time if
a deposit is required to be made into the Additional Reserve at such
time), the Disbursement Agent shall disburse 100% of Excess Cash
Flow, net of any deposits required to be made into the Debt Service
Reserve pursuant to Section 2.3(a), from the Project Revenue Account
and deposit such amount into the Default Reserve; provided, however,
that if,

(i) (A) on the immediately preceding Debt Payment Date
one or more Dravo-Related Defaults existed and no other Event
of Default existed, and (B) the Disbursement Agent made the
disbursement and deposit in respect thereof, as contemplated
by this Section 2.5(a), and

(ii) on such then current Debt Payment Date, the only
Event of Default in existence is the Dravo-Related Default or
Dravo-Related Defaults that were in existence on such
immediately preceding Debt Payment Date,

then no such disbursement and deposit shall be made on such then
current Debt Payment Date. All amounts deposited into the Default
Reserve at any time when an Event of Default, other than a Dravo-
Related Default, exists shall remain on deposit in the Default
Reserve, regardless of whether such Event of Default shall
thereafter be cured or otherwise cease to exist, and regardless of
whether a Dravo-Related Default existed at the same time as such
Event of Default.

(b) Disbursements. All amounts deposited into the Default
Reserve at any time when the only Event of Default which exists is a
Dravo-Related Default shall remain on deposit in the Default Reserve
until the first Debt Payment Date on which no Event of Default shall
exist, at which time such amounts shall be disbursed from the Default
Reserve and deposited into the Project Revenue Account for
disbursement as provided in Section 2.3(b).

(c) Knowledge of Defaults. The Disbursement Agent shall not
be deemed to have knowledge of an Event of Default unless and until
it shall have received notice thereof from the SPV, the Lender or the
Collateral Agent, and shall assume that no Event of Default exists
except Events of Default in respect of which it shall have received
such 
<PAGE> -10-<PAGE>
notice. The Disbursement Agent shall assume that each Event of
Default of which it has received notice is continuing until such time
as it shall receive notice from the Lender or the Collateral Agent
that such Event of Default has been cured. The Collateral Agent
shall be obligated to deliver such notice to the Disbursement Agent
promptly after it receives notice from the Holders that any Event of
Default has been cured.

2.6 Casualty Account.

(a) Deposits. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees
that if it shall receive any proceeds (other than proceeds of any
business interruption policy) in respect of a Loss Event
(collectively, "Casualty Proceeds") which is a Partial Loss, such party
shall promptly remit such Casualty Proceeds (less the actual costs,
fees, and expenses incurred in the collection thereof as certified in
a certificate executed by the SPV or Lime) to the Disbursement Agent
for deposit into the Casualty Account, together with a certificate
stating the source of the Casualty Proceeds, a detailed description
of the Partial Loss giving rise to such party's receipt thereof, and
instructions to deposit such Casualty Proceeds into the Casualty
Account. Until such time that such party shall remit such Casualty
Proceeds to the Disbursement Agent, it shall hold such proceeds in
trust for the benefit of the Disbursement Agent for application as
provided herein.

(b) Disbursements.

(i) If (A) the aggregate Casualty Proceeds received by
the Disbursement Agent in respect of any single Partial Loss
shall not exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), (B)
the SPV shall, at least ten days prior to any disbursement
pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), deliver to the Disbursement
Agent and the Lender a certificate (in the form of Exhibit J)
setting forth, inter alia, a detailed description of the repairs
to be effected with such Casualty Proceeds, a certification
that the sum of (x) the amount of such Casualty Proceeds, plus
(y) the applicable deductibles and self-insured amounts under
the SPV's insurance policies, is not less than the amount of
such repairs and an undertaking to complete such repairs, and
(C) no Event of Default shall exist at the time of proposed
disbursement, the Disbursement Agent shall disburse such
Casualty Proceeds to (or at the direction of) the SPV in the
amounts specified in such certificate.

(ii) If the aggregate Casualty Proceeds received by the
Disbursement Agent in respect of any single Partial Loss shall
exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and no Event
of Default shall exist, the Disbursement Agent shall disburse
such proceeds to the SPV from time to time, in each case upon
presentation to the Disbursement Agent of a request therefor,
approved by the Independent Engineer: (A) specifying the
amount so to be disbursed, (B) annexing invoices (not previously
used as a basis for any disbursement of funds pursuant to this
Section 2.6(b)(ii)) demonstrating expenditures made or to be made
by the SPV upon receipt of such funds for repair and/or
replacement of the Project and (C) certifying that (i) such
repair and/or replacement is technically feasible for a cost
not in excess of the sum of (x) the amount of available Casualty
Proceeds plus (y) the applicable deductibles and self-insured
amounts under the 
<PAGE> -11-<PAGE>
SPV's insurance policies, and (2) such repair and/or restoration
is proceeding in compliance with the SPV's obligations under
Section 11.2 of the Note Purchase Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents.

(c) Knowledge of Defaults. The Disbursement Agent shall
determine the existence or non-existence of an Event of Default in
the manner provided in Section 2.5(c).

2.7 Construction Completion Account.

(a) Deposits. On the Conversion Date, the SPV, pursuant to
Section 8.19 of the Note Purchase Agreement, shall deposit into the
Construction Completion Account an amount equal to 100% of the
aggregate cost of completing the Punch List Items.

(b) Disbursements. From time to time, upon the request of
the SPV (or Lime as Construction Manager) made pursuant to a
certificate (in the form of Exhibit K hereto) approved by the
Independent Engineer and the Lender and delivered to the
Disbursement Agent at least five days prior to the proposed
disbursement date, the Disbursement Agent shall disburse from the
Construction Completion Account the amount set forth in such
certificate to pay the cost of completed Punch List Items. Such
disbursement shall be made directly to Lime for payment to such
Persons as the SPV shall specify in such certificate. Following
receipt by the Disbursement Agent of a notice from the SPV that all
Punch List Items have been completed and the cost thereof has been
paid, the Disbursement Agent shall disburse any remaining balance in
the Construction Completion Account and deposit such balance into
the Project Revenue Account.

2.8 Windup Account.

(a) Deposits. The Disbursement Agent shall deposit into the
Windup Account any of the following amounts received from any
Person:

(i) Casualty Proceeds (less the actual costs, fees and
expenses incurred in the collection thereof as certified in a
certificate executed by the SPV or Lime) received as a result of
the occurrence of a Total Loss; and

(ii) all amounts received as a result of the exercise of
any remedy under any Transaction Document.

(b) Disbursements.

(i) Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding (subject, however, to the proviso set forth

hereto) executed by the Collateral Agent stating that a Windup
Event has occurred and is continuing and specifying the nature
of same, the Disbursement Agent shall not make any further
transfers pursuant to any Section of this Agreement other

(x) all amounts then on deposit in all other Accounts and (y) all
<PAGE> -12-<PAGE>
Project Revenues and other amounts then held or subsequently
received by the Disbursement Agent which would otherwise have
been deposited in any Account. On the date or dates specified
in such certificate or in a subsequent certificate executed by
the Collateral Agent, the Disbursement Agent shall make
disbursements from the Windup Account in the following order of
priority (so that, if there shall be insufficient funds to make
all such payments, no payment set forth below shall be made
until all amounts owing in respect of all payments with a higher
priority shall have been paid in full):

(A) First, to the payment of the costs and
expenses of foreclosure or suit, if any, and of the sale
of the Collateral, and all proper expenses, liability and
advances, including reasonable legal expenses and
attorneys' fees, incurred or made by the Collateral Agent
and the Disbursement Agent, and all taxes, assessments or
Liens superior to the Lien of the Collateral Agent on the
Collateral, except any taxes, assessments or other
superior Lien subject to which said sale may have been
made;

(B) Second, to the payment of all reasonable
expenses, liabilities and advances, including reasonable
legal expenses and attorneys' fees, incurred or made by
the Holders;

the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by each;

(D) Fourth, to the payment of the unpaid principal

proceeds shall be insufficient to pay in full the entire
principal amount so unpaid, then ratably to each Holder
according to the aggregate principal amount of Notes held
by each;

(E) Fifth, to the payment of the Make-Whole
Amount, if any, then unpaid with respect to the
outstanding Notes and, in case such proceeds shall be

held by each;

(F) Sixth, to the payment of all other amounts
owed with respect to the Notes and the other Secured
Obligations and, in case such proceeds shall be
insufficient to pay in full such amounts, then ratably to
each holder thereof; and

(G) Seventh, to Lime or to whomever else may be
entitled thereto pursuant to the Transaction Documents
or applicable law.

exercising any cure right pursuant to Article 6 of the Intercreditor

If no Account shall be designated, such amount shall be deposited into the
Project Revenue Account and applied as herein provided.

2.10 Permitted Investments. 

The Disbursement Agent shall invest any cash held in any Account
from time to time in Permitted Investments. All such investments shall be
made so as to mature on or prior to the date or dates on which the
Disbursement Agent anticipates that funds therein will be required for
disbursements to be made hereunder (but the Disbursement Agent shall use
its best efforts to invest in Permitted Investments with the longest
available maturity consistent with such requirement). Any income or gain
realized as a result of any such investment shall be held as part of the
applicable Account and reinvested as provided in this Agreement until
disbursed in compliance with this Section 2. For purposes of any income tax
payable on account of any such income or gain, such income or gain shall be
for the account of the SPV. The Disbursement Agent shall have no liability
for any loss resulting from any such investment other than by reason of
its wilful misconduct or gross negligence. Any such investment may be
liquidated by the Disbursement Agent, in a manner intended to minimize any
loss of principal prior to maturity, whenever necessary to make any
deposit, distribution or transfer required by this Agreement. The
Disbursement Agent shall not be liable to any Person for any investment
loss resulting from any such liquidation of investments.

3.1 Appointment of Disbursement Agent; Powers and Immunities. 

(a) Appointment of Disbursement Agent. The Collateral Agent,

terms of this Agreement and such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and the SPV consents to such appointment.

(b) Duties and Responsibilities. The Disbursement Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly

foregoing, prior to satisfaction in full of the Secured Obligations,
the Disbursement Agent shall take all actions as the Collateral Agent
shall direct it in writing to perform in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. The Disbursement Agent shall not take any actions
hereunder except in accordance with such instructions and shall be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in
accordance with such instructions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained 
<PAGE> -14-<PAGE>
herein, the Disbursement Agent shall not be required to take any
action which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law or which
in its reasonable judgment would involve it in expense or liability
unless it has been furnished with adequate indemnity to its
reasonable satisfaction against such expense or liability. The
Disbursement Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth herein and those necessarily
incidental thereto, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities or duties on the part of the Disbursement Agent

representations or warranties made by any other Person contained in
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or in any
certificate or other document referred to or provided for herein or
therein, for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other document referred to or provided
for herein or therein, or for any failure by the SPV or the Collateral
Agent, to perform their respective obligations hereunder or
thereunder. Except as expressly stated in the Transaction
Documents, the Disbursement Agent shall not be required to ascertain

of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement, any
other Transaction Document, or any other document or agreement
contemplated hereby or thereby. The Disbursement Agent shall not be

proceeding hereunder or under any other Transaction Document or (ii)
responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
hereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own
gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

(d) Consultation with Experts, Obtaining Instructions, etc. 
Whenever in the administration of this Agreement the Disbursement
Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that a factual matter be
proved or established in connection with the Disbursement Agent's
taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such
matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof is herein
specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved or
established by a certificate of the SPV, the Collateral Agent or the
Lender required to be delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof. 
The Disbursement Agent may consult with counsel, accountants or
other experts, and any opinion of such counsel, accountants or other
experts shall be full authorization and protection in respect of any
action taken, suffered or omitted by the Disbursement Agent under
this Agreement in accordance therewith. The Disbursement Agent
shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the
administration of this Agreement from any court of competent
jurisdiction, or, prior to satisfaction in full of the Secured
Obligations, from the Collateral Agent. The Disbursement Agent shall
provide a copy of any certificate received pursuant to this Section
to the SPV, and shall inform the SPV in the event that it consults
with, or seeks the opinion of, any counsel, accountant, or other
expert, or seeks instructions from any court. The Disbursement Agent
may execute any of its duties hereunder through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or

The Disbursement Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any signature,
certificate, notice or other document (including any cable, telegram,
telecopy or telex) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons so long as
the Disbursement Agent confirms receipt of such certificate, notice or
other document by delivery of a written acknowledgment to the sender prior
to taking action in reliance thereon. The Disbursement Agent shall also be
entitled to rely upon advice of legal counsel, independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Disbursement Agent, and shall have no

Disbursement Agent, or any dispute, as to any amount to be
transferred or paid pursuant to this Agreement, the Disbursement
Agent is authorized and directed to retain in its possession the
amount in question until such uncertainty or dispute shall have been
resolved or settled or until it has been provided appropriate
indemnification, in either case to its satisfaction. The Disbursement
Agent shall not be liable to any Person on account of its exercise, in
good faith, of its rights under this Section 3.3(a).

Disbursement Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the
Collateral Agent, at any time prior to satisfaction in full of the Secured
Obligations. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Collateral Agent
shall have the right to appoint a successor Disbursement Agent. If no
successor Disbursement Agent shall have been appointed and shall have
accepted such appointment within sixty (60) days after the retiring
Disbursement Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the removal of the
retiring Disbursement Agent, then the retiring Disbursement Agent may
apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor; provided that any Disbursement Agent so appointed shall
immediately and without further act be superseded by a Disbursement Agent
appointed by the Collateral Agent. Upon the execution and delivery of an
instrument accepting its appointment as Disbursement Agent hereunder by
the successor Disbursement Agent, (a) without further act, deed or
conveyance, such successor Disbursement Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, obligations and
duties of the retiring 
<PAGE> -16-<PAGE>
Disbursement Agent, and the retiring Disbursement Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (b) the retiring
Disbursement Agent shall promptly transfer all Accounts within its
possession or control to the possession or control of the successor
Disbursement Agent and shall execute and deliver such notices,
instructions and assignments as may be necessary or desirable to transfer
more fully and certainly the rights, powers, privileges, obligations and
duties of the Disbursement Agent with respect to the Accounts to the
successor Disbursement Agent. After the retiring Disbursement Agent's

respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as Disbursement Agent.

This AMENDMENT AGREEMENT (this Agreement or this
Amendment), dated as of August 1, 1994, is entered into by and
among DRAVO CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation (Dravo),
DRAVO LIME COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (Lime), DRAVO BASIC
MATERIALS COMPANY, INC., an Alabama corporation (Basic,
together with Lime referred to herein as the Companies), FIRST
ALABAMA BANK (FAB), PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (formerly
known as Pittsburgh National Bank) (PNC), CONTINENTAL BANK
(formerly known as Continental Bank N.A.) (Continental), THE
PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA (acting through
Prudential Capital Group, Prudential; FAB, PNC, Continental and
Prudential herein collectively referred to as Lenders and each
a Lender), and FAB, as agent for the Lenders (in such capacity,
together with its successors and assigns, the Agent).

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

(1) The Companies, Dravo and the Lenders have
entered into an Override Agreement, dated as of January 21,
1992, as amended by the First Amendment to Override Agreement,
dated March 10, 1993, and the Second Amendment to Override
Agreement, dated as of March 7, 1994 (as so amended, the
Override Agreement). In addition, the Companies, the Agent and
the Lenders have entered into an Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of January 21, 1992, as
amended by the First Amendment to Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of March 7, 1994 (as so
amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement). Capitalized terms
used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned
to such terms in the Override Agreement, as amended hereby.

(2) Lime has entered into a lime supply agreement,
dated June 21, 1993 (the OPCO Agreement), with Ohio Power
Company, an Ohio corporation. In order to fulfill its obligations
under the OPCO Agreement, Lime requires additional production
facilities (the New Project) at its Black River Facility. In
addition, to the extent that the New Project has capacity beyond
that needed to service the OPCO Agreement, Lime plans to utilize
the New Project to service other lime supply agreements in
order to benefit from the cost savings to be realized from the
efficiency of the New Project's equipment.
<PAGE> -1-<PAGE>
(3) To finance a portion of the cost of constructing
the New Project, the Lenders have agreed to increase their
commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement by $6,000,000
and to extend the maturity thereof, and Prudential, acting
through Prudential Power Funding Associates (PruPower), has
agreed to purchase up to $50,000,000 of promissory notes to be
issued by Lime SPV.

(4) The parties hereto desire to amend the Revolving
Credit Agreement, the Override Agreement and certain other
Operative Documents to reflect the financing of the New
Project and that, among other things, additional property is
being pledged to the Lenders as collateral security.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the

the $75,000,000.00 Revolving Line of Credit
payable quarterly in arrears on the fifth
business day following each calendar quarter
during the term of this Agreement.

(viii) The following new Section 1.9 is added at the
end of Article I:

Section 1.9 Extension of Maturity Date. (a) 
At least 10 but not more than 60 days before each
June 30, the Borrowers may, by delivering a written
request to the Agent (each such request being
irrevocable), request that each Lender extend for
one year the Maturity Date with respect to such
Lender's Revolving Line of Credit commitment and
commitment to issue (or cause to be issued) Letters
of Credit (such commitments referred to herein
collectively, with respect to each Lender, as such
Lender's "Commitment"). The Agent shall, upon its
receipt of such a request, promptly notify each
Lender thereof, and request that each Lender
<PAGE> -22-<PAGE>
promptly advise the Agent of its approval or
rejection of such request.

(b) Upon receipt of such notification from
the Agent, each Lender may (but shall not be
required to), in its sole and absolute discretion
(notwithstanding any covenant or other provision
contained herein), agree to extend the Maturity
Date with respect to its Commitment for a period of
one year, and shall (should it determine to do so),
no later than 60 days following its receipt of such
notification, notify the Agent of its approval
concerning such request. If any Lender shall not
so notify the Agent, such Lender shall be deemed
not to have consented to such request. The Agent
shall thereupon provide written notice (the
"Extension Notice") to the Borrowers and all of the
Lenders as to the Lenders, if any, that have
consented to such request. If, within such 60-day
period, any Lender has elected not to extend (or
failed to notify the Agent of its consent to
extend) its Commitment, then each Lender that has
agreed to extend the Maturity Date may, in its sole
and absolute discretion, within ten business days
after its receipt of the Extension Notice, withdraw
its previous approval concerning such request.

(c) The Commitment of each Lender that
agrees to extend the Maturity Date shall be
extended for a period of one year, commencing on
the then-scheduled Maturity Date. If any Lender
has elected not to extend (or failed to notify the
Agent of its consent to extend) its Commitment,
such Lender's Commitment shall terminate
automatically on the then-scheduled Maturity
Date, and the Borrowers shall be required to repay
on such date the outstanding principal amount of
all Revolving Line of Credit loans, if any, made by
such Lender, together with accrued interest, fees
and all other amounts then payable to such Lender
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however,
that the Borrowers may, provided that no Default
or Event of Default shall then have occurred and
be continuing, demand that such Lender assign to
one or more financial institutions designated by
the Borrowers (a "Replacement Lender"), on terms
and conditions reasonably acceptable to such
Lender, all (but not less than all) of such Lender's
Commitment and the Revolving Line of Credit
advances owing to it, which assignment shall be
consummated within 45 days after such Lender
notifies the 
<PAGE> -23-<PAGE>
Agent of its election not to extend its Commitment
(or, if such Lender fails to notify the Agent of its
consent to extend, within 45 days after such
Lender is deemed to have failed to consent to such
extension). The Borrower shall, as a condition to
the effectiveness of any such assignment, cause
the replacement of all Letters of Credit issued by
such Lender with Letters of Credit issued by the
Replacement Lender. The Borrowers shall notify
the Lenders of any proposed Replacement Lender
no later than ten days prior to the effectiveness
of any such assignment. If, prior to the end of
such 45-day period, any Lender that has agreed to
extend the Maturity Date notifies the Borrowers
that any proposed Replacement Lender is not
acceptable to it, such Lender may withdraw its
previous approval concerning such extension.

(b) Amendment to Article V. Section 5.1(b)(1) is
amended by inserting the phrase "and in the Note
Purchase Agreement" immediately following the phrase
"the representations and warranties of the Dravo
Parties set forth herein".

(c) Amendments to Article IX. Article IX shall be
amended as follows:

(i) The first sentence of Section 9.1(a) is
amended in its entirety to read as follows:

Lenders agree as between themselves that upon
receipt of a request for an advance hereunder by
Borrowers (or either of them), and so long as there
shall exist no Event of Default or Default, FAB will
advance 31.88% of such request, PNC will advance
24.64% of such request, Continental will advance
28.99% of such request and Prudential will advance
14.49% of such request (each such percentage
referred to herein as such Lender's "Percentage";
provided, however, that in no event shall the
aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Line
of Credit loans made hereunder by Lenders exceed
$75,000,000.00.

(ii) Section 9.1 is further amended by adding the
following new subsections (c), (d) and (e) at the end
thereof:

(c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b)
above, in the event that any Lender does not agree
to provide any funds (to the extent that such
funds are not otherwise 
<PAGE> -24-<PAGE>
available to be borrowed by the Borrowers from
such Lender pursuant to this Agreement) for (i) the
cure of any defaults pursuant to Article 6 of the
Project Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) the
purchase price of any assets sold by Lime SPV in
connection with the exercise by the Lenders of any
right of first refusal pursuant to Section
5.03(a)(iv)(2) of the Override Agreement, the
Lenders that agree to provide such funds (the
"Funding Lenders") shall advance such funds on a
pro rata basis, based on the proportion of each
Funding Lender's Commitment to the aggregate
amount of the Commitments of the Funding Lenders. 
So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, notwithstanding Section 11.7,
any amounts of principal prepaid or repaid by the
Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement shall be
applied, first, to the repayment of all advances
made by the Funding Lenders pursuant to clauses
(i) and (ii) above (on a pro rata basis based on the
amount of advances made by each of the Funding
Lenders) and second, to the repayment of all other
amounts owing to the Lenders hereunder (on a pro
rata basis in accordance with their respective
percentages set forth in subsection (a) above), in
each case otherwise in accordance with this
Agreement. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, any amounts
of principal prepaid or repaid by the Borrowers or
otherwise realized pursuant to any Security
Document shall be applied on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the percentages of the Lenders
set forth in subsection (a) above. Any funds
provided by a Funding Lender pursuant to clauses
(i) and (ii) above shall be deemed to be a Revolving
Line of Credit advance made by such Lender to the
Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall be obligated to
repay such advances pursuant to the terms
hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, any
purchase of assets pursuant to clause (ii) above
shall be made on behalf of Lime, and Lime shall be
the legal and beneficial owner of such assets. 

(d) In connection with any advances made
by the Funding Lenders pursuant to subsection (c)
above, the Companies shall execute such
agreements, documents and instruments (including,
without limitation, additional promissory notes),
and take such further actions, as any Funding
Lender may reasonably request.
<PAGE> -25-<PAGE>
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in order to effect the
cure of any default pursuant to Article 6 of the
Project Intercreditor Agreement, the Lenders shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to advance
funds on behalf of the Borrowers and to make any
payments directly to any Persons (other than the
Borrowers) to the extent necessary to cure such
default. 

(d) Amendment to Article XI. The third sentence
of Section 11.1 is amended by adding the phrase "provided,
however, that until such time as the Additional Notes are
paid in full and cancelled, all payments and prepayments
of principal by the Borrowers shall be applied, first, to
the payment of any amounts of principal outstanding
under the Additional Notes and, second, to the payment
of any amounts of principal outstanding under the other
Revolving Notes" immediately preceding the period at the
end thereof.
