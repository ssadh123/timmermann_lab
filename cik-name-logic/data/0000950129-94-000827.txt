FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

VERDICT IN FAVOR OF NL

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- December 1, 1994 -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE:NL)
announced today that a jury sitting in a Pennsylvania state court reached a
verdict in favor of NL in a class action suit. NL stated that plaintiffs in
the action had sought compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and
property damage from NL and the current owner of a lead plant for injuries
allegedly caused by emissions from the plant. The current owner of the plant
settled the case prior to the jury being charged.

NL stated that the action had been brought on behalf of a class of
over 7,500 persons who resided or worked near the plant from 1960 through the
present. NL sold the plant to its current owner in 1979.

NL understands that the plaintiffs will have 30 days following an
entry of a judgment in NL's favor to appeal the decision. NL intends to
vigorously defend any appeal as well as any other attempts by the plaintiffs to
disturb the jury's verdict.

NL Industries, Inc. is a major international producer of titanium
dioxide pigments and specialty chemicals.
