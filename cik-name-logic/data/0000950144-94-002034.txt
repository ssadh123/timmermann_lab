ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On November 15, 1994 (the "Closing Date"), First Financial Management
Corporation ("FFMC") acquired all of the stock of Western Union Financial
Services, Inc. ("Western Union") as well as certain assets of Western Union's
parent company, New Valley Corporation ("New Valley"), relating to the money
transfer business conducted by Western Union. The acquisition was consummated
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement between New Valley and FFMC dated as of
October 20, 1994, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto dated November 14, 1994
(the "Purchase Agreement"). FFMC intends to use the assets of Western Union
and the other assets acquired to continue conducting Western Union's money
transfer business.

In connection with its shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed
on November 4, 1994, FFMC also filed a contemporaneous Current Report on Form
8-K, dated November 4, 1994, to report information about the planned
acquisition of Western Union prior to consummation of the acquisition so as to
comply with disclosure requirements applicable to such Registration Statement.
Substantially the same information required by Form 8-K with respect to the
completed acquisition has been previously reported by FFMC in its Current
Report on Form 8-K filed on November 4, 1994, including the financial
statements of Western Union, pro forma financial information, and a copy of the
Purchase Agreement. An additional Report on Form 8-K containing the previously
reported information is not required. This Current Report is therefore being
filed solely as a supplemental report to confirm the consummation of FFMC's
acquisition of Western Union and to report certain adjustments made by
Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement.

As previously reported, the Purchase Agreement provided for a cash
purchase price of $893,223,000 plus the assumption by FFMC of the Western Union
Pension Plan. Of the cash portion of the purchase price, $593,223,000 was paid
on the Closing Date and $300,000,000 will be paid in January 1995 on a date to
be specified by FFMC (the "Second Closing Date"). On the Second Closing Date,
New Valley will transfer to FFMC all of its interests in the Western Union name
and trademark and other marks relating to the money transfer business of
Western Union. By mutual agreement as reflected in Amendment No. 1 to the
Purchase Agreement, the transfer of certain of these marks initially scheduled
to occur at the first closing was deferred until the Second Closing Date and
the deferred portion of the cash purchase price was increased from $250,000,000
to $300,000,000. This had no effect on the previously filed pro forma
financial statements which assumed the completion of the entire transaction.

In connection with its acquisition of Western Union and related
assets, FFMC borrowed $493,000,000 initially and expects to borrow
approximately $300,000,000 in January 1995 under its revolving bank credit
facility with The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), as agent for the
banks that are signatories thereto. Contemporaneously with the filing of this
Current Report, FFMC is filing an amendment to its previously referenced shelf
Registration Statement to indicate its intent to proceed with a public offering
of convertible debentures in aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000, the
proceeds of which are expected to be used to reduce the bank indebtedness
incurred to finance FFMC's acquisition of Western Union and related assets.

Loans, together with the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans

purpose Interest Periods described in different lettered clauses of the

(b) At any time from the date on which a Swingline Loan is
made until such Swingline Loan shall have been paid in full, the Swingline Bank
may, and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers (which power is
coupled with an interest) the Swingline Bank to, deliver, on behalf of the
Company, to the Agent a notice of borrowing of Syndicated Loans that are Base
Rate Loans in an amount equal to the then unpaid principal amount of such
Swingline Loan. The proceeds of such Syndicated Loans shall be applied solely
to refinance such Swingline Loan and the Company shall be deemed to have
advanced the proceeds of such Syndicated Loans to FFB. In the event that the
power of the Swingline Bank to give such notice of borrowing on behalf of the
Company is terminated for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation,
a termination resulting from the occurrence of an event specified in clause (g)
or (h) of Section 9 hereof with respect to the Company), or the Swingline Bank
is otherwise precluded for any reason whatsoever from giving a notice of
borrowing on behalf of the Company as provided in the preceding sentence, each
Bank shall, upon notice from the Swingline Bank, promptly purchase from the
Swingline Bank a participation in (or, if and to the extent specified by the
Swingline Bank, a direct interest in) such Swingline Loan in the amount of the
Base Rate Loan it would have been obligated to make pursuant to such notice of
borrowing. Anything in Sections 2.02(a) or 4.05 hereof to the contrary
notwithstanding, each Bank shall, not later than 4:00 p.m. New York time on the
Business Day on which such notice is given (if such notice is given by 2:15
p.m. New York time) or 9:00 a.m. New York time on the next succeeding Business
Day (if such notice is given after 2:15 p.m. New York time), make available the
amount of the Base Rate Loan to be made by it (or the amount of the
participation or direct interest to be purchased by it, as the case may be) to
the Agent at the account specified in Section 2.02(a) hereof and the amount so
received by the Agent shall be made available to the Swingline Bank by
depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of the
Swingline Bank maintained with Chase at the Principal Office designated by the
Swingline Bank. Promptly following its receipt of any payment in respect of a
Swingline Loan, the Swingline Bank shall pay to each Bank that has acquired a
participation in such Loan such Bank's proportionate share of such payment.

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding
(including, without limitation, in Section 6.02 hereof), the obligation of each
Bank to make its Base Rate Loan (or purchase its participation or direct
interest in the Swingline Loan, as the case may be) pursuant to this

Credit Agreement

Section 2.02(b) is unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
shall not be subject to set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment that such
Bank may have or have had against the Company, FFB, the Agent, the Swingline
Bank or any other Bank and, without limiting any of the foregoing, shall be
unconditional irrespective of (i) the occurrence of any Default, (ii) the
financial condition of the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company,
the Agent, the Swingline Bank or any other Bank or (iii) the termination or
cancellation of the Commitments; provided that no Bank shall be obligated to
make such Base Rate Loan (or to purchase its participation or direct interest
in the Swingline Loan) if, at the time of the making of such Swingline Loan,
the Swingline Bank had actual knowledge that a Default had occurred and was
continuing. The Company and FFB agree that any Bank so purchasing a
participation (or direct interest) in such Swingline Loan may exercise all
rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct holder of a
Swingline Loan in the amount of such participation.

If any Bank shall default in its obligation to make its Base
Rate Loan to refinance any Swingline Loan (or purchase its participation or
direct interest in such Swingline Loan, as the case may be) pursuant to the
first paragraph of this Section 2.02(b), then for so long as such default shall
continue, the Agent shall at the request of the Swingline Bank, withhold from
any payments received by the Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account
of such Bank the amount so in default and the Agent shall pay the same to the
Swingline Bank up to the amount and in satisfaction of such defaulted
obligation, which amount the Swingline Bank will apply to the repayment of the
principal of such Swingline Loan (if such Bank defaulted in its obligation to
make its Base Rate Loan) or otherwise to the purchase of the participation or
direct interest to be purchased by such Bank.

2.03 Changes of Commitments; Extension of Commitment 
Termination Date.

purpose the amount of any Money Market Loans or Swingline Loans shall be deemed
to be a pro rata (based on the Commitments) utilization of each Bank's
Commitment) at any time or from time to time in accordance with the provisions
of Sections 4.04 and 4.05 hereof.

(2) The Company shall have the right to terminate the
Commitment of any Bank ("Terminated Bank") in whole but not in part at any time
upon not less than five Business Days' notice to the Terminated Bank and the
Agent; provided that (i) the

Credit Agreement

- 26 -

aggregate amount of the Commitments of all Terminated Banks pursuant to this
provision shall not exceed $100,000,000; (ii) after giving effect to such
termination the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans shall not
exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments; (iii) no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing at the time of any such termination; (iv) (A) no
Loan shall be outstanding hereunder at the time of such termination or (B) if
any Loan is outstanding hereunder at such time, then the consent of the
Majority Banks to such termination shall have been obtained; and (v) all
principal of, and interest on, the Loans made by the Terminated Bank, and all
other amounts then owing to such Terminated Bank hereunder (including, without
limitation, any amounts payable under Section 5.05 hereof), shall be paid at
the time of such termination; provided further that, at any one time during the
one-year period following the Restatement Date, the Company shall have the
right to terminate the Commitment of any one Bank having a Commitment not in
excess of $50,000,000 without complying with clause (iv) above so long as at
the time of such termination the Company shall have unsecured, unguaranteed
long-term senior debt securities outstanding with a rating by Moody's of not
less than Baa3 and also by S&P of not less than BBB- and the Company shall not
be on "CreditWatch-negative" by S&P or under review for downgrade by Moody's.

(b) Mandatory. The aggregate amount of the Commitments shall
be automatically reduced to zero on the Commitment Termination Date.

(c) Extension of Commitment Termination Date. The Company
may, by notice to the Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy thereof to
each of the Banks) not less than 60 days and not more than 150 days prior to
the date one year prior to the Commitment Termination Date then in effect (the
"Current Termination Date"), request that the Commitment Termination Date be
extended to the date falling one year after the Current Termination Date;
provided that in no event may the Company request more than two such extensions
pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) after the Restatement Date. If the Company
shall so request such an extension, each Bank, acting in its sole discretion,
may, by notice to the Company and the Agent not less than 30 days prior to the
date one year prior to the Current Termination Date (the "Consent Date" with
respect to such requested extension), advise whether or not such Bank agrees to
extend the Commitment Termination Date to the date falling one year after the
Current Termination Date; provided that any Bank that does not advise the Agent
and the Company on or before the Consent Date shall be deemed to have agreed to
such requested extension (each Bank that advises the Agent and the Company that
it does not agree to a requested extension is herein called a

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 31

- 27 -

"Non-Consenting Bank"). The election of any Bank to agree to such extension
shall not obligate any other Bank to agree.

The Company shall have the right on or before the Current
Termination Date, to replace each Non-Consenting Bank with one or more other
banks (which may include any Bank, each an "Additional Commitment Bank"), each
of which Additional Commitment Banks shall have entered into an agreement in
form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Agent pursuant to which
such Additional Commitment Bank shall undertake all or any portion of the
Commitment(s) of one or more Non-Consenting Banks (if any such Additional
Commitment Bank is a Bank, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Bank's
Commitment hereunder on such date). Each Additional Commitment Bank shall
thereupon become a "Bank" for all purposes of this Agreement.

If Banks holding Commitments (not including the Commitments of
the Additional Commitment Banks) that aggregate more than 66-2/3% of the
aggregate amount of the Commitments (not including the Commitments of the
Additional Commitment Banks) shall, by the Consent Date, have agreed (or be
deemed to have agreed as provided above) to extend the Current Termination
Date, then, effective as of the Consent Date, the Commitment Termination Date
shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Current Termination
Date (provided, if such date is not a Business Day, then such Commitment
Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Current
Termination Date shall not be effective unless (i) no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing either on the date of the notice requesting such
extension or on the Consent Date and (ii) each of the representations and
warranties of the Company in Section 7 hereof shall be true and complete in all
material respects on and as of each of the date of such notice and the Consent
Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as each such date (or, if
any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of
a specific date as of such specific date).

Even if the Current Termination Date is extended as aforesaid,
the Commitment of each Non-Consenting Bank shall terminate on the Current
Termination Date and all principal of and interest on the Loans made by each
such Non-Consenting Bank, and all other amounts then owing to such
Non-Consenting Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, any amounts
payable under Section 5.05 hereof), shall be paid on the then Current
Termination Date.

Credit Agreement

Without affecting the rights or obligations of the Company or
any Bank under this Section 2.03(c) (and without liability to the Company or
any Bank for any failure to do so), the Agent will endeavor to remind the
Company, not less than 90 days prior to the date one year prior to the Current
Termination Date, of any right the Company may have under this Section 2.03(c)
to extend the Current Termination Date.

If the Company causes one or more Additional Commitment Banks
to become party hereto at any time that there are Syndicated Loans outstanding,
the Company shall cause such Additional Commitment Banks to make Syndicated
Loans to the Company and/or shall prepay the then outstanding Syndicated Loans,
in accordance with Section 4.02 hereof, so that, after giving effect to such
Syndicated Loans and prepayments, the Syndicated Loans shall be held by the
Banks pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts of their Commitments.

If any Non-Consenting Bank is a Reference Bank (or whose
Applicable Lending Office is a Reference Bank, as the case may be), such
Reference Bank shall cease to be a Reference Bank at the close of business on
the date five (5) Business Days prior to the then Current Termination Date and,
if as a result of the foregoing, there shall be less than three Reference Banks
remaining, then the Agent (with the consent of the Company) shall, by notice to
the Company and the Banks, designate additional Bank(s) as Reference Bank(s),
so that there shall at all times be at least three Reference Banks.

If the Swingline Bank is a Non-Consenting Bank the provisions
of Section 2.10 hereof shall cease being available on the then Current
Termination Date unless another Bank shall have agreed to be the Swingline
Bank.

(d) No Reinstatement. The Commitments once terminated or
reduced may not be reinstated.

2.04 Money Market Loans.

(a) In addition to borrowings of Syndicated Loans, at any
time prior to the Commitment Termination Date, the Company may, as set
forth in this Section 2.04, request the Banks to make offers to make
Money Market Loans to the Company in Dollars. The Banks may, but
shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Company may, but
shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set
forth in this Section 2.04. Money Market Loans may be LIBOR Market
Loans or Set Rate Loans (each a "type" of Money Market Loan), provided
that: 

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 33

- 29 -

(i) there may be no more than fifteen different
Interest Periods for both Syndicated Loans and Money Market
Loans outstanding at the same time (for which purpose Interest
Periods described in different lettered clauses of the
definition of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be
different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous);

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Money
Market Loans, together with the aggregate principal amount of
all Syndicated Loans and Swingline Loans, at any one time
outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Commitments at such time; and

(iii) the Interest Period for any Money Market Loan
shall end on a date no later than the Commitment Termination
Date.

(b) When the Company wishes to request offers to make Money
Market Loans, it shall give the Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Banks) notice (a "Money Market Quote Request") so as to be received no
later than 11:00 a.m. New York time on (x) the fourth Business Day
prior to the date of borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a
LIBOR Auction or (y) the Business Day next preceding the date of
borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a Set Rate Auction (or, in
any such case, such other time and date as the Company and the Agent,
with the consent of the Majority Banks, may agree). The Company may
request offers to make Money Market Loans for up to three different
Interest Periods in a single notice (for which purpose Interest
Periods in different lettered clauses of the definition of the term
"Interest Period" shall be deemed to be different Interest Periods
even if they are coterminous); provided that the request for each
separate Interest Period shall be deemed to be a separate Money Market
Quote Request for a separate borrowing (a "Money Market Borrowing"). 
Each such notice shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit G 
hereto and shall specify as to each Money Market Borrowing: 

(i) the proposed date of such borrowing, which shall
be a Business Day;

(ii) the aggregate amount of such Money Market
Borrowing, which shall be at least $25,000,000 (or in larger
multiples of $500,000) but shall not cause the limits
specified in Section 2.04(a) hereof to be violated;

Credit Agreement

(iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable
thereto;

(iv) whether the Money Market Quotes requested for a
particular Interest Period are to be quotes for LIBOR Market
Loans or Set Rate Loans; and

(v) if the Money Market Quotes requested are to set
forth a Money Market Rate, the date on which the Money Market
Quotes are to be submitted if it is before the proposed date
of borrowing (the date on which such Money Market Quotes are
to be submitted is called the "Quotation Date").

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.04(b), no Money Market
Quote Request shall be given within five Business Days (or such other
number of days as the Company and the Agent, with the consent of the
Majority Banks, may agree) of any other Money Market Quote Request.

(c) (i) Each Bank may submit one or more Money Market
Quotes, each containing an offer to make a Money Market Loan in
response to any Money Market Quote Request; provided that, if the
Company's request under Section 2.04(b) hereof specified more than one
Interest Period, such Bank may make a single submission containing one
or more Money Market Quotes for each such Interest Period. Each Money
Market Quote must be submitted to the Agent not later than (x) 2:00
p.m. New York time on the fourth Business Day prior to the proposed
date of borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 10:00 a.m.
New York time on the Quotation Date, in the case of a Set Rate Auction
(or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Company and the
Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks, may agree); provided
that any Money Market Quote submitted by Chase (or its Applicable
Lending Office) may be submitted, and may only be submitted, if Chase
(or such Applicable Lending Office) notifies the Company of the terms
of the offer contained therein not later than (x) 1:00 p.m. New York
time on the fourth Business Day prior to the proposed date of
borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) 9:45 a.m. New York
time on the Quotation Date, in the case of a Set Rate Auction.
Subject to Sections 5.02(b), 5.03, 7.02 and 10 hereof, any Money
Market Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the consent of
the Agent given on the instructions of the Company. Except for
submissions to the Agent as provided above, no Bank shall, directly or
indirectly, communicate with any other Bank regarding the terms
contained in, or under consideration for, any Money Market Quote.
Chase shall not consider the terms of any

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 35

- 31 -

other Bank's Money Market Quote in deciding the terms of any Money 
Market Quote it may decide to submit to the Company.

(ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be substantially in the
form of Exhibit H hereto and shall specify:

(A) the proposed date of borrowing and the Interest 
Period therefor;

(B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan
for which each such offer is being made, which principal
amount shall be at least $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of
$500,000; provided that the aggregate principal amount of all
Money Market Loans for which a Bank submits Money Market
Quotes (x) may be greater or less than the Commitment of such
Bank but (y) may not exceed the principal amount of the Money
Market Borrowing for a particular Interest Period for which
offers were requested;

(C) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above
or below the applicable LIBO Rate (the " Money Market Margin")
offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a 
percentage (expressed to the nearest 1/10,000 of 1%) to be 
added to or subtracted from the applicable LIBO Rate;

(D) in the case of a Set Rate Auction, the rate of
interest per annum (expressed to the nearest 1/10,000 of 1%)
offered for each such Money Market Loan (the "Money Market
Rate"); and

(E) the identity of the quoting Bank.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Agent and the Company, no Money Market
Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or
propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the
applicable Money Market Quote Request and, in particular, no Money
Market Quote may be conditioned upon acceptance by the Company of all
(or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Money
Market Loan for which such Money Market Quote is being made.

(d) The Agent shall (x) in the case of a Set Rate Auction, as
promptly as practicable after the Money Market Quote is submitted (but
in any event not later than 10:15 a.m. New York time on the Quotation
Date) or (y) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, by 4:00 p.m. New York
time on the day a Money Market Quote is submitted, notify the Company
of the terms (i) of any Money Market Quote submitted

Credit Agreement

- 32 -

by a Bank that is in accordance with Section 2.04(c) hereof and (ii)
of any Money Market Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise
inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank
with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request. Any such
subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent and
the Company unless such subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted
solely to correct a manifest error in such former Money Market Quote.
The Agent's notice to the Company shall specify (A) the aggregate
principal amount of the Money Market Borrowing for which offers have
been received and (B) the respective principal amounts and Money
Market Margins or Money Market Rates, as the case may be, so offered
by each Bank (identifying the Bank that made each Money Market Quote).

(e) Not later than 11:00 a.m. New York time on (x) the third
Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of a
LIBOR Auction or (y) the Quotation Date, in the case of a Set Rate
Auction (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Company
and the Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks, may agree), the
Company shall notify the Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance of
the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) hereof (and
the failure of the Company to give such notice by such time shall
constitute nonacceptance) and the Agent shall promptly notify each
affected Bank. In the case of acceptance, such notice shall specify
the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that
are accepted. The Company may accept any Money Market Quote in whole
or in part (provided that, except for acceptances in part contemplated
by the penultimate sentence of this Section 2.04(e), any Money Market
Quote accepted in part shall be at least $5,000,000 or in larger
multiples of $100,000); provided that:

(i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money
Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set
forth in the related Money Market Quote Request;

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Money
Market Borrowing shall be at least $25,000,000 (or in larger
multiples of $500,000) but shall not cause the limits
specified in Section 2.04(a) hereof to be violated;

(iii) acceptance of offers may be made only in
ascending order of Money Market Margins or Money Market Rates,
as the case may be, in each case beginning with the lowest
rate so offered; and

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 37

- 33 -

(iv) the Company may not accept any offer where the
Agent has advised the Company that such offer fails to comply
with Section 2.04(c)(ii) hereof or otherwise fails to comply
with the requirements of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 2.04(a) hereof).

If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market
Margins or Money Market Rates, as the case may be, for a greater
aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers
are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of
Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall
be allocated by the Company among such Banks as nearly as possible (in
amounts of at least $5,000,000 or larger multiples of $100,000) in
proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers.
Determinations by the Company of the amounts of Money Market Loans
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(f) Any Bank whose offer to make any Money Market Loan has
been accepted shall, not later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on the
date specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such
Loan available to the Agent at account number NYAO-DI-900-9-000002
maintained by the Agent with Chase at the Principal Office in
immediately available funds, for account of the Company. The amount
so received by the Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, be made available to the Company by depositing the
same on the date received by the Agent, in immediately available
funds, in an account of the Company maintained with Chase at the
Principal Office designated by the Company.

(g) Except for the purpose and to the extent expressly stated
in Sections 2.03(a) and 2.05(a) hereof, the amount of any Money Market
Loan made by any Bank shall not constitute a utilization of such
Bank's Commitment.

2.05 Fees.

(a) Facility Fee. The Company shall pay to the Agent for
account of each Bank a facility fee on the amount of such Bank's Commitment
(whether or not utilized) for the period from and including the Restatement
Date to but not including the earlier of the date such Commitment is terminated
and the Commitment Termination Date, at a rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Facility Fee Percentage. Accrued facility fee shall be payable on
each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 38

- 34 -

such Commitment is terminated and the Commitment Termination Date.

(b) Money Market Quote Request Fee. The Company shall pay to
the Agent a solicitation fee equal to $2,000 for each Money Market Quote
Request made by the Company. Accrued solicitation fees shall be payable on
each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date the Commitments are
terminated and the Commitment Termination Date.

2.06 Lending Offices. The Loans of each type made by each
Bank shall be made and maintained at such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for
Loans of such type.

2.07 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure
of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor
shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on such
date, but neither any Bank nor the Agent shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank. The amounts
payable by the Company at any time hereunder and under the Notes to each Bank
shall be a separate and independent debt and each Bank shall be entitled to
protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and the Notes, and
it shall not be necessary for any other Bank or the Agent to consent to, or be
joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes. The
provisions of the preceding sentence shall apply mutatis mutandis to the
Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Bank to FFB.

2.08 Notes.

(a) The Syndicated Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced
by a single promissory note of the Company in substantially the form of Exhibit
A-1 hereto, dated the Restatement Date, payable to such Bank in a principal
amount equal to the amount of its Commitment as originally in effect and
otherwise duly completed. The date, amount, type and interest rate of each
Syndicated Loan made by each Bank to the Company, and each payment made on
account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Bank on its books
and, prior to any transfer of such Note held by it, endorsed by such Bank on
the schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that
any failure by any Bank to make such endorsements on the schedule attached to
the Note held by it shall not affect the validity of the Company's obligation
to repay the unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by such Bank with
interest thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Credit Agreement

(b) The Money Market Loans made by any Bank shall be

payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such
Bank on its books and, prior to any transfer of such Note held by it, endorsed
by such Bank on the schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof;
provided that any failure by any Bank to make such endorsements on the schedule
attached to the Note held by it shall not affect the validity of the Company's
obligation to repay the unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by such Bank
with interest thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) The Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Bank shall be
evidenced by a single promissory note of FFB in substantially the form of
Exhibit A-3 hereto, dated the Restatement Date, payable to the Swingline Bank
and otherwise duly completed. The date, amount and interest rate of each
Swingline Loan made to FFB, and each payment made on account of the principal
thereof, shall be recorded by the Swingline Bank on its books and, prior to any
transfer of such Note held by it, endorsed by the Swingline Bank on the
schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that any
failure by the Swingline Bank to make such endorsements on the schedule
attached to the Note held by it shall not affect the validity of FFB's
obligation to repay the unpaid principal amount of the Swingline Loans with
interest thereon in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Neither the Swingline Bank nor any Bank shall be entitled
to have its Notes subdivided, by exchange for promissory notes of lesser
denominations or otherwise, except in connection with a permitted assignment of
all or any portion of such Bank's Commitment, Loans and Notes pursuant to
Section 5.01(e) or Sections 11.06(b), (e) or (g) hereof.

2.09 Optional Prepayments and Conversions or Continuation of
Loans. Subject to Section 4.04 hereof, the Company shall have the right to
prepay Syndicated Loans and subject to the terms thereof, Money Market Loans
(without premium or penalty but subject to the provisions of Section 5 hereof),
in such order as it may select as between Syndicated Loans, and subject to the
terms thereof, Money Market Loans or to Convert Syndicated Loans of one type
into Syndicated Loans of another type or Continue Syndicated Loans of one type
as Syndicated Loans of the same type, at any time or from time to time,
provided that: (i) the Company shall give the Agent notice of each such

2.10 Swingline Loans.

(a) FFB may, on any Business Day prior to the Commitment
Termination Date, request the Swingline Bank (i) to make an offer on such
Business Day to make a Swingline Loan (an "Uncommitted Swingline Loan"), or
(ii) to make a Swingline Loan (a "Committed Swingline Loan"), to FFB on such
Business Day in Dollars in the manner set forth in this Section 2.10; provided
that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Swingline Loans may not, at
any one time outstanding, exceed (i) the Swingline Amount or (ii) together with
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Syndicated Loans and Money Market
Loans, the aggregate amount of the Commitments at such time; provided further,
that Swingline Loans may not be outstanding for more than five (5) consecutive
Business Days. The Swingline Bank may, but shall have no obligation to, make
any such offer to make an Uncommitted Swingline Loan and FFB may, but shall
have no obligation to, accept any such offer to make an Uncommitted Swingline
Loan.

(b) When FFB wishes to request an offer from the Swingline
Bank to make an Uncommitted Swingline Loan, or a Committed Swingline Loan, on
the date (a "Swingline Borrowing Date") on which it proposes to borrow a
Swingline Loan (a "Swingline Borrowing"), it shall give the Swingline Bank
notice (a "Swingline Request"), which notice shall be effective only if
received by the Swingline Bank (unless the Swingline Bank shall otherwise
consent) no later than (i) 3:00 p.m. New York time, in the case of a Swingline
Borrowing in a principal amount up to but not exceeding $50,000,000, (ii) 2:00

and in larger multiples of $1,000,000).

(c) Upon receipt of a Swingline Request for an Uncommitted
Swingline Loan, the Swingline Bank may, but shall not be obligated to, submit a
Swingline Quote to FFB, which Swingline Quote shall contain an offer to make an
Uncommitted Swingline Loan in response to such Swingline Request. Each
Swingline Quote

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 41

must specify (i) the principal amount of the Swingline Borrowing for which such
offer is being made (which principal amount shall be at least $5,000,000 or a
larger multiple of $1,000,000) and (ii) a quote of a margin (the "Swingline
Margin") above the Federal Funds Rate which, when added to the Federal Funds
Rate, will be the interest rate per annum applicable to the Uncommitted
Swingline Loan to be borrowed.

(d) Upon receipt of a Swingline Quote in response to its
Swingline Request for an Uncommitted Swingline Loan, FFB shall within five
minutes of receipt of such Swingline Quote notify the Swingline Bank of its
acceptance or nonacceptance of such Swingline Quote; provided that a failure of
FFB so to notify the Swingline Bank shall be nonacceptance of such Swingline
Quote.

(e) Promptly upon FFB's acceptance of a Swingline Quote, and
within an hour of a Swingline Request for a Committed Swingline Loan, the
Swingline Bank shall make the amount of the Swingline Loan to be made by it on
such date available to FFB on such date by depositing the same, in immediately
available funds, in an account of FFB maintained with Chase at the Principal
Office designated by FFB. The Swingline Bank shall thereupon promptly notify
the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Banks) that a Swingline Loan has
been made and the amount thereof.

(f) Anything in this Section 2.10 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Swingline Bank's obligation to make Committed Swingline
Loans may be terminated or reduced by the Swingline Bank by not less than 30

each type or Interest Period). Each reduction of Commitments in accordance
with Section 2.03(a)(1) hereof shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal
to $1,000,000. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
aggregate principal amount of Eurodollar Loans having the same Interest Period
shall be at least equal to $10,000,000 and, if the aggregate amount of
Eurodollar Loans having the same Interest Period would otherwise be in a lesser
aggregate principal amount for any period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans

herein, notices by the Company to the Agent of terminations or reductions of
Commitments, of borrowings, Conversions, Continuations and prepayments of
Syndicated Loans, of type of Syndicated Loans and of the duration of Interest

</TABLE>

Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the aggregate amount
of the Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing,
Conversion, Continuation or prepayment shall specify the Syndicated Loans to be
borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid and the aggregate amount (subject to
Section 4.04 hereof) and type of the Syndicated Loans to be borrowed,
Converted, Continued or prepaid (and, in the case of a Conversion, the type of
Syndicated Loans to result from such Conversion) and the date of borrowing,
Conversion, Continuation or prepayment (which shall be a Business Day) and, if
such Loans are Eurodollar Loans, the duration of the Interest Period therefor.
The Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the contents of each such notice.
In the event that the Company fails to select the type of Syndicated Loan, or
the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan, within the time
period and otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05, such Loan (if
outstanding as a Eurodollar Loan) will be automatically Converted into a Base
Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or
(if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then
outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan.

4.06 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Agent
shall have been notified by a Bank or the Company (the "Payor") prior to the
date on which the Payor is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (in the
case of a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder or (in the
case of the Company) a payment to the Agent for account of one or more of the
Banks hereunder (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment") which
notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 47

- 43 -

Payor does not intend to make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may
assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to) make the amount thereof available to
the intended recipient(s) on such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made
the Required Payment to the Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on
demand, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers
such amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day
and, if such recipient(s) shall fail promptly to make such payment, the Agent
shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the Payor, together
with interest as aforesaid.

4.07 Sharing of Payments, Etc.

(a) The Company agrees that, in addition to (and without
limitation of) any right of set-off, bankers' lien or counterclaim a Bank may
otherwise have, each Bank shall be entitled, at its option, to offset balances
held by it for account of the Company at any of its offices, in Dollars or in
any other currency, against any principal of or interest on such Bank's Loans,
or any other amount payable to such Bank hereunder, which is not paid when due
(regardless of whether such balances are then due to the Company), in which
case it shall promptly notify the Company and the Agent thereof, provided that
such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof.

(b) If any Bank shall obtain payment of any principal of or
interest on any Syndicated Loan made by it to the Company under this Agreement
through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or
similar right, debit pursuant to Section 4.01(b) hereof, or otherwise (other
than pursuant to Sections 2.03(a)(2), 2.03(c), 5.01(e) or 11.06 hereof), and,
as a result of such payment, such Bank shall have received a greater percentage
of the principal or interest then due hereunder by the Company to such Bank in
respect of Syndicated Loans than the percentage received by any other Bank, it
shall promptly purchase from the other Banks participations in (or, if and to
the extent specified by any such other Bank, direct interests in) the
Syndicated Loans made by such other Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the
case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time
as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit of
such excess payment (net of any expenses which may be incurred by such Bank in
obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the
unpaid principal and/or interest on the Syndicated Loans held by each Bank. To
such end

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 48

- 44 -

all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the
resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored.

(c) The Company agrees that any Bank purchasing a
participation (or direct interest) in the Syndicated Loans made by other Banks
(or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in accordance with Section
4.07(b) hereof may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim
or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank
were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such participation.

(d) Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and
retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other
indebtedness or obligation of the Company. If, under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim
in lieu of a set- off to which this Section 4.07 applies, such Bank shall, to
the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in
a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks entitled under this Section
4.07 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

Section 5. Yield Protection and Illegality.

5.01 Additional Costs.

(a) The Company shall pay directly to each Bank from time to
time such amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it
for any costs which such Bank determines are attributable to its making or
maintaining of any Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make any Fixed Rate
Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank
hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases in
costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional
Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

(i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to
such Bank under this Agreement or its Note in respect of any of such
Loans (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net
income of such Bank or of its Applicable Lending Office for any of
such Loans); or

(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or 
similar requirements (other than the Reserve Requirement utilized in 
the determination of the Fixed Rate for such Loan) relating to any
extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other
liabilities of, such Bank

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 49

- 45 -

(including such Loan or any deposits referred to in the definition of
"Fixed Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof), or any commitment of such
Bank (including the Commitment of such Bank hereunder); or

(iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or
any of its Notes (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities)
or its Commitments.

If any Bank requests compensation from the Company under this Section 5.01(a),
the Company may, by notice to such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), suspend the
obligation of such Bank to make or Continue its Loans of the type with respect
to which such compensation is requested, or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into
a Loan of such type, until the Regulatory Change giving rise to such request
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof
shall be applicable).

(b) Without limiting the effect of the provisions of Section
5.01(a) hereof, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank
either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of
extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes Eurodollar
Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category
of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such Bank so elects by
notice to the Company (with a copy to the Agent), the obligation of such Bank
to make or Continue, or to Convert any Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan
hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in
effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be
applicable).

(c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions
of this Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the Company shall pay directly
to each Bank from time to time on request such amounts as such Bank may
determine to be necessary to compensate such Bank for any costs which it
determines are attributable to the maintenance by such Bank (or any Applicable
Lending Office), pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation,
directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) of any court or
governmental or monetary authority (i) following any Regulatory Change or (ii)
implementing any risk-based capital guideline or requirement (whether or not
having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply, therewith
would be unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by any government or
governmental or supervisory authority

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 50

- 46 -

implementing at the national level the Basle Accord, of capital in respect of
its Commitment or any of its Loans (such compensation to include, without
limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on assets or
equity of such Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office) to a level below that
which such Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office) could have achieved but for
such law, regulation, interpretation, directive or request).

(d) Each Bank will notify the Company of any event occurring
after the date of this Agreement that will entitle such Bank to compensation
under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable, but
in any event within 45 days, after such Bank obtains actual knowledge thereof;
provided that (i) if any Bank fails to give such notice within 45 days after it
obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Bank shall, with respect to
compensation payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any costs
(including, without limitation, Additional Costs) resulting from such event,
only be entitled to payment under this Section 5.01 for costs incurred from and
after the date 45 days prior to the date that such Bank does give such notice
and (ii) each Bank will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the
Loan of such Bank affected by such event if such designation will avoid the
need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole
opinion of such Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank, except that such Bank
shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending Office located in
the United States of America. Each Bank will furnish to the Company a
certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Bank for
compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01. Determinations
and allocations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 5.01 of the effect of
any Regulatory Change pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) hereof, or of the
effect of capital maintained pursuant to Section 5.01(c) hereof, on its costs
or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on
amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to
compensate such Bank under this Section 5.01, shall be prima facie evidence
thereof, provided that such determinations and allocations are made on a
reasonable basis.

(e) If any Bank (an "Affected Bank") claims compensation from
the Company under Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(c) hereof (without prejudice to any
amounts then due to such Bank under said Sections), or makes an election under
Section 5.01(b) hereof, the Company may exercise any one of the following
options:

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 51

- 47 -

(i) The Company may request one or more of the non-Affected
Banks to take over all (but not part) of such Affected Bank's then
outstanding Syndicated Loans and to assume all (but not part) of such
Affected Bank's Commitment and obligations hereunder. If one or more
Banks (each, an "Assenting Bank") shall so agree, pursuant to such
documentation as is satisfactory in form and substance to the Company,
such Affected Bank, each Assenting Bank and the Agent (x) the
Commitment to make Syndicated Loans of each Assenting Bank and the
obligations of such Assenting Bank with respect to Syndicated Loans
under this Agreement shall be increased by its respective share of the
Commitment to make such Loans and of the obligations of such Affected
Bank with respect to Syndicated Loans under this Agreement taken over
by such Assenting Bank and (y) each Assenting Bank shall make
Syndicated Loans to the Company, pro rata according to such Assenting
Bank's respective share of the Commitment of such Affected Bank to
make such Loans taken over by such Assenting Bank, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to such share of the outstanding principal
amount of such Loans of such Affected Bank and otherwise on the same
terms as such Loans, on a date mutually acceptable to the Assenting
Banks, such Affected Bank and the Company. The proceeds of such
Loans, together with funds of the Company, shall be used to prepay
such Loans of such Affected Bank, together with all interest accrued
thereon, and all other amounts owing to such Affected Bank hereunder
in respect of the Syndicated Loans and, upon such assumption by the
Assenting Banks and prepayment by the Company, such Affected Bank
shall cease to be a "Bank" for purposes of this Agreement in
respect of the Syndicated Loans and shall no longer have any
obligations hereunder in respect of the Syndicated Loans.

(ii) The Company may designate a bank acceptable to the Agent
to assume all (but not part of) the Commitment and the obligations of
each such Affected Bank hereunder, and to purchase the outstanding
Notes of such Affected Bank and such Affected Bank's rights hereunder
and with respect thereto (a "Replacement Bank"), in each case on a
date mutually acceptable to the Replacement Bank, such Affected Bank,
and the Company, without recourse upon, or warranty by, or expense to,
such Affected Bank, for a purchase price equal to the outstanding
principal amount of the Loans of such Affected Bank plus all interest
accrued thereon and all other amounts owing to such Affected Bank
hereunder, and upon such assumption and purchase by such Replacement
Bank, such Replacement Bank shall be deemed to be a "Bank" for 
purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Bank shall cease to be a
"Bank" for purposes of this Agreement and such

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 52

- 48 -

Affected Bank shall no longer have any obligations hereunder.

(iii) So long as no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company may terminate such Affected Bank's Commitment
and prepay all of such Affected Bank's Loans, together with all
interest accrued thereon, and all other amounts owing to such Affected
Bank hereunder (including, without limitation, all amounts payable
under Sections 5.01 and 5.05 hereof).

If any Affected Bank that ceases being a "Bank" for purposes of this Agreement
is a Reference Bank (or whose Applicable Lending Office is a Reference Bank, as
the case may be), such Reference Bank shall cease to be a Reference Bank and,
if as a result of the foregoing, there shall be less than three Reference Banks
remaining, then the Agent (with the consent of the Company) shall, by notice to
the Company and the Banks, designate additional Bank(s) as Reference Bank(s),
so that there shall at all times be at least three Reference Banks.

5.02 Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any Fixed
Base Rate for any Interest Period:

(a) the Agent determines (or any Bank that has outstanding a
Money Market Quote with respect to a LIBOR Market Loan determines),
which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest
rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of
"Fixed Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof are not being provided in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
determining rates of interest for any type of Fixed Rate Loans as
provided herein; or

(b) the Majority Banks determine (or any Bank that has
outstanding a Money Market Quote with respect to a LIBOR Market Loan
determines), which determination shall be conclusive, and notify (or
notifies, as the case may be), the Agent that the relevant rates of
interest referred to in the definition of "Fixed Base Rate" in Section
1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of interest for
Eurodollar Loans (or LIBOR Market Loans, as the case may be), for such
Interest Period is to be determined are not likely to cover adequately
the cost to such Banks (or such quoting Bank) of making or maintaining
such type of Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Company and each Bank prompt notice thereof, and
so long as such condition remains in effect, the

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 53

- 49 -

Banks (or such quoting Bank) shall be under no obligation to make additional
Eurodollar Loans (or a LIBOR Market Loan, as the case may be), to Continue
Eurodollar Loans or to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the
Company shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for
the outstanding Eurodollar Loans (or LIBOR Market Loans), either prepay such
Loans or Convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section
2.09 hereof.

5.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable
Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans or
LIBOR Market Loans hereunder, then such Bank shall promptly notify the Company
thereof (with a copy to the Agent) and such Bank's obligation to make or
Continue, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan shall be
suspended until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain a Eurodollar
Loan (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable),
and such Bank shall no longer be obligated to make any LIBOR Market Loan that
it has offered to make.

5.04 Treatment of Affected Loans under Certain Circumstances.
If the obligation of any Bank to make or Continue, or to Convert a Base Rate
Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan or LIBOR Market Loan is suspended pursuant to
Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof, such Bank's Eurodollar Loan or LIBOR Market Loan
shall be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the
then current Interest Period for its Eurodollar Loan or LIBOR Market Loan (or,
in the case of a Conversion required by Section 5.01(b) or 5.03 hereof, on such
earlier date as such Bank may specify to the Company with a copy to the Agent)
and, unless and until such Bank gives notice as provided below that the
circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof which gave rise to such
Conversion no longer exist:

(a) to the extent that such Bank's Eurodollar Loan or LIBOR
Market Loan has been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to such Bank's Eurodollar
Loan or LIBOR Market Loan shall be applied instead to its Base Rate
Loan; and

(b) a Loan which would otherwise be made or Continued by such
Bank as a Eurodollar Loan shall be made or Continued instead as a Base
Rate Loan and the Base Rate Loan of such Bank which would otherwise be
Converted into a Eurodollar Loan shall remain as a Base Rate Loan.

If such Bank gives notice to the Company (with a copy to the Agent) that the
circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 54

- 50 -

hereof which gave rise to the Conversion of such Bank's Eurodollar Loan or
LIBOR Market Loan pursuant to this Section 5.04 no longer exist (which such
Bank agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time
when Eurodollar Loans are then outstanding, such Bank's Base Rate Loans shall
be automatically Converted, on the first day of the next succeeding Interest
Period for such Eurodollar Loans so that, after giving effect thereto, to the
extent possible all Syndicated Loans held by the Banks are Eurodollar Loans.

5.05 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Agent for
account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank through the Agent, such
amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense which such Bank reasonably
determines are attributable to:

(a) any payment, prepayment or Conversion (other than
pursuant to Section 5.01(b) or 5.03 hereof) of a Fixed Rate Loan or a
Set Rate Loan made by such Bank for any reason (including, without
limitation, the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 9
hereof) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for
such Loan; or

(b) any failure by the Company for any reason (other than as
a consequence of the delivery by such Bank of the notice referred to
in Sections 5.01(a), 5.01(b), 5.02 or 5.03 hereof but including,
without limitation, the failure of any of the conditions precedent
specified in Section 6 hereof to be satisfied) to borrow a Fixed Rate
Loan or a Set Rate Loan (with respect to which, in the case of a Money
Market Loan, the Company has accepted a Money Market Quote) from such
Bank on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice
of borrowing given pursuant to Section 2.02 or 2.04(b) hereof.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall
include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
which otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or
Converted or not borrowed for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the
Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date specified

5.06 Withholding Tax Exemption; Etc. Each Bank which is

may be required from time to time, including, without limitation, any
certificate or statement of exemption required by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1441-4(a) or Section 1.1441-6(c) or any subsequent version thereof, properly
completed and duly executed by such Bank, to establish that such Bank is not
subject to withholding under Section 1441 or 1442 of the Code, or comparable
successor provisions, because payments to such Bank are effectively connected
with the conduct by such Bank of a trade or business in the United States of
America or exempt from United States tax under a provision of an applicable tax
treaty. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Company
shall not have any obligation to pay to such Bank any amount which the Company
is liable to withhold due to failure of such Bank to timely file with the

the Company to the Agent and the Banks in connection with this Agreement and

banking, trust or other business with the Company (and any of their affiliates)
as if it were not acting as the Agent, and Chase and its affiliates may accept
fees and other consideration from, the Company for services in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Banks.

10.05 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 11.03 hereof, but without
limiting the obligations of the Company under said Section 11.03) ratably in
accordance with the Commitments of the Banks (or, if the Commitments have been
terminated), ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the
Loans made by the Banks for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Basic Document or any other documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which the Company is
obligated to pay under Section 11.03 hereof, but excluding, unless a Default
has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses
incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder and excluding all
out-of-pocket expenses and costs of the Agent referred to in Section
11.03(a)(i) except to the extent that the Company is obligated to reimburse the
Agent for such expenses and costs) or the enforcement of any of the terms
hereof or thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Bank shall
be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified.

10.06 Non-Reliance on Agent and other Banks. Each Bank
agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the Agent or any
other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
or any of the other Basic Documents. The Agent shall not be required to keep
itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Company of this
Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or any other document referred to
or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 83

- 79 -

documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by
the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any of their affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agent or any
of its affiliates.

10.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required
of the Agent hereunder and under the other Basic Documents, the Agent shall in
all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and
thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from
the Banks of their indemnification obligations under Section 10.05 hereof
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action.

10.08 Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent
may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Company,
and the Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority
Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the
right to appoint a successor Agent which shall be a Bank or, with the prior
consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), any
other bank. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Banks' removal
of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks and
the Swingline Bank, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Bank or, with
the prior consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) any other bank which has an office in New York, New York with a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this
Section 10 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent.

10.09 Consents Under Basic Documents. Without the prior
consent of the Majority Banks, the Agent will not consent to any modification,
supplement or waiver under the Company Guarantee, provided that without the
prior consent of each Bank

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 84

- 80 -

and the Swingline Bank, the Agent will not release the Company from any of its
obligations under the Company Guarantee.

Section 11. Miscellaneous.

11.01 Waiver. No failure on the part of the Agent, any Bank
or the Swingline Bank to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of
dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or
any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any Note
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

11.02 Notices. All notices and other communications provided

and the other Basic Documents and the making of the Loans hereunder and (ii)
any amendment, modification or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement or

directors, officers, employees and agents from, and hold each of them harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred
by any of them arising out of or by reason of any investigation or litigation
or other proceedings (including any threatened investigation or litigation or
other proceedings) relating to any actual or proposed use by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of any of the Loans, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation or litigation or other proceedings (but
excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by
reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be
indemnified).

11.04 Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
modified only by an instrument in writing signed by the Company, the Agent and

Commitments, (ii) extend any date fixed for the payment of principal of or
interest on any Loan or any commitment fee or facility fee payable hereunder,

11.06 Assignments and Participations.

(a) A Borrower may not assign any of its rights or
obligations hereunder or under the Notes without the prior consent of all of
the Banks, the Swingline Bank and the Agent.

(b) Any Bank may assign any of its Loans, its Notes or its
Commitment (which Commitment assignment shall include such Bank's corresponding
obligations to the Swingline Bank under Section 2.02(b) hereof) with the prior
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Company and
the Agent; provided that (i) without the consent of the Company or the Agent,
any Bank may assign to another Bank all or (subject to clauses (iii) and (iv)
below) any portion of its Commitment, Notes or Loans; (ii) no such assignment
shall be made to any Person that is not a Bank until 10 Business Days after the
assigning Bank shall have transmitted to each other Bank notice of its proposal
to effect such assignment (which notice shall specify the amount of the
Commitment and Loans proposed to be assigned); (iii) the amount of any such
partial assignment of its Commitment shall be in a minimum amount of
$15,000,000 (or, in the case of an assignment to another Bank, $5,000,000); and
(iv) each such assignment by a Bank of its Commitment, its Note evidencing
Syndicated Loans and its Syndicated Loans shall be made in such manner so that
the same portion of its Commitment, such Note and its Syndicated Loans is
assigned to the respective assignee. Upon notice to the Company and the Agent
of an assignment by any Bank to any other Bank permitted by the preceding
sentence (which notice shall identify the assignee Bank and the amount of the
assigning Bank's Commitment or Loans assigned in detail reasonably satisfactory
to the Agent) and upon the effectiveness of any assignment consented to by the
Company and the Agent, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such
assignment (unless otherwise provided such assignment with the consent of the
Company and the Agent), the obligations, rights and benefits of a Bank
hereunder holding the Commitment (or portion thereof) as the case may be,
assigned to it (in addition to the Commitment or Loans, as the case may be,
theretofore held by such assignee) and in the event that an assignment of a
Bank's Commitment (or portions thereof) is made, the assigning Bank shall, to
the extent of such assignment, be released from the Commitment (or portions
thereof) so assigned. Upon each such assignment (other than an assignment
pursuant to Sections 2.03(c) or 5.01(e) hereof), the assigning Bank shall pay
the Agent an assignment fee of $2,500.

(c) A Bank may sell or agree to sell to one or more other
Persons a participation in all or any part of its Commitment, Syndicated Loans
or its Money Market Loans held by it or the Syndicated Loans or its Money
Market Loans made or to be

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 87

- 83 -

made by it, in which event each such participant shall not, except (in the case
of a participant that is a Bank) to the extent provided by Section 4.07(c)
hereof, have any rights or benefits under this Agreement or any Note (the
participant's rights against such Bank in respect of such participation to be
those set forth in the agreement (the "Participation Agreement") executed by
such Bank in favor of the participant). All amounts payable by the Company to
any Bank under Section 5 hereof shall be determined as if such Bank had not
sold or agreed to sell any participations in such Loan and as if such Bank were
funding all of such Loan in the same way that it is funding the portion of such
Loan in which no participations have been sold. In no event shall a Bank that
sells a participation be obligated to the participant under the Participation
Agreement to take or refrain from taking any action hereunder or under such
Bank's Note except that such Bank may agree in the Participation Agreement that
it will not, without the consent of the participant, agree to (i) the increase
in the amount or extension of the term, or the extension of the time or waiver
of any requirement for the reduction or termination, of such Bank's Commitment,
(ii) the extension of any date fixed for the payment of principal of or
interest on the related Loan or any portion of any fees payable to the
participant, (iii) the reduction of any payment of principal thereof, (iv) the
reduction of the rate at which either interest is payable thereon or (if the
participant is entitled to any part thereof) facility fee is payable hereunder
to a level below the rate at which the participant is entitled to receive
interest or facility fee (as the case may be) in respect of such participation,
or (v) except as contemplated by Section 10.09 hereof, release the Company from
any of its obligations under the Company Guarantee.

(d) A Bank may furnish any information concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank from time
to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants), subject, however, to the provisions of Section 11.12 hereof.

(e) In addition to the assignments and participations
permitted by the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.06, any Bank may
assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal
Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating
Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release
the assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder. The provisions of this
Section 11.06(e) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Swingline Loans made by
the Swingline Bank to FFB.

(f) Anything in this Section 11.06 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 88

- 84 -

of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire (by assignment, participation or
otherwise), and no Bank may assign or participate to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any interest in any Commitment or Loan.

(g) The Swingline Bank may not (except as provided in
Sections 2.02(b) and 11.06(e) hereof) assign or sell participations in all or
any part of its Swingline Loans or the Swingline Note; provided that, with the
prior consent of the Agent and the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Swingline Bank may assign to another Bank
all of its obligations, rights and benefits in respect of the Swingline Loans
and the Swingline Note. Upon the effectiveness of any such assignment, the
assignee shall have the obligations, rights and benefits of the Swingline Bank
hereunder holding the Swingline Loans and Swingline Note assigned to it.

11.07 Survival. The obligations of the Company
under Sections 5.01, 5.05 and 11.03 hereof, and the obligations of the Banks
under Section 10.05 hereof, shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the
termination of the Commitments and, in the case of any Bank that may assign any
interest in its Commitment or Loans hereunder, shall survive the making of such
assignment, notwithstanding that such assigning Bank may cease to be a "Bank"
hereunder.

11.08 Captions. The table of contents and captions and
section headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of
reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of
this Agreement.

11.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by
signing any such counterpart.

11.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Etc. This
Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the law of the State of New York. The Borrowers hereby submit to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and of any New York state court sitting in New York County
for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Borrower irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding
brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding

Credit Agreement
<PAGE> 89

- 85 -

brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

11.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE BORROWERS, THE
AGENT, THE SWINGLINE BANK AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

11.12 Confidentiality. Each Bank and the Agent agrees (on
behalf of itself and each of its directors, officers and employees) to use (and
to cause its affiliates and representatives to use) reasonable precautions to
keep confidential, in accordance with customary procedures for handling
confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound
banking practices, any non-public information supplied to it by each Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement which is identified by the Company as being
confidential at the time the same is delivered to the Banks or the Agent,
provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such information
(i) to the extent required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial process, or
after such information shall have become public (other than through a violation
of this Section 11.12), (ii) to counsel for any of the Banks or the Agent,
(iii) to bank examiners and regulators, auditors, accountants or other
professional advisors, (iv) to the Agent or any other Bank, (v) in connection
with any litigation to which any one or more of the Banks is a party or (vi) to
any assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) so long as
such assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) first
executes and delivers to the respective Bank and each Borrower a
Confidentiality Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit F hereto; and
provided finally that in no event shall any Bank or the Agent be obligated or
required to return any materials furnished by each Borrower. The obligations
of each Bank under this Section 11.12 shall supplement (and shall not supersede
and replace) the obligations of such Bank under the confidentiality letter in
respect of this financing (x) initially signed and delivered by such Bank to
the Company prior to the date hereof or (y) signed and delivered by any
prospective assignee to the assignor Bank and the Company on or after the date
of this Agreement.
