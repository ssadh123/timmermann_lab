TAMBRANDS REPORTS GAINS IN SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS
-------------------------------------------------

White Plains, New York--July 27, 1994--Tambrands Inc. (NYSE:TMB) today reported
improved sales and earnings for the second quarter of 1994. Edward T. Fogarty,
President and Chief Executive Officer, announced that net sales for the quarter
ended June 30, 1994 were $165,624,000, an increase of 11% over sales of
$149,041,000 in the second quarter of 1993. Improved sales were driven by
substantial gains in U.S. volumes as retail trade inventories stabilized after
declining sharply in recent quarters, particularly in the second quarter of
1993.

Net earnings were $20,007,000, or $0.54 per share, compared to a net loss of
$3,387,000, or $0.09 per share, in the same period of 1993 after a charge for
restructuring and other costs. Without the charge, second-quarter 1993 earnings
were $16,886,000.

Mr. Fogarty commented, "Tambrands has many challenges ahead, but the second
quarter was very encouraging. The U.S. tampon category continued to grow and
trade inventories stabilized for the period. In the future, we should see our
U.S. sales to the trade aligned much more closely with consumer purchases."
Outside of the United States, second-quarter 1994 volumes were somewhat below
the comparable period of 1993, due in part to the continuing competitive
environment in Europe.

Companywide marketing, selling and distribution expenses in the quarter were
above last year's levels, as Tambrands continued its increased marketing
spending. This increased spending was partially offset by reductions in
administrative expenses, driven principally by the Company's continuing overhead
reduction programs.

For the first six months of 1994, net sales were $304,797,000, compared to
$303,389,000 in the comparable period of 1993. Net earnings for the six months
were $42,051,000, or $1.13 per share, compared to earnings before the cumulative
effect of accounting change of $28,804,000, or $0.74 per share, in the first
half of 1993. Excluding the second-quarter 1993 restructuring charge, net
earnings for the first half of 1993 were $49,077,000.
