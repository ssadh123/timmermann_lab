Item 5. Other Events

BellSouth Corporation reported that growth in the company's
network services and wireless businesses, coupled with continued
cost containment, boosted second quarter earnings per share (EPS)
37 percent, to $1.04 from a reported 76 cents a year earlier.
Expenses in BellSouth's core telephone operations were essentially
flat, even though access line growth set a second quarter record.

The quarter was the first time in the company's history
that second quarter earnings topped $1.00 per share, and was
BellSouth's fourth quarter in a row of strong operating results.
Last year, the company reported second quarter EPS of 76 cents.
This included a one-time charge for debt refinancing of 11 cents.
Excluding the one-time charge in 1993, second quarter EPS on an
operating basis increased 20 percent in 1994.

Net income was $516.5 million in the second quarter of
1994, compared with $377.7 million in the same quarter of 1993
($433.1 million before the one-time debt refinancing charge).
Revenues of $4.13 billion were up 5.7 percent compared with the
second quarter a year earlier. Quarterly operating expenses
increased just 2.5 percent overall, and were essentially flat at
BellSouth Telecommunications.

BellSouth had solid growth in volumes in the second
quarter, including an increase of 133,600 access lines, best ever
for the April-May-June period, and 78 percent higher than the
74,900 increase in the second quarter of 1993. This means the
company grew the largest base of customer access lines in the
country at an annual rate of 4.2 percent, fueled by a healthy
Southeastern economy and marketing of second residential telephone
lines. Total long distance access minutes were up 8.1 percent
compared with the second quarter of 1993. A year ago, this key
volume measure increased 6.6 percent.

During the second quarter, BellSouth Telecommunications
sold its one millionth MemoryCall(R) service voice mailbox, and
sales of this value-priced telephone answering feature are at a
record pace.

BellSouth's cellular businesses continued their healthy
growth around the world, exceeding the 2 million total customer
milestone, based on BellSouth's ownership percentages. U.S.
cellular customers increased to 1,803,800 in the year since June
30, 1993, up 513,200, or 40 percent. Domestic cellular's
contribution of $68.2 million to net income was 78 percent higher
than in the second quarter of 1993.

In overseas markets, BellSouth's cellular customers
increased to 264,600 in the second quarter of 1994, 128 percent
more than a year ago. The second quarter of 1994 also saw
BellSouth's Optus consortium in Australia continue to win a
significant share of the long distance market through consumer
balloting.
