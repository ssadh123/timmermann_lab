INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Board of Directors
Automotive Natural Gas, Inc.
Milton, Wisconsin

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Automotive Natural Gas, Inc.
as of June 30, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of income,
stockholders' (deficit) and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 1993. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Automotive Natural Gas, Inc.
as of June 30, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year ended June 30, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Notes 5 and 13 to the
financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from
operations, its total liabilities exceeds its total assets and the bank has
filed suit against the Company demanding payment of the notes payable to the
bank. This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 13. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

AUTOMOTIVE NATURAL GAS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of business: Automotive Natural Gas, Inc. ("The Company") manufactures
and installs pumping stations for the refueling of vehicles directly from
natural gas pipelines and storage facilities. The Company also manufactures and
installs conversion kits in vehicles to allow the use of natural gas as an
alternative fuel source.

The Company's customers consist primarily of private companies and public
utilities located throughout the United States. Receivables on pumping stations
are due as work is completed on the station with the final 10% due upon
delivery. Receivables on conversion kits are due within 10 days of
installation.

A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies follows:

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
method) or market. Work in process and finished goods include materials, labor
and overhead.

Property and equipment: Property and equipment is carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. It is the Company's policy to
include amortization on assets acquired under capital leases with depreciation
on owned assets. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the
straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter
of the term of the lease or their estimated useful lives.

Intangible: The licensing agreement is being amortized by the straight-line
method over a 10 year period.

Estimated warranty claims: The Company sells its products with a warranty that
provides for repairs or replacements of any defective parts

Note 1. Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

for a one year period after the sale. At the time of the sale, the Company
accrues an estimate of the cost of providing the warranty based on prior
experience. The estimated warranty liability totaled $18,000 at June 30, 1993
and 1992, and is included in accrued expenses.

Note 2. Advance Billings on Sales Orders

The Company's policy is to bill customers varying percentages of the total
contract price to manufacture pumping stations at various stages of completion
of the contract. The accounts receivable balance includes $383,778 and $633,420
of these billings as of June 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Note 3. Composition of Inventories

The composition of inventories is as follows as of June 30,1993 and 1992:

1993 1992
Finished goods $ 448,562 $ 1,165,812
Work-in-process 395,241 591,570
Production materials and purchases held for resale 1,228,892 956,143

$ 2,072,695 $ 2,713,525

AUTOMOTIVE NATURAL GAS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 4. Licensing Agreement, Obligation Under Licensing Agreement and
Subsequent Event

In April, 1992 the Company entered into an agreement which granted the Company
exclusive rights to use technology in the manufacturing of conversion kits used
in motor vehicles allowing the use of compressed natural gas as an alternative
fuel source. The cost of this licensing agreement was $250,000. The Company
owed $50,000 and $175,000 under this agreement at June 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

On July 1, 1993, the Company purchased this technology under an agreement
requiring periodic payments of varying amounts totalling $250,000. The present
value of these payments using a discount rate of 10% is $213,600.

Note 5. Pledged Assets, Current Notes Payable and Long-term Debt

Current notes payable:
Note payable, Bank One, $500,000 line-of-credit, due on demand $ 500,000
Note payable, Bank One, $700,000 line-of-credit, due on demand 674,262
$ 1,174,262

Long-term debt:
Note payable, Bank One, final payment due September 1993 $ 1,485

Interest on the current notes payable is at a stated percentage over the bank's
reference rate adjusted daily. Reference rate was 6% at June 30, 1993.
Collateral on these notes includes a general business security agreement
covering substantially all assets of the Company, the guarantee of an
officer-stockholder and a life insurance policy on an officer-stockholder
assigned to the bank.

Note 5. Pledged Assets, Current Notes Payable and Long-term Debt (continued)

As of June 30, 1993, the Company was in violation of the bank loan agreements.

The bank demanded full payment on the notes in October 1993. On October 28,
1993, the bank served legal notice on the Company that it has filed suit for a
money judgment and replevin of personal property and equipment. If the Company
does not provide a proper answer within 20 days, the court may grant judgment
against the Company for the amounts outstanding under the notes payable to the
bank. A judgment awarding money may be enforced by garnishment or seizure of
property.

Note 6. Obligation Under Capital Leases

Property: This obligation includes the present value of the balance due in
future years for lease rentals for the use of land and building facilities
leased from a stockholder of the Company. The lease is payable in monthly
installments of principal and interest of approximately $6,200 until expiration
of the lease in June, 2002. Since the present value of the future minimum lease
payments at the beginning of the lease approximated the fair value of the
leased asset at that date, the lease is considered to be a capital lease and
has been so recorded with recognition of a leasehold interest in land and
building at a cost of $558,531 on which accumulated amortization totalled
$139,845 and $63,230 at June 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company sublet a portion of these facilities to an affiliated company under
a month-to-month agreement. Rental income under this agreement for the year
ended June 30, 1993 was $25,200. This agreement expires on October 31, 1993.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 6. Obligation Under Capital Leases (continued)

The future minimum lease payments under this capital lease are as follows.

Year Ending June 30, Amount
1994 $ 80,600
1995 74,400
1996 74,400
1997 74,400
1998 74,400

Total minimum lease payments $ 675,800

Less amounts representing interest 206,037
$ 469,763

Less current maturities 38 971
$ 430,792

Equipment: The obligation under capital leases also includes the present value
of the balance due for future lease rentals for the use of computer, telephone,
and office equipment. Since the present value of the future minimum lease
payments at the beginning of these leases approximated the fair value of the
leased assets at that date, these leases are considered to be capital leases
and have been so recorded. The equipment and related liabilities under the
capital leases were recorded at the present value of the future lease payments
due under the leases, as determined with various discount rates. The related
liabilities are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest until
the expiration of the leases.

The future minimum lease payments under these capital leases are as follows:

Note 6. Obligation Under Capital Leases (continued)

Year Ending June 30, Amount
1994 $ 71,388
1995 64,420
1996 41,327
1997 5,212
Total minimum lease payments $ 182,347

Less amount representing interest 24,274
$ 158,073

Less current maturities 58,305
$ 99,768

Note 7. Contingency

The Company had an open letter-of-credit with Bank One for $50,000.

Note 8. Lease Commitments

The Company has entered into agreements to lease automobiles, office equipment
and temporary office space.

The total minimum rental commitments under these operating leases are as
follows:

Year Ending June 30, Amount
1994 $ 18,268
1995 850
$ 19,118

The total rent expense for the year ended June 30,1993 was approximately
$141,809.

Note 9. Employee Fringe Benefits

The Company has a profit sharing plan with a 401(k) provision covering all
employees who meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the plan. The
amount the Company contributes to the plan is at the discretion of the
Company's Board of Directors. The total expense related to the plan for the
year ended June 30, 1993 was $16,431.

AUTOMOTIVE NATURAL GAS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 10. Income Taxes and Unused Net Operating Loss

At June 30, 1993, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1,142,000 available under provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code to be applied against future federal taxable income. These carryforwards
expire during 2007 and 2008. These carryforwards have been used to eliminate
the deferred income tax credits.

The resulting reduction in deferred income tax credits will be reversed when
the applicable net operating loss carryforwards are actually applied against
taxable income on the Company's income tax returns or when the loss
carryforwards expire.

The Company also has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately
$1,596,000 available under provisions of the Wisconsin Department of Revenue
Code to be applied against future Wisconsin taxable income. These carryforwards
expire during 2007 and 2008.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which significantly changes the recognition
and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Statement No. 109
requires that deferred taxes be recorded on a liability method and adjusted
when new tax rates are enacted. Deferred tax balances are presently recorded
using the rates in effect when the transactions giving rise to the deferred tax
occur, and deferred tax balances are not adjusted when tax rates change. The
Company is required to adopt Statement No. 109 beginning with the year ended
June 30, 1994, although earlier adoption is permitted. The Statement provides
that the effect of its adoption may be recorded entirely in the year of
adoption or retroactively by restating one or more prior years.

Note 10. Income Taxes and Unused Net Operating Loss (continued)

The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the effect Statement No.
109 may have on the accompanying financial statements, or whether to restate
any of the prior years. However, based on its current assessment, the Company
does not believe the adoption of Statement No. 109 will materially affect the
accompanying financial statements.

Note 11. Major Customers

Net sales for the year ended June 30, 1993 include sales to the following major
customers (each of which accounted for 10% or more of the total net sales of
the Company).

Customer A $ 3,975,447
Customer B $ 3,407,800

Note 12. Accounting Change

In 1993, the Company changed its depreciation method for equipment, fixtures
and vehicles from an accelerated method to the straight-line method.

The effect of this change in accounting method was to increase net income by
$72,398 in 1993. The change had no income tax effect due to net operating loss
carryforwards.

The Company believes the straight-line method of depreciation will more
accurately reflect the economic depreciation of the equipment.

Note 13. Management's Plans for Future Operations

As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred
losses from operations resulting in cash flow problems and its total
liabilities exceed its total assets by approximately $1,750,000 as of June
30,1993.

- 9 -
<PAGE>
AUTOMOTIVE NATURAL GAS, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 13. Management's Plans for Future Operations (continued)

Much of its cash flow and working capital problems are also due to the
significant growth in sales over the past few years.

Management instituted a cost reduction program during August 1993. The backlog
of sales as of June 30,1993 was approximately $1,970,000 and the Company has
received additional orders for refueling stations from July 1, 1993 through
October 28, 1993 of approximately $1,530,000. In 1993, the Company estimates it
spent approximately $500,000 (unaudited) to reengineer its refueling stations
which management believes will improve margins on this product. Management
believes these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability.

However, as discussed in Note 5, the Company is in violation of its bank loan
agreements and has not been able to work out arrangements with its bank
regarding a continuing lending relationship. The bank has sued the Company
demanding payment of these loans. To date, management has not been able to find
another lender to replace its current lender and to provide financing under a
plan which will provide for the Company's needs. As a result of this situation,
the Company is seeking alternatives and has entered into negotiations regarding
selling the Company or its operations.

Note 14. Receivable, Officer-stockholder

The receivable from an officer who is the majority stockholder substantially
arose in 1990 when a major addition was made to a building which the Company
leases from this individual. The receivable arose because the total cost of the
addition exceeded the amount borrowed to finance the addition.

The original intent of this stockholder was to repay this advance over 15
years; however, Note 14. Receivable, Officer-stockholder (continued)

during the year ended June 30,1993, his ability to repay was diminished due to
the deteriorated financial condition of the Company which raises concerns about
the Company's ability to make the monthly rent payments to the stockholder.
Additionally, there are the potential ramifications of the stockholder's
personal guarantee on the Company's notes payable to the bank, which is also
the mortgage holder on this property. Also, this receivable is not evidenced by
a signed note. Accordingly, this receivable has been presented on the
accompanying balance sheet as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

EDO Corporation
Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements
Introduction

Pursuant to an Agreement (the "Agreement") dated December 2, 1993 between
Automotive Natural Gas, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation ("ANGI") and EDO
Automotive Natural Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("EDO"), EDO acquired
substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of ANGI. EDO is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of EDO Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDO Corporation, a New York corporation.
The assets acquired include the inventory, machinery, intellectual property and
other assets associated with the design and manufacture of compressed natural
gas filling stations, dispensers and automotive conversion kits. The negotiated
consideration, using available cash, was $68,000 plus the assumption of certain
liabilities which liabilities are in excess of the value of the acquired assets
by approximately $2.6 million. Additional costs incurred as a result of this
transaction were approximately $422,000. In addition, certain additional
payments, subject to possible conditions, and contingent payments based on
future earnings may be made. It is expected that EDO will continue the use of
the acquired assets.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September
25, 1993 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of earnings for
the year ended December 31, 1992 and the nine months ended September 25, 1993
give effect to the above acquisition by EDO Corporation.

The pro forma consolidated financial statements assume that the acquisition for
which pro forma effects are shown were completed as of September 25, 1993 for
the pro forma consolidated balance sheet, and as of January 1, 1992 for the pro
forma consolidated statements of earnings. The acquisition has been accounted
for as a purchase.

The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the
actual results of operations that would have occurred had the purchase been
made at the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto included
elsewhere herein and the Registrant's periodic reports filed pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
