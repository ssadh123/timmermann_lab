INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Shareholders of 
COMSAT Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying supplemental consolidated
balance sheets of COMSAT Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related supplemental
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash
flow for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993. The supplemental consolidated financial statements
give retroactive effect to the merger of COMSAT Corporation and
subsidiaries and Radiation Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries on
June 3, 1994, which has been accounted for as a pooling-of-
interests as described in Note 2. These supplemental financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these supplemental financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the supplemental financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
supplemental financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion such supplemental consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1993, after giving retroactive effect to the
merger between COMSAT Corporation and Radiation Systems, Inc. as
described in Note 2, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 12 to the supplemental consolidated
financial statements, in 1991 the corporation changed its method
of accounting for postretirement health and life insurance
benefits to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106. Also, as discussed in Note 13 to the
supplemental consolidated financial statements, in 1993 the
corporation changed its method of accounting for income taxes to
conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109.

COMSAT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies that have guided the
preparation of these financial statements are:

Principles of Consolidation
- ---------------------------
Accounts of COMSAT Corporation and its majority-owned
subsidiaries (the corporation) have been consolidated. 
Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

The corporation has consolidated its share of the accounts of the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization
(INTELSAT), Inmarsat and the MARISAT Joint Venture (MARISAT). 
The corporation's ownership interests in INTELSAT and Inmarsat
are based primarily on the corporation's usage of these systems. 
As of December 31, 1993, the corporation owned 20.9% of INTELSAT,
23.0% of Inmarsat and 86.3% of MARISAT.

The corporation's investments in the Denver Nuggets Limited
Partnership (the Nuggets) and On Command Video Corporation (OCV)
(see Note 6) were accounted for using the equity method until the
third quarter of 1992. Since July 1992, the accounts of these
investments have been consolidated in the accompanying financial
statements. The interest of other shareholders in the net assets
of OCV is shown as Minority Interest in the accompanying balance
sheet. The minority interest share of the net income of OCV,
which is not significant, is included in Other Income (Expense).

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------
Revenue from satellite services is recognized over the period
during which the satellite services are provided. Revenue from
long-term product, system integration and related service
contracts is accounted for using the percentage-of-completion
method. Revenue from other services is recorded as services are
provided.

Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits
- ---------------------------------------
The corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
effective January 1, 1993. This accounting standard requires the
use of the asset and liability approach for financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes.

Page 8
<PAGE>

The provision for income taxes includes taxes currently payable
and those deferred because of differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The
corporation has earned investment tax credits on certain INTELSAT
and Inmarsat satellite costs. These tax credits have been
deferred and are being recognized as reductions to the tax
provision over the estimated service lives of the related assets.

Earnings Per Share
- ------------------
Primary earnings per share are computed using the average number
of shares outstanding during each period, adjusted for
outstanding stock options and restricted stock units. Fully
diluted earnings per share also assume the conversion of the
corporation's convertible debentures, which were redeemed in
March 1992 (see Note 7). The calculation of the weighted average
number of shares outstanding and all per share amounts have been
adjusted for a two-for-one stock split on June 1, 1993 (see Note
10). The weighted average number of shares for each year is:

Primary 47,095 45,875 44,556
Fully Diluted 47,157 47,291 49,254

</TABLE>

Goodwill
- --------
The balance sheet includes goodwill related to the acquisitions
of OCV, the Nuggets and other ventures. Goodwill is amortized
over 15 to 25 years. Accumulated goodwill amortization was
$4,513,000 and $2,698,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

Franchise Rights and Other Assets
- ---------------------------------
Franchise rights were recorded in connection with the
consolidation of the Nuggets in 1992 and are being amortized over
25 years. The amounts shown on the balance sheets are net of
accumulated amortization of $2,955,000 and $990,000 at December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The cash surrender values of life insurance policies (net of
loans) totalling $40,849,000 and $33,350,000 at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively, are included in Other Assets. Other
Income (Expense) on the income statement includes the increases
in the cash surrender values of these policies. Additionally,
the corporation recorded income of $4,131,000 ($3,137,000 net of
tax) from the death benefit proceeds of certain policies in 1993.

Cash Flow Information
- ---------------------
The corporation considers highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents.

Page 9
<PAGE>

New Accounting Pronouncements
- -----------------------------
SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities," was issued in May 1993 and must be adopted by
the corporation in 1994. This statement requires that certain
investments in debt or equity securities be carried on the
balance sheet at fair value. The effect of this statement is not
material to the corporation as of December 31, 1993. 

SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," was issued in November 1992 and must be adopted by the
corporation in 1994. This statement requires that the estimated
cost of benefits provided to former or inactive employees be
accrued over the term of their active service as employees. The
effect of adopting this statement is not material to the
corporation.

Statement Presentation
- ----------------------
The accompanying supplemental financial statements have been
restated for the merger accounted for as a pooling of interests
as discussed in Note 2. These supplemental financial statements
will become the primary historical financial statements of the
corporation upon issuance of financial statements which include
financial results subsequent to the consummation of the merger.

2. MERGER WITH RADIATION SYSTEMS, INC.

Effective June 3, 1994, the corporation consummated its merger
with Radiation Systems, Inc. (RSi), based in Sterling, Virginia. 
RSi designs, manufactures and integrates satellite earth
stations, advanced antennas and other turnkey systems for
telecommunications, radar, air traffic control and military uses.

Each share of RSi s common stock was converted into 0.780 of a
share of the corporation s common stock. A total of 6,147,000
shares of the corporation s common stock were issued for RSi s
common stock. The January 1994 merger agreement stipulated that
each share of RSi's common stock would be exchanged for $18.25 in
the corporation's common stock, based on the average closing
price of the corporation's stock during the 20 trading days
ending five trading days before the closing of the transaction. 
The agreement also provided that in no event would a share of RSi
common stock be exchanged for less than 0.638 or more than 0.780
of a share of the corporation's common stock. The transaction
costs associated with the merger which are expected to be
approximately $5,000,000 (consisting primarily of investment
banking and legal fees) will be reported as a charge to operating
results in the second quarter of 1994.

The merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests. 
Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements have been
retroactively restated for all periods presented to include the
results of operations, balance sheets and cash flows of RSi. 
Prior to the merger, RSi reported on a June 30 fiscal year basis. 
Accordingly, the accompanying 

Page 10
<PAGE>

financial statements include RSi's financial statements restated 
on a calendar year basis. In addition, the accompanying 
financial statements reflect certain adjustments to conform 
the period in which SFAS No. 109 was adopted. There were no 
significant intercompany transactions between the two companies.

In 1993, COMSAT acquired 404,500 shares of RSi common stock for
$5,098,000 and RSi repurchased 80,000 shares of its own common stock 
for $870,000. These shares have been accounted for as treasury stock. 

Operating results of the separate companies for each year are as
follows:

satellites and furniture, fixtures and equipment is 3 to 15
years. The service life for buildings and improvements is 3 to
40 years.

Costs of satellites which are lost at launch or that fail in
orbit are carried, net of any insurance proceeds, in the property
accounts. The remaining net amounts are depreciated over the
estimated service life of a satellite of the same series.

6. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

Denver Nuggets Limited Partnership
- ----------------------------------
In November 1989, the corporation acquired a 62.5% interest in a
limited partnership which acquired the Denver Nuggets, a
franchise of the National Basketball Association. In 1991, the
corporation acquired an additional interest, bringing its
ownership to 65.3% as of December 31, 1991. In 1992, the
corporation acquired the remaining interests in the partnership. 
The total cost of this investment was $71,500,000 including
liabilities assumed of $33,900,000.

The partnership's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses have
been consolidated with the corporation's financial statements
since July 1, 1992. Prior to this date, the corporation was the
majority owner in the partnership, but was not its managing
general partner. Accordingly, the financial results of the
partnership in prior periods were accounted for using the equity
method.

Page 13
<PAGE>

The corporation's shares of the partnership's losses accounted
for under the equity method were $6,603,000 in 1991 and
$2,857,000 for the first six months of 1992. Had the financial
results been consolidated throughout 1992 or 1991, the effect on
the corporation's financial statements would not have been
material.

On Command Video
- ----------------
In 1991, the corporation acquired a 47% interest in On Command
Video Corporation (OCV), a California-based company that
developed and markets a proprietary video entertainment system to
hotels. The corporation purchased additional shares of OCV stock
throughout 1992 and 1993. OCV's financial statements have been
consolidated since the third quarter of 1992, when the
corporation's ownership increased to 50.4%. The corporation's
ownership share was 65.7% at December 31, 1992 and 73.5% at
December 31, 1993. Had the financial results been consolidated
throughout 1992 or 1991, the effect on the corporation's
financial statements would not have been material. The total
cost of the corporation s investment in OCV was $77,282,000 as of
December 31, 1993.

Rock Spring II Limited Partnership
- ----------------------------------
The corporation entered into a limited partnership to build and
lease a new headquarters facility. The corporation holds a 50%
interest in the partnership, primarily as a limited partner. The
managing general partner, a regional real estate investment
company, owns the remaining 50% interest in the partnership. An
affiliate of the managing general partner owns the building site
and has leased this site to the partnership.

The corporation relocated its headquarters operations to the new
building during the second quarter of 1993. The corporation has
entered into a 15-year lease with the partnership for the
building starting April 1993 (see Note 8). 

The partnership borrowed $27,000,000 in the form of a 26-year
mortgage at a fixed interest rate of 9.45% to cover construction
costs. As of December 31, 1993, the corporation has guaranteed
repayment of this loan. The corporation's guarantee will be
reduced to $2,700,000 after satisfaction of certain contractual
requirements which are expected to be completed in 1994. 
Subsequently, the corporation's guarantee will be reduced as the
principal balance is paid down and completely eliminated once the
outstanding loan balance is less than $24,300,000.

7. DEBT

The corporation, as regulated by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), is allowed to undertake long-term borrowings of
up to 45% of its total capital (long-term debt plus equity) and
$200,000,000 in short-term borrowings.

Page 14
<PAGE>

Commercial Paper
- ----------------
The corporation has a $200,000,000 commercial paper program. 
Throughout 1993 and 1992, the corporation issued short-term
commercial paper with repayment terms of 90 days or less. The
corporation had $43,233,000 and $47,795,000 in borrowings
outstanding at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992,
respectively. 

Credit Facilities
- -----------------
The corporation has a $200,000,000 revolving credit agreement
which will expire in December 1998. There have been no
borrowings under this agreement. The corporation had notes
payable outstanding of $4,000,000 at December 31, 1993 under a
separate credit agreement which was terminated in connection with
the merger discussed in Note 2.

Long-Term Debt

========== ==========

</TABLE>

In April 1992, the corporation issued $160,000,000 of 8.125%
debentures due April 1, 2004. The corporation used $110,000,000
of the proceeds to redeem its 7.75% convertible subordinated
debentures in April 1992. The balance of the proceeds was used
to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

In August 1992, INTELSAT issued $200,000,000 of 7.375% Eurobonds. 
Interest is payable annually in August, and the bonds are due
August 6, 2002. The corporation received its share of the
proceeds and recorded long-term debt.

In January 1993, INTELSAT issued $150,000,000 of 6.75% Eurobonds. 
Interest is payable annually in January, and the notes are due
January 19, 2000. 

Page 15
<PAGE>

The corporation received its share of the proceeds and recorded 
long-term debt. The corporation prepaid $30,000,000 of 
its 9.55% notes with the proceeds. The remaining $70,000,000 
balance of the 9.55% notes is due in April 1994 and
has been classified as a current liability on the December 31,
1993 balance sheet. 

The principal amount of debt (excluding the Inmarsat lease
financing obligation) maturing over the next five years is
$73,215,000 in 1994, $3,509,000 in 1995, $2,716,000 in 1996,
$1,120,000 in 1997 and $420,000 in 1998.

Inmarsat Lease Financing Obligations
- ------------------------------------
Inmarsat borrowed 140,400,000 pounds sterling under a capital lease
agreement to finance the construction of second-generation
Inmarsat satellites. Inmarsat also entered into another capital
lease arrangement to finance the construction costs of its third-
generation satellites. As of December 31, 1993, 65,500,000 pounds
sterling of the 197,000,000 pounds sterling available for this purpose
has been borrowed. The corporation's share of these lease
obligations is included in long-term debt. Inmarsat has hedged
its obligations through various foreign exchange transactions to
minimize the effect of fluctuating interest and exchange rates
(see Note 16).

The corporation's share of the payments under these lease
obligations for each of the next five years from 1994 through
1998 is $9,166,000, $11,486,000, $12,490,000, $13,637,000 and
$14,895,000 and $87,451,000 thereafter. These payments include
interest totalling $50,466,000 and a current maturity of
$3,700,000.

ESOP Debt
- ---------
As discussed in Note 12, the corporation has an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP). The ESOP has bank notes payable
outstanding which are guaranteed by the corporation. 
Accordingly, these notes are reported as long-term debt of the
corporation. The ESOP debt includes an 8.75% note with quarterly
principal and interest payments through 1996 and a 10.95% note
with quarterly principal and interest payments through 1997.

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Property and Equipment
- ----------------------
As of December 31, 1993, the corporation had commitments to
acquire property and equipment totalling $379,649,000. Of this
total, $353,371,000 is payable over the next three years. These
commitments are related principally to the purchase of INTELSAT
and Inmarsat satellites.

Employment and Consulting Agreements
- ------------------------------------
The Nuggets have employment and consulting agreements with
certain officers, coaches and players. Virtually all of these
agreements provide for guaranteed payments. Other contracts

Page 16
<PAGE>

provide for payments contingent upon the fulfillment of certain
terms and conditions. Amounts required to be paid under such
agreements total $17,682,000 in 1994, $17,906,000 in 1995,
$18,243,000 in 1996, $14,158,000 in 1997, $10,484,000 in 1998 and
$4,536,000 thereafter.

Leases
- ------
As discussed in Note 6, the corporation has a 15-year lease which
started April 1993 on its new headquarters building in Bethesda,
Maryland, and the corporation has a ten-year lease ending in 1996
on its former headquarters building in Washington, D.C. The
corporation also has leases of other property and equipment. 
Annual rent expense was $7,993,000 in 1993, $4,253,000 in 1992
and $3,692,000 in 1991. These amounts are net of the $3,921,000
annual amortization of the deferred gain from the sale and
leaseback of the Washington, D.C. building in 1986. Annual
rental income from noncancelable subleases totals approximately
$3,800,000.

The corporation's payments under all operating leases for 1994
through 1998 are $13,901,000, $13,230,000, $12,376,000,
$5,527,000, $5,595,000 and thereafter, $45,697,000.

Government Contracts
- --------------------
The corporation is subject to routine audit and investigation by
various agencies which oversee contract performance in connection
with the corporation s contracts with the U.S. Government. 
Management believes that potential claims from such
investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Issue
- -------------------
The corporation is engaged in a program to monitor a toxic
solvent spill of limited scope that occurred in 1986 at the site
of its former manufacturing subsidiary in California. The
corporation believes that it has complied with remediation
requirements. Management believes that the corporation has
sufficient accruals to cover the monitoring costs.

9. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND LITIGATION

Regulatory Environment
- ----------------------
Under the Communications Act of 1934 and the Satellite Act, the
corporation is subject to regulation by the FCC with respect to
communications services provided through the INTELSAT and
Inmarsat systems and the rates charged for those services.

In 1993, the FCC initiated an audit of the corporation's role as
the United States signatory to Inmarsat and as a provider of
international mobile satellite services. In the opinion of
management, the ultimate outcome of the audit will not have a
material effect on the accompanying financial statements. 

Page 17
<PAGE>

Until 1985, the corporation was, with minor exceptions, the sole
United States provider of international satellite communications
services using the INTELSAT system. Since then, the FCC has
authorized several international satellite systems separate from
INTELSAT. These U.S. separate systems currently compete against
the corporation for voice, video and data traffic. In 1993, the
FCC substantially eliminated prior restrictions on the ability of
separate systems to offer public switched telephony services,
thereby potentially increasing competition to the corporation in
the voice market. The United States government has established a
goal to eliminate all restrictions on competitive systems by
1997.

Litigation
- ----------
In 1989, Pan American Satellite (PanAmSat) filed an antitrust
suit against the corporation alleging interference with
PanAmSat's efforts to compete in the international satellite
communications market and seeking trebled damages of
approximately $1.5 billion. In 1991, a United States Court of
Appeals ruled that the corporation is immune from antitrust suits
in its role as a signatory to INTELSAT. In February 1992, the
United States Supreme Court denied PanAmSat's request for a
review of the lower court's decision. An amended complaint was
filed alleging that the corporation violated antitrust laws in
its business activities purportedly outside of its role as a
signatory to INTELSAT. In March 1993, a Federal district court
denied the corporation's motion to dismiss the amended complaint
and allowed PanAmSat to proceed with discovery. In February 1994,
PanAmSat submitted a report estimating its alleged damages
(before trebling) at a 1994 present value of $227,436,000. Also
in February 1994, PanAmSat filed a motion with the district court
for acceptance of a third amended and supplemental complaint that
would add several new claims and 15 new defendants to the suit,
primarily as alleged co-conspirators with the corporation. In
June 1994, the court denied PanAmSat s motion and ruled that
discovery is to be completed in September 1994. In the opinion
of management, the complaint against the corporation is without
merit, and the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have
a material effect on the corporation's financial statements. 

The corporation is defending an intellectual property
infringement suit brought by Spectradyne, Inc. against its COMSAT
Video Enterprises, Inc. and On Command Video Corporation
subsidiaries. The initial patent claims were dismissed. 
However, Spectradyne amended its complaint to substitute new
patent infringement claims along with claims that the
corporation's subsidiaries induced unnamed third parties to
infringe a copyrighted software interface. Subsequently,
Spectradyne further amended its complaint by substituting direct
copyright infringement claims for the inducement to infringe
claims. Spectradyne is seeking damages in an unspecified amount
and injunctive relief. The corporation believes that these
claims are without merit and that the ultimate disposition of
this matter will not have a material effect on the corporation's
financial statements.

In February 1994, two shareholder class action lawsuits were
filed in Nevada state court challenging the proposed merger
between RSi and the corporation. In May 1994, the suits were

Page 18
<PAGE>

consolidated. The defendants in the suit are RSi, its directors
and the corporation. The suit alleges, among other things, that
the proposed merger consideration was unfair and inadequate. The
suit seeks, among other things, to recover damages resulting from
the consummation of the merger. All of the defendants have filed
motions to dismiss which are pending before the court. 
Management believes that the lawsuit is without merit and that
the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material
effect on the corporation s financial statements.

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Effective June 1, 1993, the corporation's Articles of
Incorporation were amended to increase the number of authorized
shares of the corporation's common stock from 40,000,000 shares
to 100,000,000 shares and to split each share of common stock
outstanding on June 1, 1993 into two shares of common stock. 
Earnings per share and share amounts for all prior periods have
been restated to reflect this stock split. The corporation's
Articles of Incorporation were also amended to increase the
number of authorized shares of the corporation's preferred stock
from 1,000 shares to 5,000,000 shares and to permit preferred
stock to be convertible into any other class of stock. No
preferred stock is currently outstanding.

11. INCENTIVE STOCK PLANS

The corporation has stock plans for officers, directors and
employees. These plans provide for the issuance of restricted
stock awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units
and stock options. Under the current plans, grants for up to
5,550,000 shares may be made. As of December 31, 1993, 5,589,000
shares of the corporation's authorized common stock were reserved
for these plans. As of December 31, 1993, no stock appreciation
rights were outstanding.

Restricted Stock Awards
- -----------------------
Restricted stock awards are shares of stock that are subject to
restrictions on their sale or transfer. These restrictions are
lifted over six years. During 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively,
348,000, 68,000 and 134,000 restricted stock awards were granted,
net of awards forfeited.

Restricted Stock Units
- ----------------------
Restricted stock units entitle the holder to receive a
combination of stock and cash equal to the market price of common
stock for each unit, when vested. These units vest over three
years. During 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, 49,000, 42,000
and 56,000 restricted stock units were granted. At December 31,
1993, 124,000 partially vested restricted stock units were
outstanding.

Page 19
<PAGE>

Stock Options
- -------------
Under the current plans, the exercise price for stock options may
not be less than 50% of the fair market value of the stock when
granted. Options vest over three years and expire after 15
years. Stock option activity was as follows:

</TABLE>

The corporation is recognizing an expense over three years equal
to the exercise price of certain 1991 and 1992 options, since
they were granted at 50% of the market price. The exercise price
for options awarded in 1993 is equal to the fair market value on
the grant date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
- ----------------------------
Employees may purchase stock at a discount through the
corporation's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The purchase price
of the shares is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the
stock on the offering date, or 85% of the fair market value of
the stock on the last business day of each month throughout the
following year. The offering date for 1994 purchases was
November 19, 1993, when 85% of the fair market value was $25.87.

A total of 2,426,000 shares of the corporation's unissued common
stock has been reserved for this plan.

12. PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

The corporation has a non-contributory, defined benefit pension
plan which covers substantially all of its employees except those
who were employees of RSi immediately prior to the merger. 
Pension benefits are based on years of service and compensation
prior to retirement. The corporation's funding policy is to make
the contributions when required by law.

Page 20
<PAGE>

The net pension expense for each year includes the following
components:

In September 1992, the corporation offered an early retirement
program to certain employees in connection with its restructuring
of certain operations (see Note 14). This program provided
enhanced retirement benefits and an option for a lump sum payment
of all benefits. The additional pension expense for this program

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
- --------------------------------------
The corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension plan for
executives. The expense for this plan was $2,058,000, $1,917,000
and $4,243,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

As of December 31, 1993, the corporation recorded an additional
minimum liability of $5,740,000 for this plan. This amount is
the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the
previously recorded plan liability. The corporation also
recorded an intangible asset of $2,128,000 which represents the
unrecognized transition obligation and a charge to stockholders 
equity of $2,301,000, net of tax. 

The corporation's accrued liabilities for this plan were
$15,679,000 and $10,661,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. As of December 31, 1993, the accumulated benefit
obligation was approximately $15,679,000, and the projected
benefit obligation was approximately $16,449,000, assuming a
discount rate of 7% and future salary increases of 5%.

401(k) Plan
- -----------
The corporation has a 401(k) plan for qualifying employees. A
portion of employee contributions is matched by the corporation. 
The corporation's matching contributions for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 were $3,237,000, $2,860,000 and
$2,585,000, respectively.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan
- -----------------------------
The corporation has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) which
was established in 1988 by RSi for the benefit of eligible
employees. The ESOP has acquired 714,000 shares of common stock
with bank loan proceeds. The corporation makes periodic
contributions to the ESOP at least sufficient to make principal
and interest payments as they are due. Contributions to the ESOP
charged to expense totaled $1,049,000 in 1993, $1,026,000 in
1992, and $958,000 in 1991.

The corporation has guaranteed the ESOP s bank notes payable and
has reported the unpaid balance of these loans as a liability of
the corporation (see Note 7). An unearned ESOP compensation
amount, which is equal to the unpaid bank loans, has been
reported as a reduction of stockholder's equity.

Postretirement Benefits
- -----------------------
The corporation provides health and life insurance benefits to
retirees except those who retire from RSi. Effective January 1,
1991, the corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 106,
which requires that the expected cost of these benefits be
recognized during the years in which employees render service. 
Prior to 1991, the cost of such benefits was expensed as paid by
the corporation. The corporation recognized the full obligation
attributable to the cost of prior years' service in 1991. The

Page 22
<PAGE>

cumulative effect to January 1, 1991 was $40,314,000, less taxes
of $13,707,000, and is shown separately in the 1991 income
statement. 

The net postretirement benefit expense for each year included the
following components:

</TABLE>

In 1993, the corporation made several modifications to its
postretirement benefits program including higher participant
premium payments, higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums
and reduced benefits for certain participants. Additionally, the
corporation implemented a managed health care program to better
control costs. These changes, which are effective January 1,
1994, resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation and an unrecognized gain of $12,873,000 as of
December 31, 1993.

An 11% increase in health care costs was assumed for 1993 with
the rate decreasing 0.5% each year to an ultimate rate of 6%. 
Increasing the assumed trend rate by 1% each year would have
increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1993 by $6,115,000 and the benefit expense for 1993
by $900,000.

13. INCOME TAXES 

The corporation adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," effective January 1, 1993. This accounting statement
changed the method for the recognition and measurement of
deferred tax assets and liabilities. The cumulative effect of
adopting SFAS No. 109 on the corporation's financial statements
was to increase income by $1,925,000 ($0.04 per share) and was
recorded in the first quarter of 1993. Prior year financial
statements have not been restated.

The components of income tax expense for each year are:

SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be
adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates. 
Accordingly, the corporation recorded a charge to income tax
expense of $2,977,000 in the third quarter of 1993 to adjust
prior years' deferred tax assets and liabilities for an increase
in the Federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently examining Federal
income tax returns for 1990 and 1991 and has completed
examinations of the Federal income tax returns of the corporation
through 1989. The corporation has also amended its returns and
filed claims for refunds for 1979 through 1987. The IRS has
denied these claims. The corporation is contesting this denial
by the IRS and other adjustments proposed by the IRS on the 1980
through 1987 income tax returns. In the opinion of the
corporation, adequate provision has been made for income taxes
for all periods through 1993.

14. PROVISION FOR RESTRUCTURING

In September 1992, the corporation recorded a $38,961,000 charge
for restructuring costs. At that time, the corporation announced
its plans to realign business activities, downsize certain
functions, and reposition COMSAT Video Enterprises, Inc. (CVE) to
capitalize on the growing market for on-demand entertainment. 
The restructuring costs relate to headcount reductions throughout
the corporation and the elimination of the former COMSAT Systems
Division and the consolidation of its operations with those of
COMSAT Laboratories into a new division, COMSAT Technology
Services, as well as the transfer of television distribution

Page 25
<PAGE>

services from COMSAT Systems Division to CVE. This charge
consists of $12,644,000 for early retirement and reduction in
force costs related to the reorganization, and $26,317,000 for
equipment, property and other items.

15. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The corporation reports operating results and financial data in
four business segments: International Communications, Mobile
Communications, Video Enterprises and Technology Services. The
International Communications segment consists of activities
undertaken by the corporation in its COMSAT World Systems
business, including INTELSAT services. This segment also
includes the activities of the corporation's international
ventures, which are accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Mobile Communications segment consists of activities
undertaken by the corporation in its COMSAT Mobile Communications
(CMC) business, including Inmarsat services. The Video
Enterprises segment includes entertainment services provided to
the hospitality industry as well as video distribution services
to television networks. The Technology Services segment includes
the design and manufacture of voice and data communications
networks and products, systems integration services, and applied
research and technology services and includes the operations of
RSi (see Note 2). The financial results of the Denver Nuggets
Limited Partnership are included in Other Corporate activities.

The corporation has redefined its reporting segments. Prior to
1993, CMC was included in the International Communications
segment. In the first quarter of 1993, the operations of the
corporation's earth stations in Connecticut and California were
transferred from the Technology Services segment to the Mobile
Communications segment. As discussed in Note 14, business
activities within the Technology Services and Video Enterprises
segments were realigned in 1992. The financial results presented
below for prior periods have been restated consistent with these
changes. Additionally, segment information for all periods has
been restated for the merger with RSi as discussed in Note 2. 
RSi s results are included in the Technology Services segment. 
Operating Income (Loss) for each segment has been further
restated to reallocate indirect expenses.

16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET RISKS

SFAS No. 107, which became effective in 1992, requires
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments. 
In these disclosures, fair values are estimates and do not
necessarily represent the amounts that would be received or
paid in an actual sale or settlement of the financial
instruments.

At December 31, 1993, the corporation was contingently
liable to banks for $11,813,000 for outstanding letters of
credit securing performance of certain contracts. As
discussed in Note 6, the corporation has guaranteed
repayment of the construction loan related to its
headquarters building. The corporation has other financial
guarantees totalling approximately $3,000,000 as of December
31, 1993. The estimated fair value of these instruments is
not significant.

Inmarsat has entered into foreign currency contracts
designed to minimize exposure to exchange rate fluctuations
on foreign currency transactions. At December 31, 1993,
Inmarsat had several contracts maturing in 1994 to purchase
12,500,000 pounds sterling for a total of $18,392,000. The
corporation's share of the estimated fair value of these
contracts, as determined by a bank, is an unrealized gain of
approximately $13,000 at December 31, 1993.

Inmarsat has entered into interest rate and foreign currency
swap arrangements to minimize the exposure to interest rate
and foreign currency exchange fluctuations related to its
satellite financing obligations. Inmarsat borrowed and is
obligated to repay pounds sterling. The pounds sterling
borrowed were swapped for U.S. dollars with an agreement to
exchange the dollars for pounds sterling in order to meet
the future lease payments. Inmarsat pays interest on the
dollars at an average fixed rate of 9.0% and it receives
variable interest on the sterling amounts based on short-
term LIBOR rates. The differential to be paid or received
is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized over
the life of the agreements. The currency swap arrangements
have been designated as hedges and any gains or losses are
included in the measurement of the debt. The effect of
these swaps is to change the sterling lease obligation into
fixed interest rate dollar debt. As of December 31, 1993,

Page 28
<PAGE>

Inmarsat had $352,327,000 of swaps to be exchanged for
211,400,000 pounds sterling at various dates through 2005. 
Inmarsat is exposed to loss if one or more of the
counterparties defaults. However, Inmarsat does not
anticipate non-performance by the counterparties as they are
major financial institutions. The corporation s share of
the estimated fair value of these swaps is an unrealized
loss of $18,500,000 at December 31, 1993. The fair value
was estimated by computing the present value of the dollar
obligations using current rates available for issuance of
debt with similar terms, and the current value of the
sterling at year-end exchange rates.

The fair value of long-term debt (excluding capitalized
leases) was estimated by computing present values of the
related cash flows using risk adjustments to Treasury rates
obtained from investment bankers.

17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Debt
- ---- 
In March 1994, INTELSAT issued $200,000,000 of 6.625% notes
due March 22, 2004. Interest is payable annually in
arrears. The corporation has recorded its $40,400,000 share
of the long-term debt.

In April 1994, the corporation used commercial paper
borrowings to pay the $70,000,000 balance of its 9.55%
notes. This amount was classified as a current liability on
the December 31, 1993 balance sheet.

INTELSAT and Inmarsat Share Changes
- ----------------------------------- 
The corporation decreased its ownership share of INTELSAT
during the first quarter of 1994 from 20.9% at December 31,
1993 to 20.2% as of March 31, 1994. This resulted in
decreases in assets of $15,500,000 and liabilities of
$3,400,000.

The corporation also decreased its ownership share of
Inmarsat during the first quarter of 1994 from 23.0% at
December 31, 1993 to 22.4% as of March 31, 1994. The

Page 29
<PAGE>

corporation recorded decreases in assets and liabilities of
$6,000,000 and $3,000,000, respectively.

Equity Investment
- ----------------- 
The corporation has an agreement in principle to acquire a
minority interest in Philippine Global Communications, Inc.,
a provider of international communications services in the
Philippines, for $42,000,000. The transaction is expected
to be consummated in 1994.
