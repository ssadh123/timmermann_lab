Fleet Financial Group Reports

Record Third Quarter Earnings of $164 Million

Providence, R. I., October 19, 1994: Fleet Financial Group 
today reported record net income of $164 million, or $1.01 per 
fully diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 1994, 
up 29% from the $127 million, or $.78 per fully diluted share, 
earned in the third quarter of 1993.

For the first nine months of 1994, net income was $448 
million, or $2.70 per fully diluted share, up 27% from the $352 
million, or $2.16 per fully diluted share, for the first nine 
months of 1993.

"We are delighted to report another quarter of strong 
operating results which reflect favorable loan growth trends in 
the Northeast, ongoing expense control efforts, continued 
improvement in credit quality, and significant expansion of our 
banking and financial services franchises," said Terrence 
Murray, chairman and chief executive officer.

"We are especially pleased that our return on assets and 
return on equity continue to show improvement over the already 
high levels reported in previous quarters." Eugene M. McQuade, 
executive vice president and chief financial officer, noted: 
"Return on assets for the quarter was 1.30% and return on 
equity was 20.08%, compared to 1.09% and 16.37%, respectively, 
for the third quarter of 1993 and 1.22% and 18.31% for the 
second quarter of 1994."

"Growth in both commercial and consumer loans continues to 
be encouraging," Murray noted, "as average loans and leases 
increased 10% on an annualized basis compared to the previous 
quarter. In addition, during the quarter we strengthened our 
banking and financial services franchises through acquisitions 
and mortgage servicing purchases. We completed the acquisition 
of Sterling Bancshares, signed a definitive agreement to 
acquire Plaza Home Mortgage Corp., and Fleet Mortgage Group, 
our mortgage banking subsidiary, purchased nearly $10 billion 
in mortgage servicing."

Income Statement

Net interest income of $505 million decreased slightly from 
the $512 million recorded in the previous quarter as a result 
of the impact of rising short-term interest rates on the 
Corporation's investment portfolio. Net interest margin for 
the third quarter was 4.45% compared to 4.66% in the second 
quarter. The effect of the narrower margin on net interest 
income, also the result of rising interest rates, was 
substantially offset by growth in earning assets.

The third quarter provision for credit losses was $11 
million. As a further sign that the economy is strengthening in 
the Northeast, net charge-offs for the quarter amounted to only 
$19 million, compared to $71 million in 1993. These positive 
items reflect a 29% decrease in nonperforming assets (NPAs) 
over the past year to $526 million at September 30.

Noninterest income for the third quarter was $288 million 
compared to $318 million, excluding $127 million of securities 
gains, in the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to a 
reduction in mortgage banking income as a result of a 
continuing decline in mortgage production revenue caused by the 
refinancing wave in mortgage lending during 1993.

Noninterest expense totaled $501 million in the third 
quarter compared to $562 million for the third quarter of 1993, 
prior to a $125 million restructuring charge in 1993. This $61 
million decrease is primarily attributable to reductions 
resulting from the Corporation's efficiency improvement program 
and a reduction in mortgage servicing amortization resulting 
from a significant decline in mortgage refinancings. Included 
in noninterest expense is the previously announced $7 million 
restructuring charge recorded at Fleet Mortgage Group.

Earnings by Group

The Banking Group generated $162 million (excluding $1 
million of after-tax securities losses) in third quarter 
earnings, compared to $109 million (excluding $58 million of 
after-tax securities gains) in 1993's third quarter. These 
improved results were due to reduced credit costs, as asset 
quality continues to improve, and expense reductions from our 
efficiency improvement programs.

The Financial Services Group recorded income of $18 million 
in the third quarter, compared to $37 million in 1993's third 
quarter. Fleet Mortgage contributed $17 million, excluding the 
restructuring charge, to Fleet's earnings for the quarter 
compared to $20 million in the third quarter of 1993. This 
decrease is primarily due to reduced mortgage production 
revenue, as mortgage loan origination is significantly below 
the levels of a year ago.

During the third quarter, in further recognition of the 
changing mortgage lending environment, the Corporation made 
several strategic moves at its mortgage banking subsidiary, 
including: the signing of an agreement to acquire Plaza Home 
Mortgage Corp. and its $9 billion servicing portfolio; the 
purchase of an additional $10 billion in mortgage servicing; 
and the completion of the previously announced reengineering 
program that identified $40 million in annual pre-tax profit 
improvements when compared to that subsidiary's second quarter 
revenue and expense.

Fleet Finance recorded a loss of $8 million in the quarter 
compared to a breakeven position for the same period in 1993. 
The loss is attributable to lower net interest income as a 
result of lower outstandings and increased provision for credit 
losses due to asset quality concerns at that subsidiary.

Balance Sheet

Total assets at September 30, 1994 were $47.0 billion, 
while total loans and leases were $27.0 billion at the same 
date, compared with $46.9 billion of total assets and $26.3 
billion of total loans and leases at September 30, 1993. 
Average loans and leases increased more than $600 million from 
the second quarter primarily in commercial and consumer loans, 
as average loan growth was noted in all Fleet banking markets, 
especially the Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island 
franchises.

The reserve for credit losses was $969 million at September 
30, 1994, representing 3.58% of loans, compared to $977 
million, or 3.65% of loans, at June 30, 1994.

Stockholders' equity amounted to $3.4 billion at September 
30, 1994 compared to $3.6 billion at June 30, 1994. The 
decrease reflects the previously announced repurchase of common 
shares in anticipation of the purchase of New Bedford Bancorp.

All 1994 financial information has been restated to include 
the acquisition of Sterling Bancshares as if it had occurred on 
January 1, 1994.

Fleet Financial Group is a diversified financial services 
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE-FLT) with 
approximately 1,200 offices nationwide. Its lines of business 
include commercial and consumer banking, mortgage banking, 
investment management, and student loan processing.
