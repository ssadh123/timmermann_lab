Item 5. Other Events

On July 25, 1994, American Express Company issued the following
press release:

NEW YORK, July 25, 1994 - American Express Company today reported 
second quarter income from continuing operations of $359 million, or $0.70 per
share, compared with $301 million, or $0.60 per share, a year ago. The
Company completed the spin-off of Lehman Brothers (Lehman) on May 31, 1994.
Including Lehman as a discontinued operation through the spin-off date,
American Express' net income totaled $357 million, or $0.69 per share,
compared with $416 million, or $0.83 per share a year ago.

Travel Related Services (TRS) reported record second quarter net income
of $263 million, a 13 percent increase over last year's net income of $233
million. 

Net revenues increased 7 percent reflecting an increase in worldwide
billed business and growth in Business Travel sales. The increase in billed
business resulted from higher spending per Cardmember and an increase in the
number of Cards outstanding. The increase in net revenues was partially
offset by discount rate reductions. 

The provision for losses declined, reflecting improved credit quality. 
Excluding the provision and interest, total expenses increased 9 percent, in
part reflecting Business Travel growth and investments in certain business
initiatives.

IDS Financial Services (IDS) reported record second quarter net income of
$109 million, a 21 percent increase over last year's net income of $90
million.

Revenue and earnings growth benefited primarily from an increase in 
management fees and net investment income that resulted from higher asset
levels. Results also benefited from wider investment margins compared to
year-ago levels.

IDS reported increased sales of annuities, mutual funds and investment
certificates, while sales of life and related insurance products decreased
slightly from last year.
<PAGE>
American Express Bank (AEB) reported second quarter net income of $19
million, compared with last year's net income of $21 million. 

Results for the second quarter reflect a decline in net interest income,
primarily due to higher short-term funding costs and lower investment income,
as well as higher operating expenses. Partially offsetting this decline was a
lower provision for credit losses and a lower effective tax rate. Increased
expenses primarily reflected spending related to systems technology.

Total nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets of $93 million
reflect a decrease of $39 million from December 31, 1993 due to the sale of a
foreclosed property and write-offs.

Corporate and Other reported second quarter net expenses of $32 million,
compared with net expenses of $43 million last year.
