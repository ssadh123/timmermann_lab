The firm of Carmichael, Enoch & Associates serves First

the name of the accounting firm will change to Carmichael & 
Associates due to one of the partners' (Enoch) decision to
form a separate firm. The change has no affect to either

partner in charge of Bank Audits will remain as principal 
owner of the firm and will continue to serve as principal 
auditor for Bancshares, and First Citizens. CPA Carmichael 
has served as principal auditor for First Citizens National 
Bank and First Citizens Bancshares, Inc. since 1981 and 
1986 respectively.
