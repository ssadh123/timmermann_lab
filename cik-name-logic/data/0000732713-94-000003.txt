Item 5. Other Events

On February 1, 1994, BellSouth Corporation ("BellSouth") announced it will
invest an additional $500 million in QVC Network, Inc. ("QVC") equity
securities, bringing to $2 billion the total it has committed to QVC contingent
on successful completion of its proposed merger with Paramount Communications,
Inc. ("Paramount").

The additional investment will help QVC to strengthen its bid for Paramount,
raising the cash portion of its bid to $104.00 per share.

Under the new agreement, BellSouth, which had earlier agreed to purchase $1.5
billion in QVC common and convertible preferred stock, committed to the
additional purchase of $500 million in QVC common stock.

The agreement announced on February 1, 1994 also revises the share prices that
were outlined in the initial purchase agreement. Under the revised terms,
BellSouth has committed to purchase $1 billion in QVC common stock at $52.00 per
share and the additional $500 million in QVC common stock at $42 per share.
BellSouth will also purchase $500 million of QVC 6% convertible exchangeable
preferred stock, convertible into QVC common stock at $55.00 per share.

The purchases, which remain contingent on QVC successfully completing its
proposed merger with Paramount, would make BellSouth QVC's largest shareholder.
