Summary: Rochester Tel Shareowners Approve Corporate Restructuring
Earnings Cap Lifted; Rochester, NY Market Open to 
Competition on January 1; Directors increase dividend by 
2.5 percent

New York, New York -- December 19, 1994 -- The shareowners of Rochester 
Telephone Corporation (NYSE: RTC) have approved the company's Corporate 
Restructuring and Open Market Plan, effective January 1, 1995. As a 
result of actions taken today, the Rochester, New York market will be 
opened to competition for local telephone service. In addition, the 
company will form an unregulated holding company to be named Frontier 
Corporation. 

Also today, the Rochester Tel Board of Directors increased the 
regular quarterly dividend on common stock for the 35th consecutive 
year. The new quarterly dividend will be 20.75 cents per share, an 
increase of 2.5 percent. The next dividend will be payable February 1, 
1995, to shareowners of record on January 13, 1995.

"This is a landmark day for the industry and for the customers of 
Rochester Tel," said Ron Bittner, the company's president and chief 
executive officer. "We thank our investors for their confidence and 
look forward to a period of unprecedented opportunity for all of our

stakeholders." Bittner added that the company's new name reflects its 
nationwide scope as well as the company's legacy of innovation and 
leadership.

All five proposals related to the plan were approved by 
shareowners of common stock at a meeting held this morning at the 
Pierre Hotel in New York City. The proposals included: 

-- The Open Market Plan/Holding Company proposal;

-- A Common Stock Amendment to increase the number of authorized 
shares of common stock from 100 million to 300 million shares;

-- A Preferred Stock Amendment to authorize 4 million shares of a 
new class of preferred stock which would be designated as Class A 
Preferred Stock; 

-- A Redemption Provision Amendment to permit the redemption of 
shares of the company's common stock to the extent necessary to prevent 
the loss of any license or franchise from any governmental entity held 
by the company or any of its subsidiaries; and 

-- The Name Change Amendment to change the name of the company to 
Frontier Corporation.

Under terms of the Open Market Plan, the company will receive 
unprecedented regulatory relief. The operating telephone company in 
Rochester, New York will no longer be regulated by the monopoly 
standard of rate-of-return regulation, but instead by pure price 
regulation. The local market for telephone service in Rochester will 
be opened up to full competition, and consumer prices in Rochester will

be reduced and frozen for seven years. The company's telephone 
operations in Rochester will be divided into a competitive company -- 
Frontier Communications of Rochester -- and a network company, to be 
called Rochester Telephone. 

The Open Market Plan was first filed by the company in February of 
1993 and approved by the New York State Public Service Commission on 
October 13, 1994.

Under the Frontier identity system, RCI Long Distance will be 
renamed Frontier Communications International. Two other long distance 
entities, Long Distance North and Mid Atlantic Telecom, will be renamed 
Frontier Communications of New England and Frontier Communications of 
the Mid Atlantic, respectively. The telephone properties outside of 
Rochester will each have a distinctive name related to Frontier 
Communications.

After January 1, 1995, the company's new symbol on the New York 
Stock Exchange will be FRO. The transition of signage, vehicles and 
stationery will take place throughout 1995.

Rochester Telephone Corporation is a provider of integrated 
telecommunications solutions to more than 1.5 million customers in the 
Northeast, South and Midwest through its long distance, local telephone 
and wireless communications operations. The pending acquisition of two 
long distance companies will give the company a nationwide reach in 
1995.
