ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on October 14, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc.
("Ames" or the "Company") will distribute to its banks and other
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of its
unaudited financial results for the five and thirty-five weeks
ended October 1, 1994. These monthly and year-to-date results
(collectively, the "monthly results") are attached hereto as
Exhibit 20 and are incorporated by reference herein.

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated May
27, 1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the five
weeks ended October 1, 1994 were $9.4 million less than Plan and
EBITDA (as defined in Exhibit 20) was $4.4 million less than Plan
and $0.3 million greater than last year. In September, the
unfavorable sales variance was primarily due to shortfalls in
ladies and childrens apparel, most home products, and convenience
goods. September's gross margin rate was also less than Plan due
primarily to higher-than-planned markdowns in apparel and
convenience goods. Expenses were slightly above Plan due
primarily to lower-than-planned other income (which is netted
against expenses in the management format) because of lower
purchase discounts resulting from better-than-planned trade
payable terms. Store non-payroll, field and home office expenses
were less than Plan in September.

Sales for the thirty-five weeks ended October 1, 1994 were $27.9
million less than Plan and EBITDA was $5.1 million less than Plan
but $11.3 million greater than last year. The year-to-date
unfavorable sales variance was due primarily to shortfalls in
ladies apparel, crafts, and convenience goods. The lower
year-to-date gross margin rate was due to higher-than-planned
markdowns, particularly in apparel. The unfavorable impact on the
year-to-date EBITDA from the lower-than-planned sales and gross
margin rate was partially offset by lower-than-planned expenses
and additional gains on property sales. Year-to-date store, field
and home office expenses were all less than Plan.

As of October 1, 1994, LIFO inventories were $33.0 million greater
than Plan, primarily in hardline categories. As previously
reported, the Company decided to temporarily build inventory
levels above those projected in the Plan to support several new
sales promotions for the Fall and Christmas seasons. Trade
payables were $22.7 million greater than Plan due primarily to the
higher-than-planned inventory purchases and improved payment
terms. Outstanding borrowings under the Company's revolving line
of credit as of October 1, 1994 were $13.2 million greater than
Plan due primarily to the additional inventory purchases,
partially offset by the better-than-planned trade payable terms.

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks and other
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their
credit analyses. The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON
FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994,
the Company's Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarters
ended April 30 and July 30, 1994, respectively, and the Company's
Form 8-K dated May 27, 1994. The monthly results are being
reported publicly solely because they are being distributed to a
large number of the Company's vendors for purposes of their credit
analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to report publicly its
monthly results during the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. 
Although Ames expects to continue to make its monthly results
public for the fiscal year ending January 28, 1995, Ames does not
believe it is obligated to provide such information indefinitely,
other than as required by applicable regulations, and Ames may
cease making such disclosures and updates at any time. The
monthly results were not examined, reviewed or compiled by Ames'
independent certified public accountants. Moreover, Ames does not
believe that it is obligated to update the monthly results to
reflect subsequent events or developments. The reported monthly
results are subject to future adjustments, if any, that could
materially affect such results. However, in the opinion of the
Company, the monthly results contain all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the periods presented.
