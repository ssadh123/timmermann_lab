HILLHAVEN TO ACQUIRE CPS PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, INC. AND
ADVANCED INFUSION SYSTEMS, INC.; EXPANDS CALIFORNIA PRESENCE AND
ENHANCES SUBACUTE SERVICES

TACOMA, Washington (October 12, 1994) -- The Hillhaven
Corporation (NYSE:HIL) today announced that it has signed a
definitive agreement to acquire closely-held, Mountain View,
California-based CPS Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (CPS) and
Advanced Infusion Systems, Inc. (AIS). The purchase price will
be approximately $29 million consisting of approximately 1.3
million shares of Hillhaven common stock, subject to certain
adjustments, and will be structured as a pooling of interests.
The transaction will be neutral to the current year's earnings
per share and should be additive to future periods. The closing
of the transaction will be October 31, 1994.

CPS and AIS provide a broad array of diversified pharmaceutical
and infusion services through locations in Northern California. 
The combined entities will become part of Hillhaven's subsidiary,
Medisave Pharmacies, the nation's third largest provider of
pharmacy services for long term and subacute care facilities. 
Revenues from CPS and AIS are approximately $25 million
(annualized) and AIS manages another $13 million in revenues
through affiliated companies.

CPS currently provides pharmacy products and related consulting
services to approximately 8,500 residents in over 100 nursing
homes and subacute care facilities. 

AIS is a leading provider of comprehensive infusion therapy
services to residents of nursing centers and subacute care
facilities, and to patients in home settings and ambulatory care
centers. AIS's infusion therapy business serves an average of
over 500 residents per month in 90 nursing centers and subacute
care facilities, and an additional 500 patients in home settings,
as well as in ambulatory care centers.

"The acquisition of CPS and AIS plays a key part in our strategy
of increasing our operating concentrations in areas where we have
significant regional market positions," commented Bruce L. Busby,
Hillhaven's Chairman and CEO. "This acquisition will add to and
complement not only our 42 nursing centers in California which
provide both long term and subacute care but also our 10 existing
statewide pharmacy outlets. We expect to achieve significant
operating efficiencies and economies of scale through growing CPS
and AIS within Hillhaven's network of 344 nursing centers and
pharmacies and with independent third parties."

Busby continued, "CPS and AIS will further enhance Hillhaven's
growth as a subacute care provider by focusing on the higher
acuity infusion patients. AIS's home and ambulatory infusion
programs will expand our drug delivery system outside of the
traditional nursing center environment."

Willis D. Corkern, Chairman and CEO of AIS said, "We are very
excited about our new association with Hillhaven and Medisave
Pharmacies. Their significant presence in California will allow
our organizations a unique opportunity to capitalize on each of
our strengths. Driven by the demand for health care cost
containment, this consolidation will allow us to provide the
highest quality institutional pharmacy and infusion services in a
more cost effective manner. This will further enhance our
ability to contract with managed care payors."

The Hillhaven Corporation is one of the nation's largest
diversified health care providers, operating 307 nursing centers
and retirement housing communities and, through its Medisave
Pharmacies subsidiary, 56 pharmacies, in a total of 36 states.
