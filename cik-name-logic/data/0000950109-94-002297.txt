Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. 

Item 2 of the Form 8-K of Shared Medical Systems Corporation ("The Company")
dated September 30, 1994 is hereby amended in its entirety as follows:

On September 30, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of GTE Health Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("GTEHS"), from its
sole stockholder, GTE Directories Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("GTE
Directories"), for an aggregate consideration of approximately $17,000,000.
Immediately preceding the aforementioned transaction, GTEHS transferred the
business of its MedSeries Open and MedSeries Enterprise software product lines
and their related assets and liabilities to an affiliate of GTE Corporation.
Therefore, GTEHS' MedSeries4 software product line was the only remaining
business held by GTEHS upon its acquisition by the Company. This transaction has
been accounted for as a purchase. The total consideration as provided in the
Stock Purchase Agreement was the result of negotiations between the Company and
GTE Directories. 

The funds used by the Company to complete the acquisition were provided by the
Company's working capital, supplemented by borrowings from its line of credit
with PNC Bank, N.A.

GTEHS has been a provider of hospital information systems to the healthcare
industry. Upon its acquisition by the Company, GTEHS was merged with and into
the Company and is currently operating as a division of the Company.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF 
DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992 

TOGETHER WITH REPORT OF 
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

<PAGE>

[Arthur Andersen LLP logo appears here] 

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To GTE Health Systems Incorporated: 

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of the
MedSeries4 Operations of GTE Health Systems Incorporated (an operating segment
of GTE Health Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation) as of December 31,
1993 and 1992, and the related statements of operations for the years then
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the accompanying financial
statements present the carved-out portion of GTE Health Systems Incorporated's
assets and liabilities and results of operations, referred to as the MedSeries4
Operations, and may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position or
results of operations that would have existed if the MedSeries4 Operations had
been operated as an unaffiliated company. Certain expenses are the result of
allocations of total expenses incurred by GTE Health Systems Incorporated and
its parent company, GTE Corporation.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the MedSeries4 Operations of
GTE Health Systems Incorporated as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of its operations for the years then ended in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-----------------------------

(Dollars in Thousands)

(1) DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE
-----------------------------------------
ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
---------------------------------

On September 30, 1994, Shared Medical Systems Corporation ("SMS") acquired
certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from GTE Health Systems
Incorporated's MedSeries4 Operations. The accompanying statements of assets and
liabilities and statements of operations present the carved-out portion of the
MedSeries4 Operations of GTE Health Systems Incorporated. This carved-out
portion is herein referred to as the "Company". These assets and liabilities and
results of operations may not necessarily be indicative of the financial
position or results of operations that would have existed if the MedSeries4
Operations had been operated as an unaffiliated company. Certain expenses are
the result of allocations of total expenses incurred by GTE Health Systems
Incorporated and its parent company, GTE Corporation. The statements of assets
and liabilities do not present the assets and liabilities to be acquired or
assumed by SMS as described in the stock purchase agreement dated September 30,
1994, but rather the assets and related liabilities of the Company which were
utilized by GTE Health Systems Incorporated ("GTEHS") in its MedSeries4
Operations.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
------------------------------------------

Recognition of Revenue 
- - ----------------------

The Company's products and services are provided to customers based upon
contractual agreement. Software license fee revenues are recognized primarily
over the installation period. Service revenues, which include professional
services and support fees, are recorded in the period in which the services are
performed. Hardware sales are recognized upon first productive use of the
equipment. All fees are billable according to the specific terms in each
customer contract.

Deferred revenues of $3,677 at December 31, 1993 and $5,360 at December 31,
1992, represent funds received by the Company in advance of services being
performed. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, accounts receivable included $2,086
and $2,110, respectively, of unbilled revenues recognized under certain long-
term software license, installation and hardware contracts. These unbilled
receivables arise from the consistent application of percentage of completion
revenue recognition policies described above, and will be billed in accordance
with the terms of the individual customer contracts, generally within 12 months
of revenue recognition.

Allocation of Parent Company General and Administrative
- - -------------------------------------------------------
Expenses and Total GTEHS Expenses 
---------------------------------

GTE Corporation ("Parent") allocates general and administrative expenses to
GTEHS based upon GTEHS' budgeted proportionate share of revenues as a percentage
of GTE Corporation consolidated revenues.

GTEHS expenses which are not specifically identifiable to the MedSeries4
Operations have been allocated to the Company primarily based upon the

10
<PAGE>

- 2 -

MedSeries4 Operations personnel as a percentage of total GTEHS personnel.
In the opinion of management, the allocation of general and administrative
expenses from the Parent to GTEHS and from GTEHS to the Company is reasonable
based upon the nature of the allocable expenses and the operations of the
Company. 

Inventories 
- - -----------

Inventories, consisting principally of computer hardware and related supplies
held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost
is determined by specific identification.

Property and Equipment 
- - ----------------------

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Major additions and improvements are
capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not
increase the useful lives of the property are expensed as incurred. Depreciation
and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets, which are five years for all categories of
property and equipment.

Computer Software Development Costs
- - -----------------------------------

Computer software development costs incurred subsequent to establishment of
technological feasibility are capitalized. Technological feasibility is
established upon achievement of a detailed program design free of high-risk
development issues. The establishment of technological feasibility and the
ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized computer software
development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to
certain external factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated future
gross revenues, estimated product life and changes in technology.

For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company invested
approximately $1,292 and $2,299, respectively, in computer software development.
Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs begins when the
product is first sold and is calculated using the straight-line method over five
years, the estimated product lives. Amortization expense for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992 was approximately $1,592 and $815, respectively.

In 1993, the Company determined it was appropriate to expense $4,300 in
capitalized costs associated with its MedSeries4 computer software based upon
management's assessment of the future realizability of these costs. This expense
is included in cost of sales in the 1993 statement of operations.

Goodwill 
- - --------

Effective October 5, 1988, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding
stock of IHC Affiliated Services, Inc. ("IHC"). In connection with this
acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $19,890 and was
amortizing this amount on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period.
Management evaluated potential impairment based upon an estimate of the related
business segment's undiscounted net income over the remaining life of the
goodwill. As of December 31, 1993, management determined that goodwill was not
recoverable and expensed the remaining balance of $8,515.

Research and Development 
- - ------------------------

The Company expenses all research and development costs, which are primarily
costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of internally-

11
<PAGE>

- 3 -

developed computer software. These expenses primarily consist of computer costs
and salaries of personnel and amounted to $1,085 in 1993 and $1,819 in 1992.

Employee Benefit Plans 
- - ----------------------

The current service costs of retirement plans and postretirement health care and
life insurance benefits are accrued as incurred. Prior service costs and credits
resulting from changes in benefits are amortized over the average remaining
service period of the employees expected to receive benefits. In years prior to
1992, the estimated costs of postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits were accounted for on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.

(3) RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
-------------------

During 1993, the Company restructured its operations resulting in a one-time 
pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $778. This increased the net loss
during 1993 by approximately $513. This restructuring charge consisted of
employee separation benefits associated with work force reductions. The work
force reductions involve 35 employees and will be implemented during 1994.

(4) PENSION PLANS 
-------------

The Company, together with other GTE Corporation subsidiaries, participates in
defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all of its employees.
Benefits are generally based on years of credited service and participants'
average final earnings. The Company contributes amounts which are determined
actuarially to provide the plans with assets sufficient to meet the benefit
obligations. The assets of the plans consist primarily of corporate equities,
government securities and corporate debt securities. Plan expenses allocated to
the Company in 1993 and 1992 were approximately $424 and $487, respectively.

(5) POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS 
-------------------------------------------

Substantially all of the Company's employees together with employees of other
GTE Corporation subsidiaries are covered under postretirement health care and
life insurance benefit plans. The health care benefits paid under these plans
are generally based on comprehensive hospital, medical and surgical benefit
provisions, while the life insurance benefits are based on annual earnings at
the time of retirement. The Company funds amounts for postretirement benefits as
deemed appropriate from time to time. The expenses allocated to the Company
related to the plans were approximately $766 and $1,472 in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

(6) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN 
---------------------

The Company provides an employee savings plan established in accordance with
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan covers substantially all
full-time employees. Under the plan, the Company provides matching contributions
in GTE Corporation common stock based on qualified employee contributions.
Matching contributions charged to income of the Company were $185 and $165 in
1993 and 1992, respectively.

12
<PAGE>

(7) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES 
----------------------------

The Company is billed by affiliated companies for data processing and other
centralized services. Expenses incurred by the Company for these services were
approximately $1,174 and $924 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
-----------------------------

Leases
- - ------

The Company leases various equipment generally for periods ranging up to 60
months. In addition, the Company leases office space expiring at various dates
through 1999. The office space leases account for 94 percent and 95 percent of
the total lease payment obligations for 1993 and 1992, respectively. Minimum
future lease payments as of December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE> 

Rental expense for these operating leases was approximately $712 and $775 in
1993 and 1992, respectively. 

Litigation 
- - ----------

In the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a defendant in
several matters of litigation. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate outcome of these matters of litigation will not
have a material adverse effect on the accompanying financial statements.

(9) INCOME TAXES 
------------

The Company's taxable income or loss is included in the consolidated federal
income tax returns of GTE Corporation. In accordance with a tax-sharing
arrangement with GTE Corporation, federal income tax expense or benefit is
allocated to the Company based on its contribution to GTE Corporation's
consolidated taxable income. The Company is allocated the full benefit for all
losses generated. The Company is paid by GTE Corporation for federal tax losses
utilized in the consolidated tax return, but the Company is not paid for
temporary differences in revenues and expenses reported for financial reporting
and income tax reporting purposes. Beginning in 1992, the Company filed state
tax returns as a separate company. No benefit for state operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $16.1 million has been recognized in the
accompanying financial statements due to uncertainty of future taxable income
against which to utilize these loss carryforwards.

As of December 31, 1993, the Company had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $7.6 million. These net operating loss
carryforwards were generated by IHC Affiliated Services, Inc. which was acquired
by the Company on October 5, 1988. Based upon provisions within the Internal
Revenue Code, significant portions, if not all, of the predecessor net operating
loss carryforwards may not be available. Accordingly, no benefit for the
predecessor net operating loss carryforwards has been provided in the
accompanying financial statements.

(10) SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS 
---------------------

The Company sells its products and services almost exclusively to hospitals
located within the United States. For the year ended December 31, 1992, the
Company generated sales from Bermuda Hospital of approximately $2,803 or 11
percent of total sales. No other single customer accounted for more than 10
percent of the Company's total sales during 1993 or 1992.
