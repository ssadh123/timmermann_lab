clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), the Trustee shall have received an
unqualified Opinion of Counsel, which opinion shall not be an expense of the
Trust, stating that such action will not, directly or indirectly, (A) adversely
affect the status of the Trust as a REMIC or the status of the Certificates as
"regular interests" therein or of the Class C Certificates as the sole class of
"residual interests" therein, (B) affect the distributions payable hereunder to
the Certificateholders or the Class C Certificateholders or (C) result in the
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Trust.

e. Upon the acquisition of any real property (including interests in real
property), or any personal property incident thereto, in connection with the
default of a Contract, the Servicer and the Trustee (at the direction of the
Servicer) shall take, or cause to be taken, such action as is necessary to sell
or otherwise dispose of such property within such period as is then required by
the Code in order for such property to qualify as "foreclosure property" within
the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, unless the Servicer and the
Trustee receive an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the holding by the
Trust of such property subsequent to the period then permitted by the Code will
not result in the imposition of any taxes on "prohibited transactions" of the
Trust, as defined in Section 860F of the Code, or cause the Trust to fail to
qualify as a REMIC at any time that the Certificates or Class C Certificates are
outstanding. The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate such real
property, or any personal property incident thereto, so that such property will
not fail to qualify as "foreclosure property," as defined in Section 860G(a)(8)
of the Code, and that the management, conservation, protection and operation of
such property will not result in the receipt by the Trust of any "income from
nonpermitted assets," within the meaning of Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
------------------------------

The Company makes the following representations and warranties, effective
as of the Closing Date, on which the Trustee will rely in accepting the
Contracts in trust and issuing the Certificates and the Class C Certificate on
behalf of the Trust. The repurchase and indemnification obligations of the
Company set forth in Section 3.05 constitute the sole remedies available to the
Trust, the Certificateholders or the Class C Certificateholder for a breach of a
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Section 3.02, 3.03 or
3.04 of this Agreement or in the Officer's Certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 2.02(j) of this Agreement.

SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties Regarding the Company.
---------------------------------------------------- 

The Company represents and warrants to the Certificateholders and the Class
C Certificateholder that:

a. Organization and Good Standing. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the corporate power to own its
assets and to transact the business in which it is currently engaged. The
Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the business

qualification and in which the failure so to qualify would have a material
adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, or condition (financial
or other) of the Company.

b. Authorization; Binding Obligations. The Company has the power and
authority to make, execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and all of
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, and to create the Trust
and cause it to make, execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
this Agreement and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and to cause the
Trust to be created. When executed and delivered, this Agreement will
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement of such
terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the availability of
equitable remedies.

c. No Consent Required. The Company is not required to obtain the
consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval or
authorization from, or registration or declaration with, any governmental
authority, bureau or agency in connection with the execution, delivery,
performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement.

d. No Violations. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company will not violate any provision of any existing law

3-1
<PAGE>
or regulation or any order or decree of any court or the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, or constitute a material breach of
any mortgage, indenture, contract or other agreement to which the Company
is a party or by which the Company may be bound.

e. Litigation. No litigation or administrative proceeding of or
before any court, tribunal or governmental body is currently pending, or to
the knowledge of the Company threatened, against the Company or any of its
properties or with respect to this Agreement, the Certificates or the Class
C Certificate which, if adversely determined, would in the opinion of the
Company have a material adverse effect on the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 3.02. Representations and Warranties Regarding Each Contract.
------------------------------------------------------ 

The Company represents and warrants to the Certificateholders and the
Class C Certificateholder as to each Contract:

a. List of Contracts. The information set forth in the List of
Contracts is true and correct as of its date.

b. Payments. As of the Cut-off Date, the most recent scheduled
payment was made by or on behalf of the Obligor or was not delinquent for
more than 59 days.

c. Costs Paid and No Waivers. The terms of the Contract have not
been waived, altered or modified in any respect, except by instruments or
documents identified in the Contract File. All costs, fees and expenses
incurred in making, closing and perfecting the lien of the Contract have
been paid. The subject real property has not been released from the lien
of such Secured Contract.

d. Binding Obligation. The Contract is the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Obligor thereunder and is enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

e. No Defenses. The Contract is not subject to any right of
rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of
usury, and the operation of any of the terms of the Contract or the
exercise of any right thereunder will not render the Contract unenforceable
in whole or in part or subject to any right of rescission, setoff,
counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and no such right
of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with
respect thereto.

f. Insurance Coverage. The Company has been named as an additional
insured party under any hazard insurance on the property described in the
Contract, to the extent required by the Company's 

3-2
<PAGE>

underwriting guidelines. If the property described in the Contract is
located in a special flood area designated by HUD, the property is covered
by a flood insurance policy of the nature and, if such Contract is an FHA-
Insured Contract, in the amount required by the FHA Regulations.

g. FHA Insurance. If the Contract is an FHA-Insured Contract, such
Contract was originated in compliance with FHA Regulations and is insured,
without set-off, surcharge or defense, by FHA Insurance. Following the
assignment of such FHA-Insured Contract to the Trustee, the Trustee on
behalf of the Trust will be entitled to the full benefits of the FHA
Insurance.

h. Lawful Assignment. The Contract was not originated in and is not
subject to the laws of any jurisdiction whose laws would make the transfer
of the Contract under this Agreement or pursuant to transfers of the
Certificates or Class C Certificate unlawful or render the Contract
unenforceable. The Company has duly executed a valid blanket assignment of
the Contracts transferred to the Trust, and has transferred all its right,
title and interest in such Contracts, including all rights the Company may
have against the originating contractor-seller with respect to Contracts
originated by a contractor-seller rather than the Company, to the Trust.
The blanket assignment, any and all documents executed by the Company
pursuant to Section 2.01(b) hereof, and this Agreement each constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms.

i. Compliance with Law. At the date of origination of the Contract,
all requirements of any federal and state laws, rules and regulations
applicable to the Contract, including, without limitation, usury and truth
in lending laws and (if such Contract is an FHA-Insured Contract) the FHA
Regulations have been complied with, and the Company shall for at least the
period of this Agreement, maintain in its possession, available for the
Trustee's inspection, and shall deliver to the Trustee upon demand,
evidence of compliance with all such requirements.

j. Contract in Force. The Contract has not been satisfied or
subordinated in whole or in part or rescinded, and the real estate securing
such Contract has not been released from the lien of such Contract in whole
or in part.

k. Valid Lien. The Contract has been duly executed and delivered by
the Obligor, and the lien created thereby has been duly recorded, or has
been delivered to the appropriate governmental authority for recording and
will be duly recorded within 180 days, and constitutes a valid and
perfected first, second or third-priority lien on the real estate described
in such Contract.

l. Capacity of Parties. The signature(s) of the Obligor(s) on the
Contract are genuine and all parties to the Contract had full legal
capacity to execute the Contract.

3-3
<PAGE>
m. Good Title. The Company is the sole owner of the Contract and, if
such Contract is an FHA-Insured Contract, because the Trustee is a lender
approved by HUD to originate and purchase Title I loans under a valid Title
I contract of insurance, has the authority to sell, transfer and assign
such Contract to the Trust under the terms of this Agreement. There has
been no assignment, sale or hypothecation of the Contract by the Company
except the usual past hypothecation of the Contract in connection with the
Company's normal banking transactions in the conduct of its business, which
hypothecation terminates upon sale of the Contract to the Trust. The
Company has good and marketable title to the Contract, free and clear of
any encumbrance, equity, loan, pledge, charge, claim, lien or encumbrance
of any type and has full right to transfer the Contract to the Trust.

n. No Defaults. As of the Cut-off Date, there was no default,
breach, violation or event permitting acceleration existing under the
Contract and no event which, with notice and the expiration of any grace or
cure period, would constitute such a default, breach, violation or event
permitting acceleration under such Contract (except payment delinquencies
permitted by clause (b) above). The Company has not waived any such
default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration except payment
delinquencies permitted by clause (b) above.

o. Equal Installments. The Contract has a fixed Contract Interest
Rate and provides for level monthly payments which fully amortize the loan
over its term.

p. Enforceability. Each Contract contains customary and enforceable
provisions so as to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof
adequate for the realization against the collateral of the benefits of the
lien provided thereby.

q. One Original. There is only one original executed Contract, which
Contract has been delivered to the Trustee or its custodian on or before
the Closing Date.

r. Genuine Documents. All documents submitted are genuine, and all
other representations as to each Contract, including the List of Contracts
delivered to the Trustee, are true and correct. Any copies of documents
provided by the Company are accurate and complete (except that, with
respect to each Contract that was originated by a contractor-seller rather
than the Company, the Company makes such representation and warranty only
to the best of the Company's knowledge).

s. Origination. The Contract was originated by a home improvement
contractor in the ordinary course of such contractor's business or was
originated by the Company directly.

3-4
<PAGE>
t. Underwriting Guidelines. Each Contract was originated or
purchased in accordance with the Company's then-current underwriting
guidelines.

SECTION 3.03. Representations and Warranties Regarding the Contracts
------------------------------------------------------
in the Aggregate.
- - - ---------------- 

The Company represents and warrants to the Certificateholders and the
Class C Certificateholder that:

a. Amounts. The aggregate principal amounts payable by Obligors
under the Contracts as of the Cut-off Date equal the Cut-Off Date Pool
Principal Balance.

b. Characteristics. The Contracts have the following
characteristics: (i) 100% of the Contracts (by principal balance as of the
Cut-off Date) are Secured Contracts; (ii) no Contract has a remaining
maturity of more than 240 months; and (iii) the final scheduled payment
date on the Contract with the latest maturity is in September 2014. No
Contract was originated before January 1, 1993. No Contract has a Contract
Interest Rate less than 8.50%.

c. Geographic Concentrations. 19.52% of the Contracts by principal
balance as of the Cut-off Date are secured by property located in (or, in
the case of Contracts that are not Secured Contracts, otherwise relate to
improvements to property located in) California, 9.57% in Florida, 7.02% in
Texas, 6.45% in New Jersey, and 6.24% in New York. No other state
represents more than 5% of the aggregate principal balance of the Contracts
as of the Cut-off Date. No more than 1% of the Contracts by remaining
principal balance as of the Cut-off Date are secured by property located in
(or, in the case of Contracts that are not Secured Contracts, otherwise
relate to improvements to property located in) an area with the same five-
digit zip code.

d. Marking Records. By the Closing Date, the Company has caused the
portions of the Electronic Ledger relating to the Contracts to be clearly
and unambiguously marked to indicate that such Contracts constitute part of
the Trust and are owned by the Trust in accordance with the terms of the
trust created hereunder.

e. No Adverse Selection. No adverse selection procedures have been
employed in selecting the Contracts.

SECTION 3.04. Representations and Warranties Regarding the Contract Files.

Class C Certificateholder that:

3-5
<PAGE>

a. Possession. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will have possession of each original Contract and the related Contract
File, and there are and there will be no custodial agreements in effect
materially and adversely affecting the rights of the Company to make, or
cause to be made, any delivery required hereunder.

b. Bulk Transfer Laws. The transfer, assignment and conveyance of
the Contracts and the Contract Files by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement is not subject to the bulk transfer or any similar statutory
provisions in effect in any applicable jurisdiction.

SECTION 3.05. Repurchases of Contracts for Breach of Representations
------------------------------------------------------
and Warranties.
- - - -------------- 

a. Subject to Section 3.06, the Company shall repurchase a Contract, at
its Repurchase Price, not later than 90 days after the day on which the Company,
the Servicer or the Trustee first discovers or should have discovered a breach
of a representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Sections 3.02, 3.03
or 3.04 of this Agreement or in the Officer's Certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 2.02(j) of this Agreement that materially adversely affects the Trust's,
the Certificateholders' or the Class C Certificateholder's interest in such
Contract and which breach has not been cured; provided, however, that (i) in the
event that a party other than the Company first becomes aware of such breach,
such discovering party shall notify the Company in writing within 5 Business
Days of the date of such discovery and (ii) with respect to any Contract
incorrectly described on the List of Contracts with respect to unpaid principal
balance, which the Company would otherwise be required to repurchase pursuant to
this Section, the Company may, in lieu of repurchasing such Contract, deposit in
the Certificate Account within 90 days from the date of such discovery cash in
an amount sufficient to cure such deficiency or discrepancy. Any such cash so
deposited shall be distributed to Certificateholders and the Class C
Certificateholder on the immediately following Payment Date as a collection of
principal or interest on such Contract, according to the nature of the
deficiency or discrepancy. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the obligation of the Company under this Section shall not terminate
upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VII.

b. Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) above, and subject to Section 3.06,
the Company shall repurchase any Contract, at its respective Repurchase Price,
if the Company has failed to deliver the related Contract File, except for an
evidence of lien on the related improved property and evidence of due recording
of such mortgage, deed of trust or security deed, if available, to the Trustee
within 30 days of the Closing Date.

c. The Company shall defend and indemnify the Trustee, the
Certificateholders, and the Class C Certificateholder against all costs,
expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any of them as
a result of any third-party action arising out of any breach of any such
representation and warranty.

3-6
<PAGE>

SECTION 3.06. No Repurchase Under Certain Circumstances.
----------------------------------------- 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
repurchase pursuant to Section 3.05 shall be made unless the Company obtains for
the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel addressed to the Trustee that any such
repurchase would not, under the REMIC Provisions, (i) cause the Trust to fail to
qualify as a REMIC while any regular interest in the REMIC is outstanding,
(ii) result in a tax on prohibited transactions within the meaning of
Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or (iii) constitute a contribution after the
startup day subject to tax under Section 860G(d) of the Code. The Servicer
shall attempt to obtain such Opinion of Counsel. Notwithstanding the absence of
such opinion as to the imposition of any tax as the result of such purchase or
deposit, the Company shall purchase such Contract (or deposit cash in the
Certificate Account as provided in the preceding section) and shall guarantee
the payment of such tax by paying to the Trustee the amount of such tax not
later than five Business Days before such tax shall be due and payable to the
extent that amounts previously paid over to and then held by the Trustee
pursuant to Section 6.06 hereof are insufficient to pay such tax and all other
taxes chargeable under Section 6.06. Pursuant to Section 6.06, the Servicer is
hereby directed to withhold, and shall withhold and pay over to the Trustee, an
amount sufficient to pay such tax and any other taxes imposed on "prohibited
transactions" under Section 860F(a)(i) of the Code or imposed on "contributions
after startup date" under Section 860G(d) of the Code from amounts otherwise
distributable to Class C Certificateholder. The Servicer shall give notice to
the Trustee at the time of such repurchase of the amounts due from the Company
pursuant to the guarantee of the Company described above and give notice as to
who should receive such payment.

The Trustee shall have no obligation to pay any such amounts pursuant to
this Section other than from moneys provided to it by the Company or from moneys
held in the funds and accounts created under this Agreement. The Trustee shall
be deemed conclusively to have complied with this Section if it follows the
directions of the Company.

In the event any tax that is guaranteed by the Company pursuant to this
Section 3.06 is refunded to the Trust or otherwise is determined not to be
payable, the Company shall be repaid the amount of such refund or that portion
of any guarantee payment made by the Company that is not applied to the payment
of such tax.

ARTICLE IV

PERFECTION OF TRANSFER AND PROTECTION OF SECURITY INTERESTS
-----------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 4.01. Transfer of Contracts.
--------------------- 

On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver the Contract
Files to the Trustee. The Trustee shall maintain the Contract Files at its
office or with a duly appointed Custodian. The Trustee may release a Contract
File to the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.07. The Company has filed a form
UCC-1 financing statement regarding the sale of the Contracts to the Trustee,
and shall file continuation statements in respect of such UCC-1 financing
statement as if such financing statement were necessary to perfect such sale.
The Company shall take any other actions necessary to maintain the perfection of
the sale of the Contracts to the Trustee.

SECTION 4.02. Costs and Expenses.
------------------ 

The Servicer agrees to pay all reasonable costs and disbursements in
connection with the perfection and the maintenance of perfection, as against all
third parties, of the Certificateholders' and the Class C Certificateholder's
right, title and interest in and to the Contracts (including, without
limitation, the mortgage or deed of trust on the related real estate granted
thereby).

ARTICLE V

SERVICING OF CONTRACTS
----------------------

SECTION 5.01. Responsibility for Contract Administration.
------------------------------------------ 

The Servicer will have the sole obligation to manage, administer, service
and make collections on the Contracts and perform or cause to be performed all
contractual and customary undertakings of the holder of the Contracts to the
Obligor. The Trustee, at the request of a Servicing Officer, shall furnish the
Servicer with any powers of attorney or other documents necessary or appropriate
to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties
hereunder. The Company is hereby appointed the Servicer until such time as any
Service Transfer shall be effected under Article VII.

SECTION 5.02. Standard of Care.
---------------- 

In managing, administering, servicing and making collections on the
Contracts pursuant to this Agreement, the Servicer will exercise that degree of
skill and care required by FHA (in the case of FHA-Insured Contracts) and
otherwise consistent with the highest degree of skill and care that the Servicer
exercises with respect to similar contracts (including manufactured housing
contracts) serviced by the Servicer; provided, however, that such degree of
skill and care shall be at least as favorable as the degree of skill and care
generally applied by servicers of home improvement contracts and promissory
notes for institutional investors.

SECTION 5.03. Records.
------- 

The Servicer shall, during the period it is servicer hereunder, maintain
such books of account and other records as will enable the Trustee to determine
the status of each Contract.

SECTION 5.04. Inspection.
---------- 

a. At all times during the term hereof, the Servicer shall afford the
Trustee and its authorized agents reasonable access during normal business hours
to the Servicer's records relating to the Contracts, which have not previously
been provided to the Trust, and will cause its personnel to assist in any
examination of such records by the Trustee. The examination referred to in this
Section will be conducted in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with
the Servicer's normal operations or customer or employee relations. Without
otherwise limiting the scope of the examination the Trustee may make, the
Trustee may, using generally accepted audit procedures, verify the status of
each Contract and review the Electronic Ledger and records relating thereto for
conformity to Monthly Reports prepared pursuant to Article VI and compliance
with the standards represented to exist as to each Contract in this Agreement.

5-1
<PAGE>

b. At all times during the term hereof, the Servicer shall keep available
a copy of the List of Contracts at its principal executive office for inspection
by Certificateholders.

c. A Certificateholder holding Certificates representing in the aggregate
at least 5% of the Aggregate Certificate Principal Balance shall have the rights
of inspection afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Section 5.04.

SECTION 5.05. Certificate Account.
------------------- 

a. On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall establish the
Certificate Account on behalf of the Trust with an Eligible Institution. The
Servicer shall pay into the Certificate Account, as promptly as practicable (not
later than the next Business Day) following receipt thereof, all amounts
received with respect to the Contracts, including all proceeds of FHA Insurance
claims received by the Servicer, other than extension fees and assumption fees,
which fees shall be retained by the Servicer as compensation for servicing the
Contracts. The Trustee shall pay into the Certificate Account as promptly as
practicable all proceeds of FHA Insurance claims with respect to FHA-Insured
Contracts received by the Trustee. All amounts paid into the Certificate
Account under this Agreement shall be held in trust for the Trustee, the
Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder until payment of any such
amounts is authorized under this Agreement. Only the Trustee may withdraw funds
from the Certificate Account.

b. If the Servicer so directs, the Eligible Institution maintaining the
Certificate Account shall, in the name of the Trustee in its capacity as such,
invest the amounts in the Certificate Account in Eligible Investments that
mature not later than one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Payment
Date. Once such funds are invested, such Eligible Institution shall not change
the investment of such funds. All income and gain from such investments shall
be added to the Certificate Account and distributed on such Payment Date
pursuant to Section 8.04(b). Losses, if any, realized on amounts in the
Certificate Account invested pursuant to this paragraph shall first be credited
against undistributed investment earnings on amounts in the Certificate Account
invested pursuant to this paragraph, and shall thereafter be deemed to reduce
the amount on deposit in the Certificate Account and otherwise available for
distribution to Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder pursuant to
Section 8.01. The Company and the Trustee shall in no way be liable for losses
on amounts invested in accordance with the provisions hereof. Funds in the
Certificate Account not so invested must be insured to the extent permitted by
law by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "Eligible Investments" are
any of the following:

(i) direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed by, the
United States of America, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the
Federal National Mortgage Association, or any agency or instrumentality of
the United States of America the obligations of which are backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America;

5-2
<PAGE>

(ii) (A) demand and time deposits in, certificates of deposit of,
bankers' acceptances issued by, or federal funds sold by any depository
institution or trust company (including the Trustee or any Affiliate of the
Trustee, acting in its commercial capacity) incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or any state thereof and subject to
supervision and examination by federal and/or state authorities, so long
as, at the time of such investment or contractual commitment providing for
such investment, the commercial paper or other short-term debt obligations
of such depository institution or trust company (or, in the case of a
depository institution which is the principal subsidiary of a holding
company, the commercial paper or other short-term debt obligations of such
holding company) are rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and (B) any
other demand or time deposit or certificate of deposit which is fully
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;

(iii) shares of an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, whose shares are registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 and have the highest credit rating then available from Standard &
Poor's, and whose only investments are in securities described in clauses
(i) and (ii) above;

(iv) repurchase obligations with respect to (A) any security described
in clause (i) above or (B) any other security issued or guaranteed by an
agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, in either case
entered into with a depository institution or trust company (acting as
principal) described in clause (ii)(A) above;

(v) securities bearing interest or sold at a discount issued by any
corporation incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or
any State thereof which have a credit rating of at least A from Standard &
Poor's at the time of such investment; provided, however, that securities
issued by any particular corporation will not be Eligible Investments to
the extent that investment therein will cause the then outstanding
principal amount of securities issued by such corporation and held as part
of the corpus of the Trust to exceed 10% of amounts held in the Certificate
Account; and

(vi) commercial paper having a rating of at least A-1 from Standard &
Poor's at the time of such investment or pledge as security.

The Trustee may trade with itself or an Affiliate in the purchase or sale
of such Eligible Investments.

SECTION 5.06. Enforcement.
----------- 

a. The Servicer shall, consistent with customary servicing procedures,
act with respect to the Contracts in such manner as will maximize the receipt of
principal and interest on such Contracts and liquidation proceeds with respect
to Liquidated Contracts. The Company shall pay all FHA Insurance premiums

5-3
<PAGE>

required by FHA Regulations in respect of FHA-Insured Contracts; if the Company
is no longer the Servicer and fails to pay such FHA Insurance premiums, the
successor Servicer shall pay such premiums and shall be entitled to
reimbursement therefor in accordance with Section 8.04. The Servicer shall
comply with FHA Regulations in servicing FHA-Insured Contracts so that the
related FHA Insurance remains in full force and effect, except for good-faith
disputes relating to FHA Regulations or such FHA Insurance.

b. In accordance with the standard of care specified in Paragraph 5.02,
the Servicer may, in its own name, if possible, or as agent for the Trust,
commence proceedings for the foreclosure of any subject real estate, and may
(with respect to an FHA-Insured Contract) submit a claim to FHA in lieu of
commencing foreclosure proceedings, or may take such other steps that in the
Servicer's reasonable judgment will maximize liquidation proceeds with respect
to the Contract, including, for example, the sale of the Contract to a third
party for foreclosure or enforcement and, in the case of any default on a
related prior mortgage loan, the advancing of funds to correct such default and
the advancing of funds to pay off a related prior mortgage loan, which advances
are liquidation expenses that will be reimbursed to the Servicer out of related
liquidation proceeds before the related Net Liquidation Proceeds are paid to
Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder. The Servicer shall also
deposit in the Certificate Account any Net Liquidation Proceeds received in
connection with any Contract which became a Liquidated Contract in a prior Due
Period.

c. The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon Contracts, in its own
name, if possible, or as agent for the Trust. If the Servicer elects to
commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Contract, the act of commencement shall
be deemed to be an automatic assignment of the Contract to the Servicer for
purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal
proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Contract on the ground
that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the
Contract, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall, at the Servicer's expense,
take such steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce the Contract,
including bringing suit in its name or the names of the Certificateholders and
the Class C Certificateholder.

d. The Servicer may grant to the Obligor on any Contract any rebate,
refund or adjustment out of the Certificate Account that the Servicer in good
faith believes is required because of prepayment in full of the Contract. The
Servicer will not permit any rescission or cancellation of any Contract.

e. The Servicer may enforce any due-on-sale clause in a Contract if such
enforcement is called for under its then current servicing policies for
obligations similar to the Contracts, provided that such enforcement is
permitted by applicable law and will not adversely affect any applicable
insurance policy. If an assumption of a Contract is permitted by the Servicer,
upon conveyance of the related property the Servicer shall use its best efforts
to obtain an assumption agreement in connection therewith.

5-4
<PAGE>

f. If, following the termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 12.04,
HUD demands reimbursement of an FHA Insurance claim paid on an FHA-Insured
Contract prior to the termination of the Trust, the Servicer agrees that it will
not seek to recover any such amount from the Trustee or the Certificateholders.

g. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Servicer shall not agree to the modification or waiver of any provision of a
Contract at a time when such Contract is not in default or such default is not
reasonably foreseeable, if such modification or waiver would be treated as a
taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code or any proposed, temporary or
final Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

SECTION 5.07. Trustee to Cooperate.
-------------------- 

a. Upon payment in full on any Contract, the Servicer will notify the
Trustee and the Company (if the Company is not the Servicer) on the next
succeeding Payment Date by certification of a Servicing Officer (which
certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received
in connection with such payments which are required to be deposited in the
Certificate Account pursuant to Section 5.05 have been so deposited) and shall
request delivery of the Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon
receipt of such delivery and request, the Trustee shall promptly release or
cause to be released such Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon
receipt of such Contract and Contract File, each of the Company (if different
from the Servicer) and the Servicer is authorized to execute an instrument in
satisfaction of such Contract and to do such other acts and execute such other
documents as the Servicer deems necessary to discharge the Obligor thereunder
and eliminate any lien on the related real estate. The Servicer shall determine
when a Contract has been paid in full; to the extent that insufficient payments
are received on a Contract credited by the Servicer as prepaid or paid in full
and satisfied, the shortfall shall be paid by the Servicer out of its own funds
and deposited in the Certificate Account.

b. If the Servicer elects to submit a claim to FHA under the FHA
Insurance in respect of an FHA-Insured Contract and payment is received from
FHA, the Servicer shall notify the Trustee and the Company (if the Company is
not the Servicer) on the next succeeding Payment Date by certification of a
Servicing Officer (which certification shall include a statement to the effect
that all amounts received in connection with such payments which are required to
be deposited in the Certificate Account pursuant to Section 5.05 have been so
deposited) and shall request delivery of the Contract and Contract File to the
Servicer. Upon receipt of such delivery and request, the Trustee shall promptly
release or cause to be released such Contract and Contract File to the Servicer.

c. From time to time as appropriate for servicing, foreclosing, and
making a claim for FHA Insurance coverage in connection with an FHA-Insured
Contract, the Trustee shall, upon written request of a Servicing Officer and
delivery to the Trustee of a receipt signed by such Servicing Officer, cause the
original Contract and the related Contract File to be released to the Servicer
and shall execute 

5-5
<PAGE>

such documents as the Servicer shall deem necessary to the prosecution of any
such proceedings. Upon request of a Servicing Officer, the Trustee shall perform
such other acts as reasonably requested by the Servicer and otherwise cooperate
with the Servicer in enforcement of the Certificateholders' rights and remedies
with respect to Contracts.

d. The Servicer's receipt of a Contract and/or Contract File shall
obligate the Servicer to return the original Contract and the related Contract
File to the Trustee when its need by the Servicer has ceased unless the Contract
shall be liquidated or repurchased as described in Section 3.05 or 8.06.

SECTION 5.08. Costs and Expenses.
------------------ 

Except as provided in Section 8.04(b) for the reimbursement of Advances,
all costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer in carrying out its duties
hereunder (including payment of FHA Insurance premiums, payment of the Trustee's
fees pursuant to Section 11.06, fees and expenses of accountants and payments of
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of Contracts
(including enforcement of Contracts and foreclosures upon real estate securing
any such Contracts) and all other fees and expenses not expressly stated
hereunder to be for the account of the Trust) shall be paid by the Servicer and
the Servicer shall not be entitled to reimbursement hereunder, except that the
Servicer shall be reimbursed out of the liquidation proceeds of a Liquidated
Contract (including FHA Insurance proceeds) for customary out-of-pocket
liquidation expenses incurred by it. The Servicer shall not incur such
liquidation expenses unless it determines in its good faith business judgment
that incurring such expenses will increase the Net Liquidation Proceeds on the
related Contract. The Servicer's out-of-pocket liquidation expenses in
connection with the submission of a claim to FHA currently do not exceed $100
per Contract.

SECTION 5.09. Maintenance of Insurance.
------------------------ 

The Servicer shall at all times keep in force a policy or policies of
insurance covering errors and omissions for failure to maintain insurance as
required by this Agreement, and a fidelity bond. Such policy or policies and
such fidelity bond shall be in such form and amount as is generally customary
among persons who service a portfolio of home improvement loans having an
aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or more, and which are generally
regarded as servicers acceptable to institutional investors. The Servicer shall
cause to be maintained with respect to any real property securing an FHA-Insured
Contract such hazard insurance and flood insurance as may be required by the FHA
Regulations, it being understood that at the Closing Date hazard insurance was
not required to be maintained under the FHA Regulations. The Servicer shall
cause to be maintained with respect to the real property securing a conventional
Contract hazard insurance (excluding flood insurance coverage) if such
conventional Contract is secured by a first priority mortgage, deed of trust or
security deed or the initial principal balance of such conventional Contract
exceeds $20,000.

SECTION 5.10 Merger or Consolidation of Servicer.
----------------------------------- 

Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party shall be the successor of
the Servicer hereunder, provided such Person shall be an Eligible Servicer,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. The
Servicer shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's in the event it is a party to
any merger, conversion or consolidation.

The Servicer shall be responsible for and agrees to prepare, make and file
all federal, state, local or other tax returns, information statements and other
returns and documents of every kind and nature whatsoever required to be made or
filed by or on behalf of the Trust pursuant to the Code and other applicable tax
laws and regulations. Each such return, statement and document shall, to the
extent required by the Code or other applicable law and at the request of the
Servicer, be signed on behalf of the Trust by the Trustee. The Trustee shall
have no responsibility whatsoever for the accuracy or completeness of any such
return, statement or document. The Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trustee and
hold it harmless for, from, against and in respect to any and all liability,
loss, damage and expense which may be incurred by the Trustee based upon or as a
result of the Trustee's execution of any and all such tax returns, statements
and documents. The Servicer, if and for so long as it is a Class C
Certificateholder, shall be designated the "tax matters person" on behalf of the
Trust in the same manner as a partnership may designate a "tax matters partner,"
as such term is defined in Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code. To the extent
permitted by the REMIC Provisions, any subsequent holder of the Class C
Certificate, by acceptance thereof, irrevocably designates and appoints the
Servicer as its agent to perform the responsibilities of the "tax matters
person" on behalf of the Trust if, and during such time as, the Servicer is not
the holder of the Class C Certificate. The Servicer may, at its expense, retain
such outside assistance as it deems necessary in the performance of its
obligations under this paragraph.

6-5
<PAGE>
Each of the Holders of the Certificates or the Class C Certificate, by
acceptance thereof, agrees to file tax returns consistent with and in accordance
with any elections, decisions or other reports made or filed with regard to
federal, state or local taxes on behalf of the Trust. The Servicer, as agent
for the tax matters person, shall represent the Trust in connection with all
examinations of the Trust's affairs by tax authorities, including resulting
administrative and judicial proceedings. Each of the holders of the
Certificates and Class C Certificates, by acceptance thereof, agrees to
cooperate with the Company in such matters and to do or refrain from doing any
or all things reasonably required by the Company to conduct such proceedings,
provided that no such action shall be required by the Company of any
Certificateholder that would entail unnecessary or unreasonable expenses for
such Certificateholder in the performance of such action.

The Class C Certificateholder shall pay, on behalf of the Trust, any
foreign, federal, state or local income, property, excise, sales, receipts or
any other similar or related taxes or charges which may be imposed upon the
Trust as a REMIC or otherwise and shall, to the extent provided in
Section 10.06, be entitled to be reimbursed out of the Certificate Account or,
if such tax or charge results from a failure by the Trustee, the Company or any
Servicer to comply with the provisions of Section 2.04 or 3.06, the Trustee, the
Company or such Servicer, as the case may be, shall indemnify the Class C
Certificateholder for the payment of any such tax or charge. The Trustee shall
be entitled to withhold from amounts otherwise distributable to the Class C
Certificateholder any taxes or charges payable by the Class C Certificateholder
hereunder.

In the event the Class C Certificate is transferred to a "disqualified
organization," within the meaning of Section 860E(e)(5) of the Code, pursuant to
Section 860D(a)(6)(B) of the Code the Company shall provide to the Internal
Revenue Service and the persons specified in Sections 860(E)(e)(3) and (6) of
the Code all information necessary for the application of Section 860E(e) and
any other applicable provision of the Code with respect to the transfer of the
Class C Certificate to such a disqualified organization including, without
limitation, a computation showing the present value of the total anticipated
excess inclusions with respect to such Class C Certificate for periods after the
transfer as defined in the REMIC Provisions. In addition, to the extent
required by the REMIC Provisions, the Company shall, upon the written request of
persons designated in Section 860E(e)(3) of the Code, furnish to such requesting
party and the Internal Revenue Service information sufficient to compute the
present value of anticipated excess inclusions within 60 days of the receipt of
such written request.

SECTION 7.02. Transfer.

a. If an Event of Termination has occurred and is continuing, either the
Trustee or Certificateholders, in the aggregate, representing 25% or more of the
Aggregate Certificate Principal Balance, by notice in writing to the Servicer
(and to the Trustee if given by the Certificateholders) may terminate all (but
not less than all) of the Servicer's management, administrative, servicing and
collection functions (such termination being herein called a "Service
Transfer"). On receipt of such notice (or, if later, on a date designated
therein), all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether
with respect to the Contracts, the Contract Files or otherwise (except with
respect to the Certificate Account, the transfer of which shall be governed by
Section 7.06), shall pass to and be vested in the Trustee pursuant to and under
this Section 7.02; and, without limitation, the Trustee is authorized and
empowered to execute and deliver on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact
or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do any and all
acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination. The Trustee shall cause all assignments of mortgages, deeds of
trust or security deeds securing Secured Contracts to be duly recorded. If the
Servicer was the lender of record for purposes of the FHA Insurance relating to
FHA-Insured Contracts, the Trustee shall notify HUD of such termination and
shall request that HUD transfer the FHA Insurance reserves allocable to such
Contracts to the successor Servicer; provided, however, that if the Trustee is
the successor Servicer, the Trustee shall request such transfer of reserves if
and to the extent it is legally able to do so, and the Trustee shall use its
best efforts to obtain any approvals that may be required for the Trustee to
receive such transfer of reserves. Each of the Company and the Servicer agrees
to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the Servicer hereunder, including, without
limitation, the transfer to the Trustee for administration by it of all cash
amounts which shall at the time be held by the Servicer for deposit, or have
been deposited by the Servicer, in the Certificate Account, or for its own
account in connection with its services hereafter or thereafter received with
respect to the Contracts, and the transfer of all rights under FHA Insurance
relating to FHA-Insured Contracts. The Servicer shall transfer to the new
servicer (i) the Servicer's records relating to the Contracts in such electronic
form as the new servicer may reasonably request and (ii) any Contract Files in
the Servicer's possession.

SECTION 7.03. Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination
pursuant to Section 7.02, the Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to
the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the
transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer
by the terms and provisions hereof, and the Servicer shall be relieved of such
responsibilities, duties and liabilities arising after such Service Transfer;
provided, however, that (i) the Trustee will not assume any obligations of the
Company pursuant to Section 3.05, and (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for
any acts or omissions of the Servicer occurring prior to such Service Transfer
or for any breach by the Servicer of any of its obligations contained herein 

7-2
<PAGE>
or in any related document or agreement. As compensation therefor, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation out of the Monthly
Servicing Fee. Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be
unwilling so to act, or shall, if it is legally unable so to act, appoint, or
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an Eligible Servicer as
the successor to the Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of
the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer hereunder. Pending
appointment of a successor to the Servicer hereunder, unless the Trustee is
prohibited by law from so acting, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as
hereinabove provided. In connection with such appointment and assumption, the
Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
payments on Contracts as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however,
that no such monthly compensation shall, without the written consent of 100% of
the Certificateholders, exceed 1/12 of .75% of the Pool Scheduled Principal
Balance with respect to the preceding Payment Date. The Trustee and such
successor shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be
necessary to effectuate any such succession.

Certificateholder.

Contracts after the effective date of the Service Transfer.

b. After the Service Transfer, the replaced Servicer shall have no
further obligations with respect to the management, administration, servicing or
collection of the Contracts and the new Servicer shall have all of such
obligations, except that the replaced Servicer will transmit or cause to be
transmitted directly to the new Servicer for its own account, promptly on
receipt and in the same form in which received, any amounts (properly endorsed
where required for the new Servicer to collect them) received as payments upon
or otherwise in connection with the Contracts.

c. A Service Transfer shall not affect the rights and duties of the
parties hereunder (including but not limited to the indemnities of the Servicer
and the Company pursuant to Article X and Sections 3.05, 11.06 and 11.12(f))
other than 

7-3
<PAGE>
those relating to the management, administration, servicing or collection of the
Contracts.

SECTION 7.06. Transfer of Certificate Account.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.02, if the Certificate Account
shall be maintained with the Servicer and an Event of Termination shall occur
and be continuing, the Servicer shall, after five days' written notice from the
Trustee, or in any event within ten days after the occurrence of the Event of
Termination, establish a new account or accounts in trust for the
Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder conforming with the
requirements of this Agreement at the trust department of the Trustee or with an
Eligible Institution other than the Servicer and promptly transfer all funds in
the Certificate Account to such new account, which shall thereafter be deemed
the Certificate Account for the purposes hereof.

succeeding Payment Date by check mailed to such Certificateholder or Class C
Certificateholder at the address for such Certificateholder or Class C
Certificateholder appearing on the Certificate Register (or, if such

Paying Agent.

b. Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate shall be
paid to the Depository, which shall credit the amount of such distribution to
the accounts of its Depository Participants in accordance with its normal
procedures. Each Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing
such distribution to the Certificate Owners that it represents and to each
indirect participating brokerage firm (a "brokerage firm" or "indirect
participating firm") for which it acts as agent. Each brokerage firm shall be
responsible for disbursing funds to the Certificate Owners that it represents.
All such credits and disbursements with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate are
to be made by the Depository and the Depository Participants in accordance with
the provisions of the Book-Entry Certificates. Neither the Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar nor the Company shall have any responsibility therefor
except as otherwise provided by applicable law. To the extent applicable and
not contrary to the rules of the Depository, the Trustee shall comply with the
provisions of the form of the Certificates as set forth in Exhibits A through C
hereto, and the Class C Certificate as set forth in Exhibit I hereto.

c. The Trustee shall appoint an Eligible Institution to be the paying

Attention: Corporate Trust Operations, as such Paying Agent. The Trustee shall
require the Paying Agent (if other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that
all amounts held by the Paying Agent for payment hereunder will be held in trust
for the benefit of the Certificateholders and Class C Certificateholder and that
it will notify the Trustee of any failure by the Servicer to make funds
available to the Paying Agent for the payment of amounts due on the Certificates
and the Class C Certificate.

advance Delinquent Payments only to the extent that the Servicer, in its sole
discretion, expects to be able to recover such advances from subsequent
collections, including Net Liquidation Proceeds and (in the case of FHA-Insured
Contracts) proceeds of FHA Insurance, on the related Contracts. If the Servicer
fails to advance all Delinquent Payments required under this Section 8.02, the
Trustee shall be obligated to advance such Delinquent Payments pursuant to
Section 11.16.

b. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of an Advance from

the Weighted Average Pass-Through Rate, plus (y) the fair market value of

THE CERTIFICATES AND THE CLASS C CERTIFICATE
--------------------------------------------

SECTION 9.01. The Certificates and Class C Certificates.

The Class A-1, the Class M-1, the Class B-1, the Class B-2 and the Class C
Certificates shall be substantially in the forms set forth in Exhibits A, B, C
and I, as applicable, and shall, on original issue, be executed by the Trustee
on behalf of the Trust to or upon the order of the Company. The Certificates
shall be evidenced by (i) one or more Class A-1 Certificates representing
$101,600,000 initial aggregate principal balance, (ii) one or more Class M-1
Certificates representing $12,000,000 initial aggregate principal balance,
(iii) one or more Class B-1 Certificates representing $9,400,000 initial
aggregate principal balance, and (iv) one or more Class B-2 Certificates
representing $10,717,766 initial aggregate principal balance, beneficial
ownership of such Classes of Certificates to be held through Book-Entry
Certificates in minimum dollar denominations of $1,000. The Class C Certificate
shall be evidenced by a single Class C Certificate issued on the Closing Date to
the Company and shall represent 100% of the Percentage Interest of Class C.

The Certificates and the Class C Certificate shall be executed by manual
signature on behalf of the Trustee by a duly authorized Responsible Officer or
authorized signatory. Certificates or the Class C Certificate bearing the
signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the
Trustee shall bind the Trustee, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of
them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the execution and delivery of
such Certificate or Class C Certificate, or did not hold such offices at the
date of such Certificates or Class C Certificate. No Certificate or Class C
Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement, or be valid
for any purpose, unless such Certificate or Class C Certificate has been
executed by manual signature in accordance with this Section, and such signature
upon any Certificate or Class C Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and
the only evidence, that such Certificate or Class C Certificate has been duly
executed and delivered hereunder. All Certificates and the Class C Certificate
shall be dated the date of their execution, except for those Certificates and
the Class C Certificate executed on the Closing Date, which shall be dated the
Closing Date.

SECTION 9.02. Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates and
the Class C Certificate.

a. The Trustee shall keep at the office or agency to be maintained in
accordance with Section 12.02 a "Certificate Register" in which the Trustee
shall provide for the registration of Certificates and the Class C Certificate
and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates and the Class C Certificate as
herein provided. The Trustee initially appoints itself to be the "Certificate
Registrar" and transfer agent for the purpose of registering Certificates and
the Class C Certificate and transfers and exchanges of Certificates and the
Class C Certificate as provided herein. The Trustee will give prompt written
notice to Certificateholders, the Class C Certificateholder and the Servicer of
any change in the Certificate Registrar.

9-1
<PAGE>
b. (1) Subject to clauses (2) and (3) below, no transfer of a Class C
Certificate shall be made by the Company or any other Person unless such
transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Act"), as amended, and any applicable state securities laws or is
made in accordance with the Act and laws. In the event that any such transfer
is to be made, (A) the Company may require a written Opinion of Counsel
acceptable to and in form and substance satisfactory to the Company that such
transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption, describing the applicable
exemption and the basis therefor, from the Act and laws or is being made
pursuant to the Act and laws, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense
of the Trustee or the Company, and (B) the Trustee shall require the transferee
to execute an investment letter substantially in the form of Exhibit K attached
hereto, which investment letter shall not be an expense of the Trustee or the
Company. The Class C Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer shall,
and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trustee, the Company and the Certificate
Registrar against any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt
or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

(2) No transfer of a Class M-1, Class B-1 or Class B-2 Certificate or
a Class C Certificate or any interest therein shall be made to any employee
benefit plan, trust or account that is subject to ERISA, or that is
described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (each, a "Plan"), unless the
prospective transferee of a Certificate or interest therein provides the
Servicer and the Trustee with a certification of facts and, at its own
expense, an Opinion of Counsel which establish to the satisfaction of the
Servicer and the Trustee that such transfer will not result in a violation
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or cause the Servicer,
the Company or the Trustee to be deemed a fiduciary of such Plan or result
in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code. Unless
such opinion is delivered, each person acquiring such a Certificate will be
deemed to represent to the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer that such
person is neither a Plan, nor acting on behalf of a Plan, subject to ERISA
or to Section 4975 of the Code.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
(A) neither the Class C Certificate, nor any interest therein, shall be
transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of to a "disqualified
organization," within the meaning of Section 860E(e)(5) of the Code (a
"Disqualified Organization"), including, but not limited to, (i) the United
States, a state or political subdivision thereof, a foreign government, an
international organization or an agency or instrumentality of any of the
foregoing, (ii) an organization (other than a cooperative described in
Section 521 of the Code) which is exempt from the taxes imposed by Chapter
1 of the Code and not subject to the tax imposed on unrelated business
income by Section 511 of the Code, or (iii) a cooperative described in
Section 1381(a)(2)(C) of the Code, and (B) prior to any registration of any
transfer, sale or other disposition of the Class C Certificate, the
proposed transferee shall deliver to the Trustee, 

9-2
<PAGE>
under penalties of perjury, an affidavit that such transferee is not a
Disqualified Organization, with respect to which the Trustee shall have no
actual knowledge that such affidavit is false, and the transferor and the
proposed transferee shall each deliver for the Trustee an affidavit with
respect to any other information reasonably required by the Trustee
pursuant to the REMIC Provisions, including, without limitation,
information regarding the transfer of noneconomic residual interests and
transfers of any residual interest to or by a foreign person; provided,
however, that, upon the delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel,
in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and rendered by
Independent counsel, to the effect that the beneficial ownership of the
Class C Certificate by any Disqualified Organization will not result in the
imposition of federal income tax upon the Trust or any Certificateholder or
any other person or otherwise adversely affect the status of the Trust as a
REMIC, the foregoing prohibition on transfers, sales and other
dispositions, as well as the foregoing requirement to deliver a certificate
prior to any registration thereof, shall, with respect to such Disqualified
Organization, terminate. Notwithstanding any transfer, sale or other
disposition of the Class C Certificate, or any interest therein, to a
Disqualified Organization or the registration thereof in the Certificate
Register, such transfer, sale or other disposition and any registration
thereof, unless accompanied by the Opinion of Counsel described in the
preceding sentence, shall be deemed to be void and of no legal force or
effect whatsoever and such Disqualified Organization shall be deemed to not
be the Class C Certificateholder for any purpose hereunder, including, but
not limited to, the receipt of distributions on the Class C Certificate,
and shall be deemed to have no interest whatsoever in the Class C
Certificate. Each Class C Certificateholder, by his acceptance thereof,
shall be deemed for all purposes to have consented to the provisions of
this Section 9.02(b)(3).

(4) Any transfer, sale or other disposition not in compliance with 
the provisions of this Section 9.02(b) shall be deemed to be void and of no
legal force or effect whatsoever and such transferee shall be deemed to not
be the Certificateholder or Class C Certificateholder, as applicable, for
any purpose hereunder, including, but not limited to, the receipt of
distributions on the Certificate or Class C Certificate, and shall be
deemed to have no interest whatsoever in the Certificate or Class C
Certificate.

(5) The Trustee shall give notice to Standard & Poor's promptly
following any transfer, sale or other disposition of the Class C
Certificate.

c. At the option of a Certificateholder or the Class C Certificateholder,
Certificates and the Class C Certificate may be exchanged for other Certificates
or Class C Certificates of authorized denominations of a like aggregate original
denomination, upon surrender of such Certificates or the Class C Certificate to
be exchanged at such office. Whenever any Certificates or the Class C
Certificate are so surrendered for exchange, the Trustee shall execute and
deliver the Certificates or Class C Certificates which the Certificateholder or
Class C Certificateholder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every
Certificate or Class C Certificate presented 

9-3
<PAGE>
or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed by, or shall be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the holder thereof or his
or her attorney duly authorized in writing.

d. Except as provided in paragraph (e) below, the Book-Entry Certificates
shall at all times remain registered in the name of the Depository or its
nominee and at all times: (i) registration of the Certificates may not be
transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository; (ii) the Depository
shall maintain book-entry records with respect to the Certificate Owners and
with respect to ownership and transfers of such Certificates; (iii) ownership
and transfers of registration of the Certificates on the books of the Depository
shall be governed by applicable rules established by the Depository; (iv) the
Depository may collect its usual and customary fees, charges and expenses from
its Depository Participants; (v) the Trustee shall deal with the Depository,
Depository Participants and indirect participating firms as representatives of
the Certificate Owners of the Certificates for purposes of exercising the rights
of Holders under this Agreement, and requests and directions for and votes of
such representatives shall not be deemed to be inconsistent if they are made
with respect to different Certificate Owners; and (vi) the Trustee may rely and
shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository
with respect to its Depository Participants and furnished by the Depository
Participants with respect to indirect participating firms and persons shown on
the books of such indirect participating firms as direct or indirect Certificate
Owners.

All transfers by Certificate Owners of Book-Entry Certificates shall be
made in accordance with the procedures established by the Depository Participant
or brokerage firm representing such Certificate Owner. Each Depository
Participant shall only transfer Book-Entry Certificates of Certificate Owners it
represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as agent in accordance with
the Depository's normal procedures.

e. If (x)(i) the Company or the Depository advises the Trustee in writing
that the Depository is no longer willing or able properly to discharge its
responsibilities as Depository and (ii) the Trustee or the Company is unable to
locate a qualified successor or (y) the Company at its sole option advises the
Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the
Depository, the Trustee shall notify all Certificate Owners, through the
Depository, of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
definitive, fully registered Certificates (the "Definitive Certificates") to
Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Trustee of the
Certificates by the Depository, accompanied by registration instructions from
the Depository for registration, the Trustee shall issue the Definitive
Certificates. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay
in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates all references herein to obligations imposed upon or to be
performed by the Depository shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by
the Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive
Certificates and the Trustee 

9-4
<PAGE>
shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders
hereunder.

f. On or prior to the Closing Date, there shall be delivered to the
Depository one Class A-1 Certificate, one Class M-1 Certificate, one Class B-1
Certificate, and one Class B-2 Certificate each in registered form registered in
the name of the Depository's nominee, Cede & Co., the total face amount of which
represents 100% of the Original Class A-1 Principal Balance, the Original Class
M-1 Principal Balance, the Original Class B-1 Principal Balance, and the
Original Class B-2 Principal Balance, respectively. Each such Certificate
registered in the name of the Depositary's nominee shall bear the following
legend:

"Unless this Certificate is presented by an authorized representative of
The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC") to the Trustee or
its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate
issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as
requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to
Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized
representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR
OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner
hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein."

SECTION 9.03. No Charge; Disposition of Void Certificates or Class C
Certificate.

No service charge shall be made to a Certificateholder or Class C
Certificateholder for any transfer or exchange of Certificates or the Class C
Certificate, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates or the Class C
Certificate. All Certificates or the Class C Certificate surrendered for
transfer and exchange shall be disposed of in a manner approved by the Trustee.

SECTION 9.04. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates or Class C
Certificate.

If (a) any mutilated Certificate or Class C Certificate is surrendered to
the Certificate Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate or Class C
Certificate, and (b) there is delivered to the Certificate Registrar and the
Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by each to save it
harmless, then in the absence of notice to the Certificate Registrar or the
Trustee that such Certificate or Class C Certificate has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser, the Trustee shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in
lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate or Class C
Certificate, a new Certificate or Class C Certificate of like tenor and original
denomination. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate or Class C Certificate
under this Section 9.04, the Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to 

9-5
<PAGE>
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation
thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. Any duplicate Certificate
or Class C Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall constitute
complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership of the Percentage Interest, as
if originally issued, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificate or Class C Certificate shall be found at any time.

SECTION 9.05. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentation of a Certificate or Class C Certificate for
registration of transfer, the Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent and the Certificate Registrar may treat the person in whose name any
Certificate or Class C Certificate is registered as the owner of such
Certificate or Class C Certificate for the purpose of receiving remittances
pursuant to Section 8.01 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the
Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Paying Agent
or any agent of the Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the
Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 9.06. Access to List of Certificateholders' and Class C
Certificateholder's Names and Addresses.

The Certificate Registrar will furnish to the Trustee and the Servicer,
within five days after receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request
therefor from the Trustee in writing, a list, in such form as the Trustee may
reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders and the
Class C Certificateholder as of the most recent Record Date. If Holders of
Certificates representing, in the aggregate, 25% or more of the Aggregate
Certificate Principal Balance apply in writing to the Trustee (hereinafter
referred to as "Applicants"), and such application states that the Applicants
desire to communicate with other Certificateholders or the Class C
Certificateholder with respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the
Certificates or the Class C Certificate and is accompanied by a copy of the
communication which such Applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall,
within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford such
Applicants access during normal business hours to the most recent list of
Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder held by the Trustee. If
such list is as of a date more than 90 days prior to the date of receipt of such
Applicants' request, the Trustee shall promptly request from the Certificate
Registrar a current list as provided above, and shall afford such Applicants
access to such list promptly upon receipt. Every Certificateholder and the
Class C Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate or the Class C
Certificate, agrees with the Certificate Registrar and the Trustee that none of
the Company, the Certificate Registrar or the Trustee shall be held accountable
by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders or the Class C Certificateholder hereunder,
regardless of the source from which such information was derived.

9-6
<PAGE>
SECTION 9.07. Authenticating Agents.

The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with power to act
on its behalf and subject to its direction in the execution and delivery of the
Certificates or the Class C Certificate. For all purposes of this Agreement,
the execution and delivery of Certificates or the Class C Certificate by the
Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be the
execution and delivery of Certificates or the Class C Certificate "by the
Trustee."

charges, except to the extent set forth in the following proviso, shall be
expenses and costs of the Trust and the Class C Certificateholder shall be
entitled to be reimbursed therefor out of the Certificate Account as provided in
Section 8.04; provided, however, that any such taxes or charges shall not be
expenses or costs of the Trust, nor will the Class C Certificateholder be
entitled to reimbursement therefor out of the Certificate Account, if and to the
extent that such taxes or charges resulted from a failure by the Company, the
Trustee or any Servicer to comply with the provisions of Section 2.04.

THE TRUSTEE
-----------

SECTION 11.01. Duties of Trustee.

The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after
the curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement. If an Event of Termination has occurred (which has not been cured),
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his
own affairs.

The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to the
Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform as to form to the requirements of this Agreement.

Subject to Section 11.03, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed
to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:

a. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, and after the
curing of all such Events of Termination which may have occurred, the duties and
obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions
of this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of
such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee
may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to
the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement;

b. The Trustee shall not be liable for an error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that
the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

c. The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the direction of the Certificateholders representing, in the aggregate, 25% or
more of the Aggregate Certificate Principal Balance relating to the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee,
or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this
Agreement;

11-1
<PAGE>
d. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any event referred
to in Section 7.01 unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate
Trust Office obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Trustee receives
written notice of such event from the Servicer or the Certificateholders
representing, in the aggregate, 25% or more of the Aggregate Certificate
Principal Balance; and

e. The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from taking any action in reliance on the advice of the Servicer in all matters
with respect to FHA Insurance. The Trustee shall not be liable for any actions
taken by the Servicer with respect to FHA Insurance, including but not limited
to the maintenance of such insurance and the submission of claims to FHA.

None of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event
require the Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance
of, any of the obligations of the Company or the Servicer under this Agreement,
except during such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and
be vested with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Servicer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Trustee shall not be required
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment
of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

SECTION 11.02. Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.01:

a. The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any resolution, Officer's Certificate, certificate of a
Servicing Officer, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or
other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties;

b. The Trustee may consult with counsel and any opinion of any counsel
for the Company or the Servicer shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by the Trustee
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

c. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers vested in it by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation hereunder or in relation hereto, at the request, order or direction
of any of the Certificateholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
unless such Certificateholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred therein or thereby; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall relieve the Trustee of the obligations, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Termination (which has not been cured), to exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Agreement, and 

11-2
<PAGE>

to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent man
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs;

d. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after the
curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, the Trustee shall
not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless
requested in writing so to do by Certificateholders representing, in the
aggregate, 25% or more of the Aggregate Certificate Principal Balance; provided,
however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the
costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such
investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the
Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Agreement, the
Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such cost, expense or liability
as a condition to so proceeding. The reasonable expense of every such
examination shall be paid by the Servicer or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be
reimbursed by the Servicer upon demand; and

e. The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or
perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
attorneys or a custodian and shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of
such agents, attorneys or custodians if appointed by it with due care hereunder.

SECTION 11.03. Trustee Not Liable for Certificates, the Class C Certificate
------------------------------------------------------------
or Contracts.
- - - ------------ 

The Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the recitals
contained herein, in the Certificates or in the Class C Certificate (other than
the Trustee's execution thereof). The Trustee makes no representations as to
the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement, of the Certificates or of the
Class C Certificate (other than its execution thereof) or of any Contract,
Contract File or related document. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the
use or application by the Servicer or the Company of funds paid to the Company
in consideration of conveyance of the Contracts to the Trust by the Company or
deposited in or withdrawn from the Certificate Account by the Servicer.

SECTION 11.04. Trustee May Own Certificates.
---------------------------- 

The Trustee in its individual or other capacity may become the owner or
pledgee of Certificates representing less than all the beneficial interest in
the Trust with the same rights as it would have if it were not Trustee.

SECTION 11.05. Rights of Certificateholders to Direct Trustee and to Waive
-----------------------------------------------------------
Events of Termination.
- - - --------------------- 

Holders of Certificates representing, in the aggregate, 25% or more of the
Aggregate Certificate Principal Balance shall have the right to direct the time,

11-3
<PAGE>

method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee; provided,
however, that, subject to Section 11.01, the Trustee shall have the right to
decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel
determines that the action so directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the
Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the
Trustee, determine that the proceedings so directed would be illegal or involve
it in personal liability or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of
Certificateholders not parties to such direction; and provided further that
nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right of the Trustee to take any
action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such
direction by the Certificateholders. Holders of the Certificates representing,
in the aggregate, 51% or more of the Aggregate Certificate Principal Balance may
on behalf of Certificateholders waive any past Event of Termination hereunder
and its consequences, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision
hereof which under Section 12.08 cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of all Certificateholders, and upon any such waiver, such Event of
Termination shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been cured for
every purpose of this Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Event of Termination or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 11.06. The Servicer to Pay Trustee's Fees and Expenses.
----------------------------------------------- 

The Servicer agrees:

a. to pay to the Trustee reasonable compensation for all services
rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
trust);

b. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
Trustee, to the extent requested by the Trustee, for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in
accordance with any provision of this Agreement (including the reasonable
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel),
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to
its negligence or bad faith; and

c. to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of this trust and its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of
defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the
exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

The covenants in this Section 11.06 shall be for the benefit of the Trustee
in its capacities as Trustee, Paying Agent and Certificate Registrar hereunder,
and shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

11-4
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.07. Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.
------------------------------------ 

The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a financial institution
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and a
Title I approved lender pursuant to FHA Regulations, whose long-term debt (or,
in the case of First Trust National Association, its parent company) is rated
BBB or higher by Standard & Poor's, and shall have a combined capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000 or shall be a member of a bank holding system
the aggregate combined capital and surplus of which is $50,000,000, provided
that the Trustee's separate capital and surplus shall at all times be at least
the amount required by Section 310(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended. If such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of a supervising or examining authority,
then for the purposes of this Section 11.07, the combined capital and surplus of
such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the
Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 11.07, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in Section 11.08.

SECTION 11.08. Resignation or Removal of Trustee.
--------------------------------- 

The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby
created by giving written notice thereof to the Servicer and the Company. Upon
receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to each of the Servicer and the Company and one
copy to the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so
appointed and shall have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of
such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with
the provisions of Section 11.07 and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Company, or if at any time the Trustee shall be legally unable
to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the
Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take
charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose
of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Company may remove the
Trustee. If the Company shall have removed the Trustee under the authority of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the
successor trustee.

Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 11.08 shall not become
effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided
in Section 11.09.

11-5
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.09. Successor Trustee.
----------------- 

Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 11.08 shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Servicer, the Company and to its predecessor
Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become effective and
such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee. The
predecessor Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the successor
Trustee the Contracts and the Contract Files and any related documents and
statements held by it hereunder; and, if the Contracts are then held by a
custodian pursuant to a custodial agreement, the predecessor Trustee and the
custodian shall amend such custodial agreement to make the successor Trustee the
successor to the predecessor Trustee thereunder; and the Servicer, the Company
and the predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do
such other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting
and confirming in the successor Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and
obligations. If the predecessor Trustee is then the lender of record for
purposes of FHA Insurance (due to an Event of Termination), the predecessor
Trustee shall submit a report to FHA describing the transfer of the FHA-Insured
Contracts without recourse, in such form as is then required under FHA
Regulations to cause HUD to transfer to the successor Trustee the FHA insurance
reserves applicable to the FHA-Insured Contracts.

No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section
11.09 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 11.07.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as provided in this
Section 11.09, the Servicer shall cause notice of the succession of such Trustee
hereunder to be mailed to Standard & Poor's and to each Certificateholder and
the Class C Certificateholder at their addresses as shown in the Certificate
Register. If the Servicer fails to mail such notice within ten days after
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall
cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Servicer.

SECTION 11.10. Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.
---------------------------------- 

Any Person into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to
the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the
Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be eligible under the provisions
of Section 11.07, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding. The Trustee shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's in the
event it is a party to any merger, conversion or consolidation.

11-6
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.11. Tax Returns.
----------- 

Upon the Servicer's request, the Trustee will furnish the Servicer with all
such information as the Servicer may reasonably require in connection with
preparing all tax returns of the Trust and the Trustee shall execute such
returns.

SECTION 11.12. Obligor Claims.
-------------- 

In connection with any offset defenses, or affirmative claims for recovery,
asserted in legal actions brought by Obligors under one or more Contracts based
upon provisions therein complying with, or upon other rights or remedies arising
from, any legal requirements applicable to the Contracts, including, without
limitation, the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule Concerning
Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses (16 C.F.R. (S) 433) as amended
from time to time:

a. The Trustee is not, and shall not be deemed to be, either in any
individual capacity, as trustee hereunder or otherwise, a creditor, or a
joint venturer with or an Affiliate of, or acting in concert or cooperation
with, any seller of home improvements, in the arrangement, origination or
making of Contracts. The Trustee is the holder of the Contracts only as
trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders and the Class C
Certificateholder, and not as a principal or in any individual or personal
capacity;

b. The Trustee shall not be personally liable for or obligated to pay
Obligors any affirmative claims asserted thereby, or responsible to
Certificateholders or the Class C Certificateholder for any offset defense
amounts applied against Contract payments, pursuant to such legal actions;

c. The Trustee will pay, solely from available Trust monies,
affirmative claims for recovery by Obligors only pursuant to final judicial
orders or judgments, or judicially approved settlement agreements,
resulting from such legal actions;

d. The Trustee will comply with judicial orders and judgments which
require its actions or cooperation in connection with Obligors' legal
actions to recover affirmative claims against Certificateholders and the
Class C Certificateholder;

e. The Trustee will cooperate with and assist Certificateholders and
the Class C Certificateholder in their defense of legal actions by Obligors
to recover affirmative claims if such cooperation and assistance is not
contrary to the interests of the Trustee as a party to such legal actions
and if the Trustee is satisfactorily indemnified for all liability, costs
and expenses arising therefrom; and

f. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend
the Trustee, Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder from 

11-7
<PAGE>

and against any and all liability, loss, costs and expenses of the Trustee,
Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder resulting from any
affirmative claims for recovery asserted or collected by Obligors under the
Contracts. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
obligation of the Company under this Section 11.12(f) shall not terminate
upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VII.

SECTION 11.13. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.
--------------------------------------------- 

Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, for the purpose
of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction having authority over the
Trust, the Contracts or the Obligors, the Company and Trustee acting jointly
shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint
one or more Persons approved by the Trustee to act as co-trustee or co-trustees,
jointly with the Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or
any part of the Trust, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity,
such title to the Trust, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other
provisions of this Section 11.13, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and
trusts as the Company and the Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If
the Company shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the
receipt by it of a request to do so, or in case an Event of Termination shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make
such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required
to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 11.07
hereunder and no notice to Certificateholders or the Class C Certificateholder
of the appointment of co-trustee(s) or separate trustee(s) shall be required
under Section 11.09 hereof.

In the case of any appointment of a co-trustee or separate trustee pursuant
to this Section 11.13 all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
performed by the Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, except
to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act
or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the
Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations
(including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate
trustee at the direction of the Trustee.

Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed
to have been given to each of the then co-trustees and separate trustees, as
effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any co-
trustee or separate trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of
this Article XI. Each co-trustee and separate trustee, upon its acceptance of
the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in
its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as
may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this 

11-8
<PAGE>

Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording
protection to, the Trustee. Every such instrument shall be filed with the
Trustee.

Any co-trustee or separate trustee may, at any time, constitute the
Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any co-trustee or separate trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor trustee.

SECTION 11.14. Certain Matters Relating to FHA Insurance.
----------------------------------------- 

a. In the event the Company and the successor Servicer, if any, shall
fail to pay all FHA Insurance premiums with respect to the FHA-Insured Contracts
required by FHA Regulations, the Trustee shall pay such FHA Insurance premiums
and shall be entitled to reimbursement for such amounts pursuant to Section
8.04(b)(4).

b. If, following the termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 12.04,
HUD demands reimbursement from the Trustee of an FHA Insurance claim paid on an
FHA-Insured Contract prior to the termination of the Trust, the Trustee agrees
that it will not seek to recover any such amount from any Person other than the
Company or successor Servicer.

SECTION 11.15. Trustee and First Bank System, Inc.
---------------------------------- 

In the event the Trustee ceases to be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
First Bank System, Inc., the Trustee shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's.

SECTION 11.16 Trustee Advances.
---------------- 

a. If the Servicer fails to deposit into the Certificate Account Advances
as required by Section 8.02, then the Trustee shall, subject to the provisions
of paragraph (b) below, from its own funds, deposit into the Certificate Account
the amount not so deposited by the Servicer on or before the Business Day
preceding the related Payment Date (a "Trustee Advance").

b. The Trustee shall not be required to make any Trustee Advance (i) if
and to the extent that it determines in good faith that the funds, if advanced,
would not be recoverable by it from subsequent collections, including Net
Liquidation Proceeds, or (in the case of FHA-Insured Contracts) from FHA
Insurance, or (ii) if the Trustee is prohibited by law from making any such
Trustee Advance, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel.

c. The Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement of a Trustee Advance
from subsequent collections on the related Contract, including Net Liquidation
Proceeds and (in the case of FHA-Insured Contracts) proceeds of FHA Insurance,
in 

11-9
<PAGE>

accordance with Section 8.04(b). If the Trustee determines in good faith that
any Trustee Advance has become an Uncollectible Advance, the Trustee will be
entitled to reimbursement of such Uncollectible Advance from the Collected
Amount in accordance with Section 8.04(b).

SECTION 12.01. Servicer Not to Resign.
---------------------- 

The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except upon determination that the performance of its duties

permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel for the Servicer to such effect delivered to the Trustee. No such
resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or a successor servicer
shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer in
accordance with Section 7.03.

SECTION 12.02. Company Not to Engage in Certain Transactions with Respect

Certificateholder mailed no later than the fifth Business Day of the month of
the Final Payment Date specifying (1) the Final Payment Date upon which final

Date is not applicable, payments being made only upon presentation and surrender
of the Certificates and the Class C Certificate at the office or agency of the

of the Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder of a plan of
complete liquidation within the meaning of Section 860F of the Code on the date
such notice is given when signed by the Trustee. Each such notice shall, to the
extent required by the REMIC Provisions or other applicable law, be signed on
behalf of the Trust by the Trustee. The Trustee shall give such notice to the
Certificate Registrar at the time such notice is given to the Certificateholders

to the remaining Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder to
surrender their Certificates and the Class C Certificate for cancellation and
receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within three months
after the second notice all the Certificates and the Class C Certificate shall
not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Company shall transfer to itself
all amounts remaining on deposit in the Certificate Account, to hold in trust
for Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder who have not
surrendered their Certificates or the Class C Certificate, as the case may be,
for cancellation, together with the final record list of Certificateholders and
the Class C Certificateholder, and the Company shall take appropriate steps, or
may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the remaining
Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates and to contact the
Class C Certificateholder concerning its surrender of its Class C Certificate,
and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other assets which
remain in trust hereunder.

------------------------------------------
Certificateholder.
- - - -----------------

a. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, whenever
Certificateholder approval, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver,
or other action is required hereunder, such approval, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be deemed to have been given or
taken on behalf of, and shall be binding upon, all Certificateholders if agreed

duly appointed in writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly provided,
such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are
delivered to the Trustee and, where required, to the Servicer. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall
be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and (subject to Section 11.01)
conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Servicer and the Company if made in the
manner provided in this Section.

Class C Certificateholder of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any
reasonable manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

changes as are necessary to maintain the status of the Trust as a "real estate
mortgage investment conduit" under the REMIC Provisions of the Code or to
otherwise effectuate the benefits of such status to the Trust, the
Certificateholders or the Class C Certificateholder, including, without
limitation, to implement any provision permitted by law that would enable a
REMIC to avoid the imposition of any tax, or to make any other provisions with
respect to matters or questions arising under this Agreement that shall not be
inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that such
action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel for the Company,
adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder.

b. This Agreement may also be amended by agreement of the Trustee and the
Company at any time without the consent of the Certificateholders or the Class C

the Certificates will not be lowered or withdrawn following such amendment.

c. This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Servicer,
the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of Holders of Certificates
representing, in the aggregate, 66 2/3% or more of the Aggregate Certificate
Principal Balance, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of
modifying in any manner the rights of such Certificateholders; provided,
however, that no such amendment shall (a) reduce in any manner the amount of, or
delay the timing of, collections of payments on the Contracts or distributions
which are required to be made on any Certificate, (b) reduce the aforesaid
percentage required to consent to any such amendment, without the consent of the
holders of all Certificates then outstanding, (c) result in the disqualification
of the Trust as a REMIC under the Code, (d) adversely affect the status of the
Trust as a REMIC or the status of the Certificates as "regular interests"
therein or (e) cause any tax (other than any tax imposed on "net income from
foreclosure property" under Section 860G(c)(1) of the Code that 

12-5
<PAGE>

would be imposed without regard to such amendment) to be imposed on the Trust,
including, without limitation, any tax imposed on "prohibited transactions"
under Section 860F(a)(1) of the Code or on "contributions after the startup
date" under Section 860G(d)(1) of the Code. This Agreement may not be amended
without the consent of the Class C Certificateholder, for the purpose of adding
any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions
of this Agreement which would modify in any manner the rights of the Class C
Certificateholder.

d. This Agreement shall not be amended under this Section without the
consent of 100% of Certificateholders and the Class C Certificateholder if such
amendment would result in the disqualification of the Trust as a REMIC under the
Code.

e. Concurrently with the solicitation of any consent pursuant to this
Section 12.08, the Trustee shall furnish written notification to Standard &
Poor's. Promptly after the execution of any amendment or consent pursuant to
this Section 12.08, the Trustee shall furnish written notification of the
substance of such amendment to Standard & Poor's and each Certificateholder and
the Class C Certificateholder.

f. It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders and
the Class C Certificateholder under this Section 12.08 to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall
approve the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of
evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders and
the Class C Certificateholder shall be subject to such reasonable requirements
as the Trustee may prescribe.

g. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such
amendment which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under
this Agreement or otherwise.

h. In connection with any amendment pursuant to this Section, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive an Opinion of Counsel to the Servicer to the effect
that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement.

i. Upon the execution of any amendment or consent pursuant to this
Section 12.08, this Agreement shall be modified in accordance therewith, and

and every Certificateholder or the Class C Certificateholder hereunder shall be
bound thereby.

j. In the absence of the consent described in subsection (d) of this
Section, in connection with any amendment pursuant to this Section, the Trustee
shall have received an unqualified Opinion of Counsel, the expense of which
shall not be an expense of the Trust, stating that any such amendment (i) will
not adversely affect the status of the Trust as a REMIC or the status of the
Certificates as "regular interests" therein, and (ii) will not cause any tax
(other than any tax imposed on 

12-6
<PAGE>
"net income from foreclosure property" under Section 860G(c)(1) of the Code that
would be imposed without regard to such amendment) to be imposed on the Trust,

FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

The opinion of Dorsey & Whitney shall be to the effect that (capitalized
terms have the meanings set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement):

1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota, with corporate power
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (including the Limited Guaranty contained therein), the Certificates
and the Class C Certificate. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
performance of its duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
Certificates and the Class C Certificate would require such qualification.

2. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement has been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action, duly executed and delivered by the Company, and
constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in
accordance with their terms. The Certificates have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action and, when duly and validly executed by the Trustee in
accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, will be validly issued and
outstanding and entitled to the benefits of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

3. No consent, approval, authorization or order of any state or federal
court or governmental agency or body is required to be obtained by the Company
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, except such as may be required under blue sky laws under
any jurisdiction in connection with the offering of the Certificates by
Underwriter pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.

4. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement is not required to be qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as now in effect, and the Trust is not
required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

5. Neither the transfer of the Contracts to the Trustee acting on behalf
of the Trust, nor the assignment of the Company's lien on the related real
estate which is the subject of a home improvement loan, nor the issuance or sale
of the Certificates and the Class C Certificate, nor the execution and delivery
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (including the Limited Guaranty contained
therein), nor the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated in
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, nor the fulfillment of the terms of the
Certificates, the Class C Certificate or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by
the Company will conflict with, or result in a breach, violation or acceleration
of, or constitute a default under, any term or provision of the Restated
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the 

F-1
<PAGE>
Company or of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to us to
which the Company is a party or by which it is bound, or result in a violation
of, or contravene the terms of any statute, order or regulation, applicable to
the Company, of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
governmental body having jurisdiction over it.

6. There are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the best of our
knowledge, actions, proceedings or investigations pending or overtly threatened
against the Company before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal
(A) asserting the invalidity of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
Certificates, the Class C Certificate, the hazard or flood insurance policies
applicable to any Contracts or the Errors and Omissions Protection Policy,
(B) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates or the Class C
Certificate or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (C) which is likely materially and adversely to
affect the performance by the Company of its obligations under, or the validity
or enforceability of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificates or
the Class C Certificate, or (D) seeking adversely to affect the federal income
tax attributes of the Certificates or the Class C Certificate described in the
Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Certain Federal
Income Tax Consequences."

7. The Company is duly registered as a finance company in each state in
which Contracts were originated, to the extent such registration is required by
applicable law.

8. The transfer of the Contracts to the Trust in accordance with Section
2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement would not be avoidable as a
preferential transfer under Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11
U.S.C. (S) 547), as in effect on the date hereof, in the event that the Company
became a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

9. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement the Company has
transferred to the Trustee acting on behalf of the Trust all of the Company's
right, title and interest in the Contracts, free and clear of any and all other
assignments, encumbrances, options, rights, claims, liens or security interests
(except tax or possessory liens) that may affect the right of the Trustee in and
to such Contracts, and has delivered the Contract Files to the Trustee or its
custodian. No filing or other action, other than the filing of a financing
statement on Form UCC-1 with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota
identifying the Contracts as collateral and naming the Company as debtor and the
Trust as secured party, and the filing of continuation statements as required by
Section 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, is necessary to perfect as
against third parties the assignment of the Contracts by the Company to the
Trust. We have separately provided you with our opinion concerning whether such
assignment could be recharacterized as a pledge rather than a sale in the event
the Company became a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code. However,
in the event such assignment were characterized as a pledge securing a loan from
the Certificateholders to the Company, it is our opinion that the Trustee would
be deemed to have a valid and perfected security 

F-2
<PAGE>
interest in the Contracts and the proceeds thereof, which security interest
would be prior to any other security interest that may be perfected under the
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of Minnesota and over any
"lien creditor" (as defined in Minn. Stat. (S)336.9-301(3)) who becomes such
after the Closing Date, except that a subsequent purchaser of any Contract who
gives new value and takes possession thereof in the ordinary course of his
business would have priority over the Trustee's security interest in such
Contract, if such purchaser acts without knowledge that such Contract was
subject to a security interest. We have assumed for the purposes of this opinion
that during the term of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement the Trustee, or its
custodian, shall maintain possession of the Contract Files for the purpose of
perfecting the assignment to the Trustee of the Contracts. We express no opinion
with respect to the enforceability of any individual Contract or the existence
of any claims, rights or other matters in favor of any Obligor or the owner of
any financed home improvement.

10. In reliance upon certain representations and warranties set forth in
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and assuming that the Company and the
Trustee comply with the requirements of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
including the filing of a proper election, as of the date hereof the Trust
created pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will qualify as a REMIC.
Further, the Certificates will evidence ownership of the "regular interests" and
the Class C Certificate will evidence ownership of the single class of "residual
interest" in such REMIC. For Minnesota income tax purposes, and subject to the
foregoing assumptions, and the provisions of Minnesota law as of the date
hereof, such Trust will not be subject to tax and the income of such Trust will
be taxable to the holders of interests therein, all in accordance with the
provisions of the Code concerning REMICs as amended through December 31, 1993.
Moreover, ownership of a Certificate will not be a factor in determining whether
such owner is subject to Minnesota income taxes. Therefore, if the owner of a
Certificate is not otherwise subject to Minnesota income or franchise taxes in
the State of Minnesota, such owner will not become subject to such Minnesota
taxes solely by virtue of owning a Certificate.

11. The transfer of the Contracts and the proceeds thereof by the Company
to the Trustee on the date hereof pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement would not be avoidable as a fraudulent transfer under the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act as in effect in Minnesota on the date hereof (Minn.
Stat. (S)(S) 513.41 through 513.51), nor, should the Company become a debtor
under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as a fraudulent transfer under Section
548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. (S) 548) as in effect on the
date hereof.

so long as the Agreement has not been terminated, by check to the registered

to the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
or that is described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (each, a "Plan") will be
registered unless the transferee, at its expense, delivers to the Trustee and
the Servicer an opinion of counsel (satisfactory to the Trustee and the
Servicer) that such transfer will not result in a violation of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or cause the Servicer, the Company or the
Trustee to be deemed to be a fiduciary of such Plan or result in the imposition
of an excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code. Unless such opinion is

the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer that such person is neither a Plan,
nor acting on behalf of a Plan, subject to ERISA or to Section 4975 of the Code.

the Trustee in Minneapolis or St. Paul, Minnesota, accompanied by a written

forth, this Class C Certificate is exchangeable for new Class C Certificates of

the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar may treat the person in whose name
this Class C Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and
neither the Company, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Certificate Registrar nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

federal tax return of the Trust for its first taxable year shall provide that

returns consistent with and in accordance with any elections, decisions or other
reports made or filed with regard to federal, state or local taxes on behalf of

RE: Certificates for Home Improvement Loans, Series 1994-CI, Class C

The undersigned purchaser (the "Purchaser") understands that the purchase
of the above-referenced certificates (the "Certificates") may be made only by
institutions which are "Accredited Investors" under Regulation D, as promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), which includes
banks, savings and loan associations, registered brokers and dealers, insurance
companies, investment companies, and organizations described in Section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, corporations, business trusts and
partnerships, not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the Certificates
offered, with total assets in excess of $5,000,000. The undersigned represents
on behalf of the Purchaser that the Purchaser is an "Accredited Investor" within
the meaning of such definition. The Purchaser is urged to review carefully the
responses, representations and warranties it is making herein.

Representations and Warranties
- - - ------------------------------

The Purchaser makes the following representations and warranties in order
to permit the Trustee, Green Tree Financial Corporation, and Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to determine its suitability as a purchaser
of Certificates and to determine that the exemption from registration relied
upon by Green Tree Financial Corporation under Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act is
available to it.

1. The Purchaser understands that the Certificates have not been and will
not be registered under the 1933 Act and may be resold (which resale is not
currently contemplated) only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the
1933 Act or if an exemption from registration is available, that Green Tree
Financial Corporation is not required to register the Certificates and that any
transfer must comply with Section 9.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
relating to the Certificates.

2. The Purchaser will comply with all applicable federal and state
securities laws in connection with any subsequent resale of the Certificates.

3. The Purchaser is a sophisticated institutional investor and has
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Certificates and is
able to bear the economic risk of such investment. The Purchaser has reviewed
the Prospectus Supplement dated September 23, 1994 to the Prospectus dated June
7, 1994 (the "Prospectus") with respect to the Certificates, and has been given
such information concerning the Certificates, the underlying installment sale
contracts and Green Tree Financial Corporation as it has requested.

4. The Purchaser is acquiring the Certificates as principal for its own
account (or for the account of one or more other institutional investors for
which it is acting as duly authorized fiduciary or agent) for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any

K-1
<PAGE>

distribution thereof, subject nevertheless to any requirement of law that the
disposition of the Purchaser's property shall at all times be and remain within
its control.

5. The Purchaser does not qualify as (i) an employee benefit plan (a
"Plan") as defined in section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), whether or not it is subject to the
provisions of Title I of ERISA, (ii) a plan described in section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (also a "Plan"), or (iii) an entity whose
underlying assets are deemed to be assets of a Plan by reason of such Plan's
investment in the entity (as determined under Department of Labor Regulations,

a. There is hereby created, by the Company as settlor, a separate trust
which shall be known as Home Improvement Loan Trust Series 1994-CII. The Trust

benefit of the Certificateholders.

b. The Company hereby transfers, assigns, sets over and otherwise conveys
to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, by execution of an assignment
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, (i) all the right, title and
interest of the Company in and to the Contracts, including all interest and

Bond as such policy and bond relate to the Contracts, (iii) all documents

title and interest to such items, in the event such transfer is deemed to be a
pledge to secure indebtedness, the Company shall be deemed to have granted to
the Trustee a perfected first priority security interest in such items.

c. Although the parties intend that the conveyance of the Company's

parties to such loan shall be established pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. If the conveyance is deemed to be a loan, the parties further intend
and agree that the Company shall be deemed to have granted to the Trustee, and
the Company does hereby grant to the Trustee, a perfected first-priority
security interest in the items designated in Section 2.01(b)(i) through

under applicable law. If the trust created by this Agreement terminates prior
to the satisfaction of the claims of any Person under any Certificates, the
security interest created hereby shall continue in full force and effect and the
Trustee shall be deemed to be the collateral agent for the benefit of such
Person.

hypothecation of the Contract by the Company except the usual past
hypothecation of the Contract in connection with the Company's normal
banking transactions in the conduct of its business, which hypothecation
terminates upon sale of the Contract to the Trust. The Company has good
and marketable title to the Contract, free and clear of any encumbrance,
equity, loan, pledge, charge, claim, lien or encumbrance of any type and

(iv) repurchase obligations with respect to (A) any security described
in clause (i) above or (B) any other security issued or guaranteed by an
agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, in either case
entered into with a depository institution or trust company (acting as
principal) described in clause (ii)(A) above;

(v) securities bearing interest or sold at a discount issued by any
corporation incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or
any State thereof which have a credit rating of at least A from Standard &
Poor's at the time of such investment; provided, however, that securities
issued by any particular corporation will not be Eligible Investments to
the extent that investment therein will cause the then outstanding
principal amount of securities issued by such corporation and held as part
of the corpus of the Trust to exceed 10% of amounts held in the Certificate
Account; and

(vi) commercial paper having a rating of at least A-1 from Standard &
Poor's at the time of such investment or pledge as security.

The Trustee may trade with itself or an Affiliate in the purchase or sale
of such Eligible Investments.

SECTION 5.06. Enforcement.

a. The Servicer shall, consistent with customary servicing procedures,
act with respect to the Contracts in such manner as will maximize the receipt of
principal and interest on such Contracts and liquidation proceeds with respect
to Liquidated Contracts.

b. In accordance with the standard of care specified in Paragraph 5.02,
the Servicer may, in its own name, if possible, or as agent for the Trust, take
such steps that in the Servicer's reasonable judgment will maximize liquidation
proceeds with 

5-3
<PAGE>

respect to the Contract, including, for example, the sale of the Contract to a
third party for enforcement and, in the case of any default on a related prior
mortgage loan, the advancing of funds to correct such default and the advancing
of funds to pay off a related prior mortgage loan, which advances are
liquidation expenses that will be reimbursed to the Servicer out of related
liquidation proceeds before the related Net Liquidation Proceeds are paid to
Certificateholders. The Servicer shall also deposit in the Certificate Account
any Net Liquidation Proceeds received in connection with any Contract which
became a Liquidated Contract in a prior Due Period.

c. The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon Contracts, in its own
name, if possible, or as agent for the Trust. If the Servicer elects to
commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Contract, the act of commencement shall
be deemed to be an automatic assignment of the Contract to the Servicer for
purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal
proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Contract on the
grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce
the Contract, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall, at the Servicer's
expense, take such steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce the
Contract, including bringing suit in its name or the names of the
Certificateholders.

d. The Servicer may grant to the Obligor on any Contract any rebate,
refund or adjustment out of the Certificate Account that the Servicer in good
faith believes is required because of prepayment in full of the Contract. The
Servicer will not permit any rescission or cancellation of any Contract.

e. The Servicer may enforce any due-on-sale clause in a Contract if such
enforcement is called for under its then current servicing policies for
obligations similar to the Contracts, provided that such enforcement is
permitted by applicable law and will not adversely affect any applicable
insurance policy. If an assumption of a Contract is permitted by the Servicer,
upon conveyance of the related property the Servicer shall use its best efforts
to obtain an assumption agreement in connection therewith.

f. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Servicer shall not agree to the modification or waiver of any provision of a
Contract, if such modification or waiver would be treated as a taxable exchange
under Section 1001 of the Code or any proposed, temporary or final Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

SECTION 5.07. Trustee to Cooperate.
-------------------- 

a. Upon payment in full on any Contract, the Servicer will notify the
Trustee and the Company (if the Company is not the Servicer) on the next
succeeding Payment Date by certification of a Servicing Officer (which
certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received
in connection with such payments which are required to be deposited in the
Certificate Account pursuant to Section 5.05 have been so deposited) and shall
request delivery of the Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon
receipt of such delivery and 

5-4
<PAGE>

request, the Trustee shall promptly release or cause to be released such
Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon receipt of such Contract and
Contract File, each of the Company (if different from the Servicer) and the
Servicer is authorized to execute an instrument in satisfaction of such Contract
and to do such other acts and execute such other documents as the Servicer deems
necessary to discharge the Obligor thereunder and eliminate any lien on the
related real estate. The Servicer shall determine when a Contract has been paid
in full; to the extent that insufficient payments are received on a Contract
credited by the Servicer as prepaid or paid in full and satisfied, the shortfall
shall be paid by the Servicer out of its own funds and deposited in the
Certificate Account.

b. The Servicer's receipt of a Contract and/or Contract File shall
obligate the Servicer to return the original Contract and the related Contract
File to the Trustee when its need by the Servicer has ceased unless the Contract
shall be liquidated or repurchased as described in Section 3.05 or 8.06.

SECTION 5.08. Costs and Expenses.
------------------ 

Except as provided in Section 8.04(b) for the reimbursement of Advances,
all costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer in carrying out its duties
hereunder (including, payment of the Trustee's fees pursuant to Section 11.06,
fees and expenses of accountants and payments of all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the enforcement of Contracts and all other fees and expenses
not expressly stated hereunder to be for the account of the Trust) shall be paid
by the Servicer and the Servicer shall not be entitled to reimbursement
hereunder, except that the Servicer shall be reimbursed out of the liquidation
proceeds of a Liquidated Contract for customary out-of-pocket liquidation
expenses incurred by it. The Servicer shall not incur such liquidation expenses
unless it determines in its good faith business judgment that incurring such
expenses will increase the Net Liquidation Proceeds on the related Contract.

SECTION 5.09. Maintenance of Insurance.
------------------------ 

The Servicer shall at all times keep in force a policy or policies of
insurance covering errors and omissions for failure to maintain insurance as
required by this Agreement, and a fidelity bond. Such policy or policies and
such fidelity bond shall be in such form and amount as is generally customary
among persons who service a portfolio of home improvement loans having an
aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or more, and which are generally
regarded as servicers acceptable to institutional investors.

SECTION 5.10 Merger or Consolidation of Servicer.
----------------------------------- 

Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party shall be the successor of
the Servicer hereunder, provided such Person shall be an Eligible Servicer,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties 

5-5
<PAGE>

hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. The Servicer shall
promptly notify Standard & Poor's in the event it is a party to any merger,
conversion or consolidation.

SECTION 7.02. Transfer.

If an Event of Termination has occurred and is continuing, either the
Trustee or Certificateholders with aggregate Percentage Interests representing
25% or more of the Trust, by notice in writing to the Servicer (and to the
Trustee if given by the Certificateholders) may terminate all (but not less than
all) of the Servicer's management, administrative, servicing and collection
functions (such termination being herein called a "Service Transfer"). On
receipt of such notice (or, if later, on a date designated therein), all
authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect
to the Contracts, the Contract Files or otherwise (except with respect to the
Certificate Account, the transfer of which shall be governed by Section 7.06),
shall pass to and be vested in the Trustee pursuant to and under this Section
7.02; and, without limitation, the Trustee is authorized and empowered to
execute and deliver on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise,
any and all documents and other instruments, and to do any and all acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination. Each of the Company and the Servicer agrees to cooperate with the
Trustee in effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the
Servicer hereunder, including, without limitation, the transfer to the Trustee
for administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be held by
the Servicer for deposit, or have been deposited by the Servicer, in the
Certificate Account, or for its own account in connection with its services
hereafter or thereafter received with respect to the Contracts. The Servicer

(ii) any Contract Files in the Servicer's possession.

SECTION 7.03. Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination
pursuant to Section 7.02, the Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to
the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the
transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer
by the terms and provisions hereof, and the Servicer shall be relieved of such
responsibilities, duties and liabilities arising after such Service Transfer;
provided, however, that (i) the Trustee will not assume any obligations of the
Company pursuant to Section 3.05, and (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for
any acts or omissions of the Servicer occurring prior to such Service Transfer
or for any breach by the Servicer of any of its obligations contained herein or
in any related document or agreement. As compensation therefor, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation out of the Monthly
Servicing Fee. Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be
unwilling so to act, or shall, if it is legally unable so to act, appoint, or
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an Eligible Servicer as
the successor to the Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of
the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer hereunder. Pending
appointment of a successor to the Servicer hereunder, unless the Trustee is
prohibited by law from so acting, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as
hereinabove provided. In connection with such 

7-2
<PAGE>

appointment and assumption, the Trustee may make such arrangements for the
compensation of such successor out of payments on Contracts as it and such
successor shall agree; provided, however, that no such monthly compensation
shall, without the written consent of 100% of the Certificateholders, exceed
1/12 of .75% of the Pool Scheduled Principal Balance. The Trustee and such
successor shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be
necessary to effectuate any such succession.

SECTION 7.04. Notification to Certificateholders

a. Promptly following the occurrence of any Event of Termination, the
Servicer shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee, to Standard & Poor's

to the Servicer pursuant to this Article VII, the Trustee shall give written
notice thereof to Standard & Poor's and to Certificateholders at their
respective addresses appearing on the Certificate Register.

further obligations with respect to the management, administration, servicing or
collection of the Contracts and the new Servicer shall have all of such
obligations, except that the replaced Servicer will transmit or cause to be
transmitted directly to the new Servicer for its own account, promptly on
receipt and in the same form in which received, any amounts (properly endorsed
where required for the new Servicer to collect them) received as payments upon
or otherwise in connection with the Contracts.

c. A Service Transfer shall not affect the rights and duties of the
parties hereunder (including but not limited to the indemnities of the Servicer
and the Company pursuant to Article X and Sections 3.05, 11.06 and 11.12(f))
other than those relating to the management, administration, servicing or
collection of the Contracts.

SECTION 7.06. Transfer of Certificate Account.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.02, if the Certificate Account
shall be maintained with the Servicer and an Event of Termination shall occur
and be continuing, the Servicer shall, after five days' written notice from the

PAYMENTS

SECTION 8.01. Monthly Payments.

a. Subject to the terms of this Article VIII, each holder of a
Certificate as of a Record Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Payment
Date by check mailed to such Certificateholder at the address for such
Certificateholder appearing on the Certificate Register (or, if such
Certificateholder holds Certificates with an aggregate Percentage Interest of at
least 5% and so requests, by wire transfer pursuant to instructions delivered to
the Trustee at least 10 days prior to such Payment Date), the sum equal to such
Certificateholder's Percentage Interest of Monthly Interest and Monthly
Principal. Final payment of any Certificate shall be made only upon
presentation of such Certificate at the office or agency of the Paying Agent.

b. Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate shall be
paid to the Depository, which shall credit the amount of such distribution to
the accounts of its Depository Participants in accordance with its normal
procedures. Each Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing
such distribution to the Certificate Owners that it represents and to each
indirect participating brokerage firm (a "brokerage firm" or "indirect
participating firm") for which it acts as agent. Each brokerage firm shall be
responsible for disbursing funds to the Certificate Owners that it represents.
All such credits and disbursements with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate are
to be made by the Depository and the Depository Participants in accordance with
the provisions of the Book-Entry Certificates. Neither the Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar nor the Company shall have any responsibility therefor
except as otherwise provided by applicable law. To the extent applicable and
not contrary to the rules of the Depository, the Trustee shall comply with the
provisions of the form of the Certificates as set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

c. The Trustee shall appoint an Eligible Institution to be the paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") and cause it to make the payments to the
Certificateholders required hereunder. The Trustee initially appoints its
corporate trust operations department, with an office at 180 East 5th Street,
Third Floor, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101, Attention: Corporate Trust Operations,
as such Paying Agent. The Trustee shall require the Paying Agent (if other than
the Trustee) to agree in writing that all amounts held by the Paying Agent for
payment hereunder will be held in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders and that it will notify the Trustee of any failure by the
Servicer to make funds available to the Paying Agent for the payment of amounts
due on the Certificates.

SECTION 8.02. Advances.

a. Not later than one Business Day following the Determination Date, the
Servicer shall advance all Delinquent Payments for the immediately preceding Due
Period by depositing the aggregate amount of such Delinquent Payments in the
Certificate Account; provided, however, that the Servicer shall be obligated to

8-1
<PAGE>

advance Delinquent Payments only to the extent that the Servicer, in its sole
discretion, expects to be able to recover such advances from subsequent
collections, including Net Liquidation Proceeds on the related Contracts. If
the Servicer fails to advance all Delinquent Payments required under this
Section 8.02, the Trustee shall be obligated to advance such Delinquent Payments
pursuant to Section 11.15.

b. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of an Advance from
subsequent collections on the related Contract, including Net Liquidation
Proceeds in accordance with Section 8.04(b). If the Servicer determines in good
faith that any Advance has become an Uncollectible Advance, the Servicer will be
entitled to reimbursement of such Uncollectible Advance from the Collected
Amount in accordance with Section 8.04(b).

SECTION 8.03. Limited Guaranty.

a. If the Monthly Report as of any Determination Date indicates that (a)
the sum of (i) the Collected Amount plus (ii) any Advances that will be
deposited in the Certificate Account by the Servicer or the Trustee, as
applicable, plus (iii) the aggregate of the Repurchase Prices for Contracts to
be repurchased by the Company in respect of such Determination Date pursuant to
Section 3.05, is less than (b) the aggregate amount payable on the immediately
following Payment Date pursuant to Section 8.04(b)(1)-(4) (such difference being
hereinafter referred to as a "Shortfall"), then, if the Company is the Servicer,
the Company shall pay into the Certificate Account not later than one Business
Day after such Determination Date the lesser of (a) such Shortfall, or (b) the
Guaranty Amount. If the Company is not the Servicer, the Servicer shall deliver
to the Company, no later than one Business Day after such Determination Date, a
written demand that the Company pay under the Limited Guaranty the amount
specified in the preceding sentence; upon receipt of such demand, the Company
shall pay such amount into the Certificate Account not later than two Business
Days before the related Payment Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the obligation of the Company under this Section shall be
irrevocable, unconditional and not terminate upon a Service Transfer pursuant to
Article VII.

b. On any Payment Date the Company shall be obligated pursuant to the
Limited Guaranty only up to the Guaranty Amount. The "Guaranty Amount" shall
equal:

(i) $1,154,601 prior to the first Payment Date under this Agreement.

(ii) Thereafter, on any Payment Date, $1,154,601 minus all Net
Liquidation Losses realized on the Contracts since the Cut-off date.

c. The obligation of the Company to provide the Limited Guaranty under
this Agreement shall terminate on the Final Payment Date.

8-2
<PAGE>

d. If the Company fails to make any payment required under the Limited
Guaranty, the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee, and the Trustee shall
promptly notify Standard & Poor's.

SECTION 8.04. Payments.

a. On each Determination Date the Servicer shall determine the following
amount of funds (the "Amount Available"): (i) the Collected Amount as of such
Determination Date; plus (ii) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the aggregate
amount of Advances that will be deposited in the Certificate Account by the
Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.02 or 11.15, (2)
the amount to be deposited by the Company in the Certificate Account pursuant to
the Limited Guaranty in accordance with Section 8.03, and (3) the aggregate of
the Repurchase Prices for Contracts to be repurchased by the Company in respect
of such Determination Date pursuant to Section 3.05.

b. On each Payment Date the Trustee shall apply the Amount Available (as
determined on the immediately preceding Determination Date) in the Certificate
Account to make payment in the following order of priority:

1. to pay Monthly Interest to the Certificateholders; provided that
the portion of the Amount Available to be applied to the payment of such
Monthly Interest shall in no event exceed the sum of (a) amounts received
in respect of interest on the Contracts, plus (b) any payments received in
respect of the Limited Guaranty other than payments with respect to amounts
included in Monthly Principal;

2. to pay Monthly Principal to the Certificateholders;

3. to pay the Servicer the Monthly Servicing Fee or such other
compensation owed to the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.03;

4. to reimburse the Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, for prior
Advances that have been recovered and for any Uncollectible Advances; and

5. to pay the remainder, if any, of the Amount Available to the
Company as the fee for providing the Limited Guaranty.

c. If the Trustee shall not have received the applicable Monthly Report
by any Payment Date, the Trustee shall distribute all funds then in the
Certificate Account to Certificateholders as Monthly Interest and then Monthly
Principal, to the extent of such funds, on such Payment Date.

SECTION 8.05. Reassignment of Repurchased Contracts.

Upon receipt by the Trust by deposit in the Certificate Account of the
Repurchase Price under Section 3.05, and upon receipt of a certificate of a
Servicing Officer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I, the Trustee shall
convey and assign 

8-3
<PAGE>

to the Company all of the Certificateholders' right, title and interest in the
repurchased Contract without recourse, representation or warranty, except as to
the absence of liens, charges or encumbrances created by or arising as a result
of actions of the Trustee. Upon such deposit of the Repurchase Price, the

THE CERTIFICATES
----------------

SECTION 9.01. The Certificates.
---------------- 

The Certificates shall be substantially in the forms set forth in Exhibit
A, and shall, on original issue, be executed by manual or facsimile signature of
the Company by any one of its President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer
or other authorized officers and authenticated by the Trustee to or upon the
order of the Company upon receipt. The Certificates shall be evidenced by (i)
one or more Certificates representing $12,482,163.00 initial aggregate principal
balance, beneficial ownership of such Certificates to be held through Book-Entry
Certificates in minimum dollar denominations of $1,000, and (ii) a single
Certificate representing $.33 in initial principal balance.

The Certificates shall be authenticated by manual signature on behalf of
the Trustee by a duly authorized Responsible Officer or authorized signatory.
Certificates bearing the signatures of individuals who were at any time the
proper officers of the Trustee shall bind the Trustee, notwithstanding that such
individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the
authentication and delivery of such Certificate or did not hold such offices at
the date of such Certificates. No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit
under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless such Certificate has
been authenticated by manual signature in accordance with this Section, and such
signature upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only
evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered
hereunder. All Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication,
except for those Certificates authenticated on the Closing Date, which shall be
dated the Closing Date.

SECTION 9.02. Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.
----------------------------------------------------- 

a. The Trustee shall keep at the office or agency to be maintained in
accordance with Section 12.02 a "Certificate Register" in which the Trustee
shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and
exchanges of Certificates as herein provided. The Trustee initially appoints
itself to be the "Certificate Registrar" and transfer agent for the purpose of
registering Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Certificates as provided
herein. The Trustee will give prompt written notice to Certificateholders and
the Servicer of any change in the Certificate Registrar.

b. No transfer of a Certificate by, on behalf of or with plan assets of
any employee benefit plan, trust or account that is subject to ERISA, or that is
described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (each, a "Plan") will be registered
unless the transferee, at its expense, delivers to the Trustee, the Servicer and
the Company an opinion of counsel (satisfactory to the Trustee, the Servicer and
the Company) that the purchase and holding of a Certificate by, on behalf of, or
with Plan assets of such Plan is permissible under applicable law, will not
result in the assets of the Trust 

9-1
<PAGE>

being deemed to be Plan assets and subject to the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and the Code and will not subject the Trustee, the Trust,
the Company or the Servicer to any obligation or liability in addition to those
undertaken in this Agreement. Unless such opinion is delivered, each person
acquiring a Certificate will be deemed to represent to the Trustee, the Company
and the Servicer that such person is neither a Plan, nor acting on behalf of a
Plan, nor purchasing with Plan assets of any Plan.

c. At the option of a Certificateholder, Certificates may be exchanged
for other Certificates of authorized denominations of a like aggregate original
denomination, upon surrender of such Certificates to be exchanged at such
office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Trustee
shall execute and deliver the Certificates which the Certificateholder making
the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Certificate presented or surrendered
for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed by, or shall be accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his or her
attorney duly authorized in writing.

d. Except as provided in paragraph (e) below the Book-Entry Certificates
shall at all times remain registered in the name of the Depository or its
nominee and at all times: (i) registration of the Certificates may not be
transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository; (ii) the Depository
shall maintain book-entry records with respect to the Certificate Owners and
with respect to ownership and transfers of such Certificates; (iii) ownership
and transfers of registration of the Certificates on the books of the Depository
shall be governed by applicable rules established by the Depository; (iv) the
Depository may collect its usual and customary fees, charges and expenses from
its Depository Participants; (v) the Trustee shall deal with the Depository,
Depository Participants and indirect participating firms as representatives of
the Certificate Owners of the Certificates for purposes of exercising the rights
of Holders under this Agreement, and requests and directions for and votes of
such representatives shall not be deemed to be inconsistent if they are made
with respect to different Certificate Owners; and (vi) the Trustee may rely and
shall be fully protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository
with respect to its Depository Participants and furnished by the Depository
Participants with respect to indirect participating firms and persons shown on
the books of such indirect participating firms as direct or indirect Certificate
Owners.

All transfers by Certificate Owners of Book-Entry Certificates shall be
made in accordance with the procedures established by the Depository Participant
or brokerage firm representing such Certificateholder. Each Depository
Participant shall only transfer Book-Entry Certificates of Certificate Owners it
represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as agent in accordance with
the Depository's normal procedures.

e. If (x)(i) the Company or the Depository advises the Trustee in writing
that the Depository is no longer willing or able properly to discharge its

9-2
<PAGE>

responsibilities as Depository, and (ii) the Trustee or the Company is unable to
locate a qualified successor, or (y) the Company at its sole option advises the
Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the
Depository, the Trustee shall notify all Certificate Owners, through the
Depository, of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
definitive, fully registered Certificates (the "Definitive Certificates") to
Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Trustee of the
Certificates by the Depository, accompanied by registration instructions from
the Depository for registration, the Trustee shall issue the Definitive
Certificates. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay
in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates all references herein to obligations imposed upon or to be
performed by the Depository shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by
the Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive
Certificates and the Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive
Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.

f. On or prior to the Closing Date, there shall be delivered to the
Depository one Certificate, in registered form, registered in the name of the
Depository's nominee, Cede & Co., the total face amount of which represents
$12,482,163.00. Such Certificate shall bear the following legend:

"Unless this Certificate is presented by an authorized representative of
The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Trustee or
its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate
issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as
requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to
Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized
representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR
OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner
hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein."

SECTION 9.03. No Charge; Disposition of Void Certificates.
------------------------------------------- 

No service charge shall be made to a Certificateholder for any transfer or
exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates. All Certificates
surrendered for transfer and exchange shall be disposed of in a manner approved
by the Trustee.

SECTION 9.04. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.
------------------------------------------------- 

If (a) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate
Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (b) there is delivered to
the Certificate Registrar and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be
required by each to save it harmless, then in the absence of notice to the
Certificate Registrar or the Trustee that 

9-3
<PAGE>

such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Trustee shall
execute and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate a new Certificate of like tenor and
original denomination. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this
Section 9.04, the Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
any other expenses connected therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued
pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall constitute complete and indefeasible
evidence of ownership of the Percentage Interest, as if originally issued,
whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall be
found at any time.

SECTION 9.05. Persons Deemed Owners.
--------------------- 

Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer,
the Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Certificate
Registrar may treat the person in whose name any Certificate is registered as
the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving remittances pursuant
to Section 8.01 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Servicer,
the Company, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Paying Agent or any
agent of the Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the
Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 9.06. Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and Addresses.
--------------------------------------------------------- 

The Certificate Registrar will furnish to the Trustee and the Servicer,
within five days after receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request
therefor from the Trustee in writing, a list, in such form as the Trustee may
reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders as of
the most recent Record Date. If Holders of Certificates evidencing Percentage
Interests representing 25% or more apply in writing to the Trustee (hereinafter
referred to as "Applicants"), and such application states that the Applicants
desire to communicate with other Certificateholders with respect to their rights
under this Agreement or under the Certificates and is accompanied by a copy of
the communication which such Applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee
shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford
such Applicants access during normal business hours to the most recent list of
Certificateholders held by the Trustee. If such list is as of a date more than
90 days prior to the date of receipt of such Applicants' request, the Trustee
shall promptly request from the Certificate Registrar a current list as provided
above, and shall afford such Applicants access to such list promptly upon
receipt. Every Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate,
agrees with the Certificate Registrar and the Trustee that none of the Company,
the Certificate Registrar or the Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of
the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the
Certificateholders hereunder, regardless of the source from which such
information was derived.

9-4
<PAGE>

SECTION 9.07. Authenticating Agents.
--------------------- 

The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with power to act
on its behalf and subject to its direction in the execution and delivery of the
Certificates. For all purposes of this Agreement, the execution and delivery of
Certificates by the Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall be
deemed to be the execution and delivery of Certificates "by the Trustee."

including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation
arising out of or resulting from the use or ownership of any real estate related
to a Contract by the Company or the Servicer or any Affiliate of either.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligation of the

Trust, including, without limitation, any sales, gross receipts, general
corporation, personal property, privilege or license taxes (but not including

imposed against the Trust, a Certificateholder or otherwise.

SECTION 10.04. Servicer's Indemnities.

The Servicer shall defend and indemnify the Trust, the Trustee (including
the Custodian and any other agents of the Trustee) and the Certificateholders
against any and all costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities in
respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Servicer with respect

original Servicer's obligations under this Section 10.04 shall not relate to any
actions of any subsequent Servicer after a Service Transfer) and any payment of
the amount owing under, or any repurchase by the Company of, any such Contract.

THE TRUSTEE
-----------

SECTION 11.01. Duties of Trustee.
----------------- 

The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after
the curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement. If an Event of Termination has occurred (which has not been cured),
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his
own affairs.

The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to the
Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform as to form to the requirements of this Agreement.

Subject to Section 11.03, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed
to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:

a. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, and after the
curing of all such Events of Termination which may have occurred, the duties and
obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions
of this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of
such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee
may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to
the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement;

b. The Trustee shall not be liable for an error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that
the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

c. The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the direction of the Certificateholders with aggregate Percentage Interests
representing 25% or more of the Trust relating to the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Agreement; and

11-1
<PAGE>

d. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any event referred
to in Section 7.01 unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate
Trust Office obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Trustee receives
written notice of such event from the Servicer or the Certificateholders with
aggregate Percentage Interests representing 25% or more of the Trust.

None of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event
require the Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance
of, any of the obligations of the Company or the Servicer under this Agreement,
except during such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and
be vested with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Servicer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Trustee shall not be required
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment
of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

SECTION 11.02. Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.
------------------------------------- 

Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.01:

a. The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any resolution, Officer's Certificate, certificate of a
Servicing Officer, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or
other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties;

b. The Trustee may consult with counsel and any opinion of any counsel
for the Company or the Servicer shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by the Trustee
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

c. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers vested in it by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation hereunder or in relation hereto, at the request, order or direction
of any of the Certificateholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
unless such Certificateholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred therein or thereby; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall relieve the Trustee of the obligations, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Termination (which has not been cured), to exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Agreement, and to use the same degree of care and
skill in their exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs;

d. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after the
curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, the Trustee shall
not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
resolution, 

11-2
<PAGE>

certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless requested in writing so
to do by Certificateholders with aggregate Percentage Interests representing 25%
or more of the Trust; provided, however, that if the payment within a reasonable
time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred
by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not
reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of
this Agreement, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such cost,
expense or liability as a condition to so proceeding. The reasonable expense of
every such examination shall be paid by the Servicer or, if paid by the Trustee,
shall be reimbursed by the Servicer upon demand; and

e. The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or
perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
attorneys or a custodian and shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of
such agents, attorneys or custodians if appointed by it with due care hereunder.

SECTION 11.03. Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Contracts.
------------------------------------------------ 

The Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the recitals
contained herein or in the Certificates (other than the Trustee's execution
thereof). The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Agreement or of the Certificates (other than its execution
thereof) or of any Contract, Contract File or related document. The Trustee
shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Servicer or the
Company of funds paid to the Company in consideration of conveyance of the
Contracts to the Trust by the Company or deposited in or withdrawn from the
Certificate Account by the Servicer.

SECTION 11.04. Trustee May Own Certificates.
---------------------------- 

The Trustee in its individual or other capacity may become the owner or
pledgee of Certificates representing less than all the beneficial interest in
the Trust with the same rights as it would have if it were not Trustee.

SECTION 11.05. Rights of Certificateholders to Direct Trustee and to Waive
-----------------------------------------------------------
Events of Termination.
- - - --------------------- 

Certificateholders with aggregate Percentage Interests representing 25% or
more of the Trust shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee; provided, however, that, subject to
Section 11.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such
direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so
directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a
Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceedings
so directed would be illegal or involve it in personal liability or be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of Certificateholders not parties to such direction;
and provided further that nothing in 

11-3
<PAGE>

this Agreement shall impair the right of the Trustee to take any action deemed
proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction by the
Certificateholders. Certificateholders with aggregate Percentage Interests
representing 51% or more of the Trust may on behalf of Certificateholders waive
any past Event of Termination hereunder and its consequences, except a default
in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Section 12.08 cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of all Certificateholders, and upon any
such waiver, such Event of Termination shall cease to exist and shall be deemed
to have been cured for every purpose of this Agreement; but no such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other Event of Termination or impair any right
consequent thereon.

SECTION 11.06. The Servicer to Pay Trustee's Fees and Expenses.
----------------------------------------------- 

The Servicer agrees:

a. to pay to the Trustee reasonable compensation for all services
rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
trust);

b. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
Trustee, to the extent requested by the Trustee, for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in
accordance with any provision of this Agreement (including the reasonable
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel),
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to
its negligence or bad faith; and

c. to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of this trust and its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of
defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the
exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

The covenants in this Section 11.06 shall be for the benefit of the Trustee
in its capacities as Trustee, Paying Agent and Certificate Registrar hereunder,
and shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.07. Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.
------------------------------------ 

The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a financial institution
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, whose
long-term debt (or, in the case of First Trust National Association, its parent
company) is rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poor's, and shall have a combined
capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or shall be a member of a bank
holding system the aggregate 

11-4
<PAGE>

combined capital and surplus of which is $50,000,000, provided that the
Trustee's separate capital and surplus shall at all times be at least the amount
required by Section 310(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. If
such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or
to the requirements of a supervising or examining authority, then for the
purposes of this Section 11.07, the combined capital and surplus of such Person
shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most
recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall
cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.07,
the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified
in Section 11.08.

SECTION 11.08. Resignation or Removal of Trustee.
--------------------------------- 

The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby
created by giving written notice thereof to the Servicer and the Company. Upon
receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to each of the Servicer and the Company and one
copy to the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so
appointed and shall have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of
such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with
the provisions of Section 11.07 and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Company, or if at any time the Trustee shall be legally unable
to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the
Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take
charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose
of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Company may remove the
Trustee. If the Company shall have removed the Trustee under the authority of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the
successor trustee.

Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 11.08 shall not become
effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided
in Section 11.09.

SECTION 11.09. Successor Trustee.
----------------- 

Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 11.08 shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Servicer, the Company and to its predecessor
Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become effective and
such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor 

11-5
<PAGE>

hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee. The predecessor
Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the successor Trustee the
Contracts and the Contract Files and any related documents and statements held
by it hereunder; and, if the Contracts are then held by a custodian pursuant to
a custodial agreement, the predecessor Trustee and the custodian shall amend
such custodial agreement to make the successor Trustee the successor to the
predecessor Trustee thereunder; and the Servicer, the Company and the
predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other
things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and
confirming in the successor Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and
obligations.

No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section
11.09 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 11.07.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as provided in this
Section 11.09, the Servicer shall cause notice of the succession of such Trustee
hereunder to be mailed to Standard & Poor's and to each Certificateholder at
their addresses as shown in the Certificate Register. If the Servicer fails to
mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at
the expense of the Servicer.

SECTION 11.10. Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.
---------------------------------- 

Any Person into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to
the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the
Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be eligible under the provisions
of Section 11.07, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding. The Trustee shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's in the
event it is a party to any merger, conversion or consolidation.

SECTION 11.11. Tax Returns.
----------- 

Upon the Servicer's request, the Trustee will furnish the Servicer with all
such information as the Servicer may reasonably require in connection with
preparing all tax returns of the Trust and the Trustee shall execute such

<PAGE>

Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses (16 C.F.R. (S) 433) as amended
from time to time:

a. The Trustee is not, and shall not be deemed to be, either in any
individual capacity, as trustee hereunder or otherwise, a creditor, or a
joint venturer with or an Affiliate of, or acting in concert or cooperation
with, any seller of home improvements, in the arrangement, origination or
making of Contracts. The Trustee is the holder of the Contracts only as
trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, and not as a principal or in
any individual or personal capacity;

b. The Trustee shall not be personally liable for or obligated to pay
Obligors any affirmative claims asserted thereby, or responsible to
Certificateholders for any offset defense amounts applied against Contract
payments, pursuant to such legal actions;

c. The Trustee will pay, solely from available Trust monies,
affirmative claims for recovery by Obligors only pursuant to final judicial
orders or judgments, or judicially approved settlement agreements,
resulting from such legal actions;

d. The Trustee will comply with judicial orders and judgments which
require its actions or cooperation in connection with Obligors' legal
actions to recover affirmative claims against Certificateholders;

e. The Trustee will cooperate with and assist Certificateholders in
their defense of legal actions by Obligors to recover affirmative claims if
such cooperation and assistance is not contrary to the interests of the
Trustee as a party to such legal actions and if the Trustee is
satisfactorily indemnified for all liability, costs and expenses arising
therefrom; and

f. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend
the Trustee and Certificateholders from and against any and all liability,
loss, costs and expenses of the Trustee and Certificateholders resulting
from any affirmative claims for recovery asserted or collected by Obligors
under the Contracts. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the obligation of the Company under this Section 11.12(f) shall
not terminate upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VII.

SECTION 11.13. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.
--------------------------------------------- 

Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, for the purpose
of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction having authority over the
Trust, the Contracts or the Obligors, the Company and Trustee acting jointly
shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint
one or more Persons approved by the Trustee to act as co-trustee or co-trustees,
jointly with the Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or
any part of the Trust, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity,
such title to the Trust, or any part thereof, 

11-7
<PAGE>

and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 11.13, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Company and the Trustee may consider
necessary or desirable. If the Company shall not have joined in such appointment
within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request to do so, or in case an
Event of Termination shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone
shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee
hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor
trustee under Section 11.07 hereunder and no notice to Certificateholders of the
appointment of co-trustee(s) or separate trustee(s) shall be required under
Section 11.09 hereof.

In the case of any appointment of a co-trustee or separate trustee pursuant
to this Section 11.13 all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
performed by the Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, except
to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act
or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the
Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations
(including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate
trustee at the direction of the Trustee.

Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed
to have been given to each of the then co-trustees and separate trustees, as
effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any co-
trustee or separate trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of
this Article XI. Each co-trustee and separate trustee, upon its acceptance of
the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in
its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as
may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. Every
such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee.

Any co-trustee or separate trustee may, at any time, constitute the
Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any co-trustee or separate trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor trustee.

SECTION 11.14. Trustee and First Bank System, Inc.
---------------------------------- 

In the event the Trustee ceases to be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
First Bank System, Inc., the Trustee shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's.

a. If the Servicer fails to deposit into the Certificate Account Advances
as required by Section 8.02, then the Trustee shall, subject to the provisions
of paragraph (b) below, from its own funds, deposit into the Certificate Account
the amount not so deposited by the Servicer on or before the Business Day
preceding the related Payment Date (a "Trustee Advance").

b. The Trustee shall not be required to make any Trustee Advance (i) if
and to the extent that it determines in good faith that the funds, if advanced,
would not be recoverable by it from subsequent collections, including Net
Liquidation Proceeds, or (ii) if the Trustee is prohibited by law from making
any such Trustee Advance, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel.

c. The Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement of a Trustee Advance
from subsequent collections on the related Contract, including Net Liquidation
Proceeds, in accordance with Section 8.04(b). If the Trustee determines in good
faith that any Trustee Advance has become an Uncollectible Advance, the Trustee
will be entitled to reimbursement of such Uncollectible Advance from the
Collected Amount.

SECTION 12.01. Servicer Not to Resign.

imposed on it except upon determination that the performance of its duties
hereunder is no longer permissible under applicable law. Any such determination
permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel for the Servicer to such effect delivered to the Trustee. No such
resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or a successor servicer

Certificates and this Agreement may be served. On the date hereof the Trustee's
office for such purposes is located at 180 East 5th Street, Third Floor, St.

Principal and Monthly Interest due to Certificateholders pursuant to Sections
8.01 and 8.04) on the earlier of (a) the Payment Date on which the Principal
Balance is reduced to zero; or (b) the Payment Date on which the Servicer
repurchases the Contracts pursuant to Section 8.08; provided, that in no event
shall the trust created hereby continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from
the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late
Ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James, living on the date
hereof, and provided, further, that the Servicer's and the Company's
representations and warranties and indemnities by the Company and the Servicer
shall survive termination.

<PAGE>

b. Notice of any termination, specifying the Final Payment Date (which
shall be a date that would otherwise be a Payment Date) upon which all
Certificateholders may surrender their Certificates to the Servicer for payment
of the final distribution and cancellation, shall be given promptly by the
Trustee (upon direction by the Servicer ten days prior to the date such notice
is to be mailed) by letter to Standard & Poor's and to Certificateholders mailed
no later than the fifth Business Day of the month of the Final Payment Date
specifying (1) the Final Payment Date upon which final payment on the
Certificates will be made upon presentation and surrender of Certificates at the
office or agency of the Servicer therein designated; (2) the amount of any such
final payment; and (3) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Payment
Date is not applicable, payments being made only upon presentation and surrender
of the Certificates at the office or agency of the Servicer therein specified.
The Trustee shall give such notice to the Certificate Registrar at the time such
notice is given to the Certificateholders. In the event such notice is given in
connection with the Servicer's election to purchase the Contracts, the Servicer
shall deposit in the Certificate Account on the Final Payment Date in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the above-described purchase
price and upon such deposit Certificateholders will be entitled to the amount of
such purchase price but not amounts in excess thereof, all as provided herein.
Upon certification to the Trustee by a Servicing Officer, following such final
deposit the Trustee shall promptly release to the Servicer the Contract Files
for the remaining Contracts, and the Trustee shall execute all assignments,
endorsements and other instruments necessary to effectuate such transfer.

c. Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee shall
cause to be distributed to Certificateholders on the Final Payment Date in
proportion to their respective Percentage Interests, to the extent of Amount
Available, an amount equal to Monthly Interest and Monthly Principal. The
distribution on the Final Payment Date pursuant to this Section 12.04 shall be
in lieu of the distribution otherwise required to be made on such Payment Date
in respect of the Certificates.

d. In the event that all of the Certificateholders do not surrender their
Certificates for cancellation within three months after the time specified in
the above-mentioned written notice, the Company shall give a second written
notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for
cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within
three months after the second notice all the Certificates shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, the Company shall transfer to itself all amounts
remaining on deposit in the Certificate Account, to hold in trust for
Certificateholders who have not surrendered their Certificates for cancellation,
together with the final record list of Certificateholders, and the Company shall
take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to
contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of their
Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other
assets which remain in trust hereunder.

---------------------------

a. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, whenever
Certificateholder approval, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver,
or other action is required hereunder, such approval, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be deemed to have been given or
taken on behalf of, and shall be binding upon, all Certificateholders if agreed
to by Certificateholders with aggregate Percentage Interests representing 51% or
more of the Trust.

b. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by

of substantially similar tenor signed by such Certificateholders in person or by
agent duly appointed in writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly
provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments
are delivered to the Trustee and, where required, to the Servicer. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall
be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and (subject to Section 11.01)
conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Servicer and the Company if made in the
manner provided in this Section.

or other act by a Certificateholder shall bind every holder of every Certificate
issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in
lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, or omitted to be done by the Trustee,
the Servicer or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Certificates.

to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.

as Servicer which are dealt with under Article V and Article VII, the Company
may not convey and assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder

Interests representing 66-2/3% or more of the Trust, and any attempt to do so
without such consent shall be void.

SECTION 12.08. Amendment.
----------

a. This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Company, the
Servicer and the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Certificateholders
to correct manifest error, to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any
provisions herein or therein which may be inconsistent with any other provisions
herein or therein, as the case may be; provided, however, that such action shall
not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel for the Company, adversely affect in
any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder.

the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of Certificateholders with
aggregate Percentage Interests representing 66-2/3% or more of the Trust, for

Trust; provided, however, that no such amendment or waiver shall (a) reduce in
any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, collections of payments on the
Contracts or distributions which are required to be made on any Certificate, or

without the consent of the holders of all Certificates then outstanding or
(c) cause any tax to be imposed on the Trust.

c. This Agreement shall not be amended under this Section without the
consent of 100% of Certificateholders if such amendment would result in the
disqualification of the Trust as a Grantor Trust under the Code.

d. Concurrently with the solicitation of any consent pursuant to this
Section 12.08, the Trustee shall furnish written notification to Standard &
Poor's of such solicitation. Promptly after the execution of any amendment or
consent pursuant to this Section 12.08, the Trustee shall furnish written
notification of the substance of such amendment to Standard & Poor's and each
Certificateholder.

e. It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders under
this Section 12.08 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but
it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The
manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the
execution

12-4

thereof by Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable requirements
as the Trustee may prescribe.

f. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such
amendment which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under

Section, in connection with any amendment pursuant to this Section, the Trustee
shall have received an unqualified Opinion of Counsel, the expense of which
shall not be an expense of the Trust, stating that any such amendment will not
adversely affect the status of the Trust as a Grantor Trust.

above in Home Improvement Loan Trust 1994-CII (the "Trust"), which includes
among its assets a pool of home improvement installment sales contracts and
promissory notes (and any and all rights to receive payments which are due
pursuant thereto on or after September 1, 1994) and the Limited Guaranty. The
Trust has been created pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the
"Agreement"), dated as of September 1, 1994, between Green Tree Financial
Corporation, as Seller and Servicer (the "Company"), and First Trust National
Association, as Trustee of the Trust (the "Trustee"). This Certificate is one of
the Certificates described in the Agreement and is issued pursuant and subject
to the Agreement. By acceptance of this Certificate the holder assents to and
becomes bound by the Agreement. To the extent not defined herein, all
capitalized terms have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.

The Agreement contemplates, subject to its terms, payment on the fifteenth day
(or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) (the
"Payment Date") of each calendar month commencing October 17, 1994, so long as
the Agreement has not been terminated, by check (or, if such Certificateholder
holds Certificates with an aggregate Percentage Interest of at least 5% and so
desires, by wire transfer pursuant to instructions delivered to the Trustee at
least 10 days prior to such Payment Date) from funds drawn from the Certificate
Account to the registered Certificateholder at the address appearing on the
Certificate Register as of the Business Day immediately preceding such Payment
Date, an amount equal to the Certificateholder's Percentage Interest of Monthly
Principal and Monthly Interest. The final scheduled Payment Date of this
Certificate is October 15, 1994 or the next succeeding Business Day if such
October 15 is not a Business Day.

The Certificateholder, by its acceptance of this Certificate, agrees that it
will look solely to the funds in the Certificate Account and the Limited
Guaranty of the Company, to the extent available for distribution to the
Certificateholder as provided in the Agreement for payment hereunder and that
the Trustee in its individual capacity is not personally liable to the
Certificateholder for any amounts payable under this Certificate or the
Agreement or, except as expressly provided in the Agreement, subject to any
liability under the Agreement. By acceptance of this Certificate, the
Certificateholder agrees to disclosure of his, her or its name and address to
other Certificateholders under the conditions specified in the Agreement.

No transfer of a Certificate by, on behalf of or with plan assets of any
employee benefit plan, trust or account that is subject to the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or that is
described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code (each, a "Plan") will be registered
unless the transferee, at its expense, delivers to the Trustee, the Servicer and
the Company an opinion of counsel (satisfactory to the Trustee, the Servicer and
the Company) that the purchase and holding of a Certificate by, on behalf of, or
with Plan assets of such Plan is permissible under applicable law, will not
result in the assets of the Trust being deemed to be Plan assets and subject to
the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and will not subject
the Trustee, the Trust, the Company or the Servicer to any obligation or
liability in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement. Unless such
opinion is delivered, each person acquiring this Certificate 

A-2
<PAGE>

will be deemed to represent to the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer that
such person is neither a Plan, nor acting on behalf of a Plan, nor purchasing
with Plan assets of any Plan.

This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Agreement and reference is
made to the Agreement for information with respect to the interests, rights,
benefits, obligations, proceeds and duties evidenced hereby and the rights,
duties and immunities of the Trustee. Copies of the Agreement and all
amendments thereto will be provided to any Certificateholder free of charge upon
a written request to the Trustee.

As provided in the Agreement and subject to the limitations set forth therein,
the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate Register of
the Certificate Registrar upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the office or agency maintained by the Trustee in Minneapolis or St.
Paul, Minnesota, accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the
holder thereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon
one or more new Certificates evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Company, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of the Company, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent or the Certificate Registrar may treat the person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the
Company, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Registrar
nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

EXHIBIT D

FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

The opinion of Dorsey & Whitney shall be to the effect that (capitalized
terms have the meanings set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement):

1. Green Tree is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota, with corporate power to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement and the Certificates. Green Tree is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the performance of its duties under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement and the Certificates would
require such qualification.

2. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement
have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action, duly executed and
delivered by Green Tree, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of
Green Tree enforceable in accordance with their terms. The Certificates have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action and, when duly and
validly executed by the Trustee in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, will be validly issued and outstanding and entitled to the benefits
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated is now the registered owner of the Certificates and, assuming that
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated purchased the Certificates
for value in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim, Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated has acquired all the rights of Green Tree in
the Certificates free of any adverse claim.

3. No consent, approval, authorization or order of any state or federal
court or governmental agency or body is required to be obtained by Green Tree
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement except such as may be
required under blue sky laws under any jurisdiction in connection with the
offering of the Certificates by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.

4. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement is not required to be qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as now in effect, and the Trust is not
required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

5. Neither the transfer of the Contracts to the Trustee, nor the issuance
or sale of the Certificates, nor the execution and delivery of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement or the Underwriting Agreement, nor the consummation of any
other of 

D-1
<PAGE>

the transactions contemplated in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the
Underwriting Agreement, or the consummation of any other of the transactions
contemplated in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the Underwriting
Agreement, nor the fulfillment of the terms of the Certificates, the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement or the Underwriting Agreement by Green Tree will conflict
with, or result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or constitute a
default under, any term or provision of the Restated Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws of Green Tree or of any indenture or other agreement or instrument
known to us to which Green Tree is a party or by which it is bound, or result in
a violation of, or contravene the terms of any statute, order or regulation,
applicable to Green Tree, of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency
or governmental body having jurisdiction over it.

6. There are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the best of our
knowledge, actions, proceedings or investigations pending or overtly threatened
against Green Tree before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal
(A) asserting the invalidity of the Underwriting Agreement, the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Certificates, the hazard or flood insurance policies
applicable to any Contracts or the Errors and Omissions Protection Policy,
(B) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates or the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (C) which is likely materially and adversely to
affect the performance by Green Tree of its obligations under, or the validity
or enforceability of, the Underwriting Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement or the Certificates or (D) seeking adversely to affect the federal
income tax attributes of the Certificates described in the Prospectus and the
Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Certain Federal Income Tax
Consequences."

7. Green Tree is duly registered as a finance company in each state in
which Contracts were originated, to the extent such registration is required by
applicable law.

8. The transfer of the Contracts to the Trust in accordance with Section
2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement would not be avoidable as a
preferential transfer under Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11
U.S.C. (S) 547), as in effect on the date hereof, in the event that Green Tree
became a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

9. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement Green Tree has
transferred to the Trustee acting on behalf of the Trust all of Green Tree's
right, title and interest in the Contracts, free and clear of any and all other
assignments, encumbrances, options, rights, claims, liens or security interests
(except tax or possessory liens) that may affect the right of the Trustee in and
to such Contracts, and has delivered the Contract Files to the Trustee or its
custodian. No filing or other action, other than the filing of a financing
statement on Form UCC-1 with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota
identifying the Contracts as collateral and naming Green Tree as debtor and the
Trust as secured party, and the filing of continuation statements as required by
Section 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing 

D-2
<PAGE>

Agreement, is necessary to perfect as against third parties the assignment of
the Contracts by Green Tree to the Trust. We have separately provided you with
our opinion concerning whether such assignment could be recharacterized as a
pledge rather than a sale in the event Green Tree became a debtor under the
United States Bankruptcy Code. However, in the event such assignment were
characterized as a pledge securing a loan from the Certificateholders to Green
Tree, it is our opinion that the Trustee would be deemed to have a valid and
perfected first priority security interest in the Contracts and the proceeds
thereof, which security interest would be prior to any other security interest
that may be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the
State of Minnesota and over any "lien creditor" (as defined in Minn. Stat.
(S)336.9-301(3)) who becomes such after the Closing Date, except that a
subsequent purchaser of any Contract who gives new value and takes possession
thereof in the ordinary course of his business would have priority over the
Trustee's security interest in such Contract, if such purchaser acts without
knowledge that such Contract was subject to a security interest. We have assumed
for the purposes of this opinion that during the term of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement the Trustee, or its custodian, shall maintain possession of
the Contract Files for the purpose of perfecting the assignment to the Trustee
of the Contracts. We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of
any individual Contract or the existence of any claims, rights or other matters
in favor of any Obligor or the owner of any financed home improvement.

10. For federal income tax purposes, the Trust created pursuant to the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement will be treated as a grantor trust under Subpart
E, Part I, of Subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and not as an association taxable as a corporation under the Code, and
under Section 671 of the Code, each Certificateholder will be treated as the
owner of an undivided pro rata interest in each of the Contracts in the Trust.

11. The transfer of the Contracts and the proceeds thereof by Green Tree
to the Trustee on the date hereof pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement would not be avoidable as fraudulent transfers under the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act as in effect in Minnesota on the date hereof (Minn.
Stat. (S)(S) 513.41 through 513.51), nor, should Green Tree become a debtor
under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as fraudulent transfers under Section
548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. (S) 548) as in effect on the
date hereof.
