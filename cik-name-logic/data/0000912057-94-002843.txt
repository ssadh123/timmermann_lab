DUKE ASSOCIATES

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

(1) ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF COMBINATION

The accompanying combined financial statements of Duke Associates
include the operating businesses, commercial rental properties and undeveloped
land which are expected to be acquired by Duke Realty Investments, Inc.
(the "Company"). Duke Associates represents substantially all of the real
estate properties and operating businesses under common control of the current
Duke Associates owners which are engaged in the ownership, leasing, management,
construction and development businesses of commercial real estate in the
Midwest.

The financial statements of Duke Associates have been presented on the
combined basis because of the common ownership and management of the related
properties and operating businesses. After the aforementioned acquisition, the
properties and operating businesses will be majority owned and controlled by the
Company through its subsidiaries to be formed and known as Duke Realty Limited
Partnership and Duke Services, Inc. The equity method of accounting is used for
investments in non-majority owned partnerships and joint ventures in which Duke
Associates has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies. The cost method of accounting is used for two non-majority
owned joint ventures over which Duke Associates does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence, and the differences between the cost method and
the equity method of accounting for these joint ventures does not significantly
affect the financial position or results of operations.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in the combined financial statements.

The combined financial statements as of September 30, 1993 and for the
nine months then ended are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a
fair presentation of the combined financial statements for this interim period
have been included. The results for the interim period ended September 30, 1993
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for the full fiscal
year.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUES

All leases are classified as operating leases and rental income is
recognized on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.

Management fees are based on a percentage of rental receipts of properties
managed and are recognized as the rental receipts are collected.

Leasing fees are based on the gross value of leases signed and are
recognized as earned under the terms of the various contracts.

Maintenance fees are recognized as the services are performed based upon
established hourly rates.

Construction management fees are generally based on a fixed percentage of
costs and are recognized as the project costs are incurred.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)
(UNAUDITED)

Development fees are generally based on a percentage of total project costs of
properties developed and are recognized throughout the development process of
the related properties.

FINANCING AND LEASING COSTS

Costs incurred in connection with financing or leasing are amortized on a
straight-line method over the term of the related loan or lease. Unamortized
leasing costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the lease.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are not provided in the accompanying combined financial
statements because the entities that own the properties and the operating
businesses are either partnerships or S corporations and the taxable income or
loss is included in the income tax returns of the individual partners or
shareholders.
