giving effect to payroll savings.

GPU SUBSIDIARIES OFFER VOLUNTARY ENHANCED RETIREMENT PLAN 

Parsippany, N.J., April 12, 1994 -- General Public Utilities

Corporation (NYSE:GPU) said today that its subsidiaries are

offering nearly 800 of their 5,700 non-bargaining employees a

voluntary enhanced retirement program.

The GPU companies plan to discuss possible participation by

their 6,100 bargaining unit employees in a similar enhanced

retirement program.

Depending on the results of discussions with the bargaining

unit leadership and any negotiations that might follow, up to an

additional 600 to 700 employees from the bargaining units could

be eligible for a voluntary enhanced retirement program, assuming

similar eligibility parameters.

If two-thirds of the anticipated eligible non-bargaining and

bargaining unit employees accept the program, the net impact on

1994 earnings would be approximately 55 to 60 cents per share,

after giving effect to payroll savings. That figure could

change, depending on changes in eligibility and acceptance rates.

The voluntary enhanced retirement program is part of a

corporate realignment that GPU announced February 14. At that

time, the company said that its goal was to achieve $80 million

in annual cost savings by the end of 1996.

"We are taking these measures to prepare the GPU System for

the increased competition in the electric utility industry," said

James R. Leva, GPU chairman, president and chief executive

officer. 

"Our hope is to meet the work force requirements of our new

organization with this program and attrition, but additional

reductions are possible. Clearly, the GPU work force of the

future will be smaller than it is today," Leva added.

The voluntary enhanced retirement program is open to

employees who are at least 55 years old and have at least five

years of service by July 31. The plan will add five years to an

eligible employee's years of service and age. 

In addition, the company will raise the annual pension

maximum from 55 to 60 percent of final three-year average

earnings, pay a $500 monthly Social Security supplement until age

62, and waive required health care premium cost sharing for

certain employees. Eligible employees will generally have from

May 2 to June 16 to decide whether to accept the plan. Retire-

ments will generally take effect July 31.

Eligible non-bargaining unit employees are employed at the

following GPU subsidiaries: Metropolitan Edison Company, Pennsyl-

vania Electric Company, Jersey Central Power and Light Company,

GPU Nuclear Corporation and GPU Service Corporation.
