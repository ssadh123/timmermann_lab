Item 5. Other Events
- ---------------------

New England Power Company (NEP), a subsidiary of New England
Electric System, has been sued by Milford Power Limited
Partnership (MPLP) in the Superior Court for Worcester County,
Massachusetts. MPLP, a venture formed by Enron Corporation, owns
a 149 MW gas-fired power plant in Milford, Massachusetts. NEP
purchases 56% of the power output of the facility under a long-
term contract with MPLP. The suit alleges that NEP has engaged
in a scheme to cause MPLP and its power plant to fail and has
prevented MPLP from finding a long-term buyer for the remaining
44% of the facility's output. The complaint includes allegations
that NEP has violated the Federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, engaged in unfair or deceptive acts in
trade or commerce, and breached contracts. MPLP seeks
compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, as well as treble
damages. NEP believes that the allegations of wrongdoing are
without merit.
