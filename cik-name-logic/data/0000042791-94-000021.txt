ITEM 2. Transfer of Control

Goulds Pumps, Inc. (Goulds) and Franklin Electric Co.,
Inc. (Franklin) announced that control of Oil Dynamics,
Inc. transferred to Franklin on November 28, 1994. 
Previously, Oil Dynamics was owned and controlled equally
by Goulds and Franklin.

The change in control results from Goulds' election to
receive a cash dividend in the amount of $11.7 million in
lieu of a stock dividend declared by Oil Dynamics. After
the cash and stock dividends have been paid, Goulds will
continue to own 3% of Oil Dynamics voting stock. 
Franklin elected to take the stock dividend which will
increase its interest in Oil Dynamics to 97%.

Future results of Oil Dynamics will be consolidated into
Franklin and Goulds' interest in Oil Dynamics will no
longer be recorded under the "equity" method of
accounting. There will be no gain or loss on the
transaction for either Goulds or Franklin.

Goulds believes the transfer of control will allow it to
better focus its resources on those businesses more
closely aligned to its strategic plan. 

Oil Dynamics, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is a producer
of deep-well petroleum pumps used in the oil industry. 
It was established in 1967 under the joint control of
Goulds and Franklin. Franklin is the primary supplier of
motors for Goulds' domestic water systems pumps.

ITEM 7. Financial Statements and Pro Forma Financial Information
and Exhibits

b.PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
GOULDS PUMPS, INC.

The following pro forma condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of September 30, 1994, and the pro
forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings
for the nine month period then ended and the year
ended December 31, 1993 give effect to the transfer
of control of Oil Dynamics, Inc. The adjustments
related to the pro forma condensed consolidated
balance sheet assume the transaction was
consummated at September 30, 1994, while the
adjustments to the pro forma condensed consolidated
statements of earnings assume the transaction was
consummated at the beginning of the period
presented. The transfer occurred on November 28,
1994.

The pro forma information is based on the
historical financial statements of Goulds ("GPI")
with only pro forma adjustments required to reduce
"Investments in Affiliates" on the condensed
consolidated balance sheet and "Earnings from
Affiliates" on the consolidated statements of
earnings and to reflect the associated net interest
earnings and income tax effects of the transaction.

These pro forma statements are not necessarily
indicative of the results that actually would have
occurred if the transfer had been in effect as of
and for the periods presented or what may be
achieved in the future.
