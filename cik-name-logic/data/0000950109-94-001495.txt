to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, by execution of an assignment
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, (1) all the right, title and
interest of the Company in and to the Contracts, including, without limitation,
the security interests created thereby and any related Mortgages and all
interest and principal received by the Company on or with respect to the

Cut-off Date, or the date of origination, if later), (2) all rights under every
Hazard Insurance Policy relating to a Manufactured Home securing a Contract for
the benefit of the creditor of such Contract, (3) all rights under all FHA/VA

result in the receipt by the Trust of any "income from nonpermitted assets,"
within the meaning of Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

covered thereby as security for payment of the Cut-off Date Principal
Balance of such Contract. The Company has assigned all of its right, title
and interest in such Contract, including the security interest in the
Manufactured Home covered thereby, to the Trustee. The Trustee has and will
have a valid and perfected and enforceable first priority security interest
in such Contract and Manufactured Home.

Each Mortgage is a valid first lien in favor of the Company on real 
property securing the amount owed by the Obligor under the related Land-

3-3
<PAGE>

and-Home Contract subject only to (a) the lien of current real property
taxes and assessments, (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights
of way, easements and other matters of public record as of the date of
recording of such Mortgage, such exceptions appearing of record being
acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally in the area wherein
the property subject to the Mortgage is located or specifically reflected
in the appraisal obtained in connection with the origination of the related
Land-and-Home Contract obtained by the Company and (c) other matters to
which like properties are commonly subject which do not materially
interfere with the benefits of the security intended to be provided by such
Mortgage. The Company has assigned all of its right, title and interest in
such Land-and-Home Contract and related Mortgage, including the security
interest in the Manufactured Home covered thereby, to the Trustee. The
Trustee has and will have a valid and perfected and enforceable first
priority security interest in such Land-and-Home Contract.

l. Capacity of Parties. The signature(s) of the Obligor(s) on the
------------------- 
Contract are genuine and all parties to the Contract had full legal 
capacity to execute the Contract.

m. Good Title. In the case of a Contract purchased from a 
---------- 
manufactured housing dealer, the Company purchased the Contract for fair
value and took possession thereof in the ordinary course of its business,
without knowledge that the Contract was subject to a security interest. The
Company has not sold, assigned or pledged the Contract to any person and
prior to the transfer of the Contract by the Company to the Trustee, the
Company had good and marketable title thereto free and clear of any
encumbrance, equity, loan, pledge, charge, claim or security interest and
was the sole owner thereof with full right to transfer the Contract to the
Trustee.

n. No Defaults. As of the Cut-off Date (or the date of origination,
----------- 
if later), there was no default, breach, violation or event permitting
acceleration existing under the Contract and no event which, with notice
and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute such a
default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration under such
Contract (except payment delinquencies permitted by clause (b) above). The
Company has not waived any such default, breach, violation or event
permitting acceleration except payment delinquencies permitted by clause
(b) above. As of the Closing Date, the related Manufactured Home is, to the
best of the Company's knowledge, free of damage and in good repair. No
Manufactured Home has suffered hurricane or earthquake damage that is not
covered by a Hazard Insurance Policy.

o. No Liens. As of the Closing Date there are, to the best of the
-------- 
Company's knowledge, no liens or claims which have been filed for work,
labor or materials affecting the Manufactured Home or any related Mortgaged

3-4
<PAGE>

Property securing the Contract which are or may be liens prior to, or equal
or coordinate with, the lien of the Contract.

p. Equal Installments. Each Contract has a fixed Contract Rate and
------------------ 
provides for level monthly payments which fully amortize the loan over 
its term.

q. Enforceability. The Contract contains customary and enforceable
-------------- 
provisions so as to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof
adequate for the realization against the collateral of the benefits of the
security provided thereby.

r. One Original. There is only one original executed Contract, 
------------ 
which Contract has been delivered to the Trustee or its custodian on or
before the Closing Date. Each Contract (other then the Land-and-Home
Contracts) has been stamped to reflect the assignment of such Contract to
the Trustee.

s. Loan-to-Value Ratio. At the time of their origination all but 
------------------- 
134 Contracts had Loan-to-Value Ratios not greater than 95%; if the related
Manufactured Home was new at the time such Contract was originated, the
original principal balance of such Contract did not exceed 125% of the
manufacturer's invoice price plus 100% of the taxes and license fees, 100%
of the freight charges, 100% of the dealer's cost of additional dealer-
installed equipment (not to exceed 20% of the original principal balance of
such Contract in all states except California; not to exceed 70% of the
manufacturer's invoice price in California if required to meet park
requirements) and up to $750 of set-up costs per module.

t. Primary Resident. At the time of origination of the Contract the
---------------- 
Obligor was the primary resident of the related Manufactured Home.

u. Not Real Estate. With respect to each Contract other than a 
--------------- 
Land-and-Home Contract, the related Manufactured Home is not considered or
classified as part of the real estate on which it is located under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is located.

v. Notation of Security Interest. With respect to each Contract 
----------------------------- 
other than a Land-and-Home Contract, if the related Manufactured Home is
located in a state in which notation of a security interest on the title
document is required or permitted to perfect such security interest, the
title document shows, or if a new or replacement title document with
respect to such Manufactured Home is being applied for such title document
will be issued within 180 days and will show, the Company as the holder of
a first priority security interest in such Manufactured Home; if the
related Manufactured Home is located in a state in which the filing of a
financing statement under the UCC is required to perfect a security
interest in 

3-5
<PAGE>

manufactured housing, such filings or recordings have been duly made and
show the Company as secured party. If the related Manufactured Home secures
a Land-and-Home Contract, such Manufactured Home is subject to a Mortgage
properly filed in the appropriate public recording office or such Mortgage
will be properly filed in the appropriate public recording office within
180 days, naming the Company as mortgagee. In either case, the Trustee has
the same rights as the secured party of record would have (if such secured
party were still the owner of the Contract) against all Persons (including
the Company and any trustee in bankruptcy of the Company) claiming an
interest in such Manufactured Home.

w. Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act. The related 
----------------------------------------- 
Manufactured Home is a "manufactured home" within the meaning of 42 United
States Code, Section 5402(6). Each manufactured housing dealer from whom
the Company purchased such Contract, if any, was then approved by the
Company in accordance with the requirements of the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development set forth in 24 CFR (S) 201.27. At the origination of
each Contract, the Company was approved for insurance by the Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development pursuant to Section 2 of the National Housing
Act.

x. Qualified Mortgage. The Contract represents a "qualified 
------------------ 
mortgage" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code. The Company
represents and warrants that, either as of the date of origination or the
Closing Date, the fair market value of the property securing each Contract
was not less than 80% of the "adjusted issue price" (within the meaning of
the REMIC Provisions) of such Contract.

SECTION 3.03. Representations and Warranties Regarding the Contracts in
---------------------------------------------------------
the Aggregate.
- - ------------- 

The Company represents and warrants to the Trustee and the Certificate-
holders that:

a. Amounts. The aggregate principal amounts payable by Obligors 
------- 
under the Contracts as of the Cut-off Date (assuming all Staged-Funding

Balance.

b. Characteristics. The Contracts have the following 
--------------- 
characteristics as of the Cut-off Date (or the date of origination, if
later): (i) the Obligors on not more than 10% of the Contracts by Cut-off

respect to Contracts with Obligors located in Texas), the Obligors on not
more than 5% of the Contracts by remaining principal balance are located in
an area with the same zip code and the Obligors on not more than 1% of the
Contracts by remaining principal balance are located in California in an
area with the same zip code; (ii) no Contract 

3-6

Pool Principal Balance is attributable to loans for purchases of new
Manufactured Homes and approximately 16% is attributable to loans for
purchases of used Manufactured Homes; and (v) no Contract was originated
before March 1982.

c. Staged-Funding Contracts. Approximately $37,743,334 of the 
------------------------ 
Contracts, by Cut-off Date Principal Balance, are Staged-Funding Contracts
that had not been fully disbursed by the Cut-off Date. Approximately
$29,526,081 of such amount had been disbursed by the Closing Date, and
approximately $8,217,253 remained to be disbursed on or before the Funding
Termination Date.

d. Computer Tape. The Computer Tape made available by the Company
------------- 
was complete and accurate as of its date and includes a description of the
same Contracts that are described in the List of Contracts.

e. Marking Records. By the Closing Date, the Company has caused the
--------------- 
portions of the Electronic Ledger relating to the Contracts to be clearly
and unambiguously marked to indicate that such Contracts constitute part of
the Trust and are owned by the Trust in accordance with the terms of the
trust created hereunder.

f. No Adverse Selection. Except for the effect of the 
-------------------- 
representations and warranties made in Sections 3.02 and 3.03 hereof, no
adverse selection procedures have been employed in selecting the Contracts.

SECTION 3.04. Representations and Warranties Regarding the Contract 
-----------------------------------------------------
Files.
- - -----

The Company represents and warrants to the Trustee and the Certificate-
holders that:

a. Possession. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company
---------- 
will have possession of each original Contract and the related Contract
File or Land-and-Home Contract File and there are and there will be no
custodial agreements in effect materially and adversely affecting the
rights of the Company to make, or cause to be made, any delivery required
hereunder.

b. Bulk Transfer Laws. The transfer, assignment and conveyance of

SECTION 3.05. Repurchase of Contracts or Substitution of Contracts for
--------------------------------------------------------
Breach of Representations and Warranties.
- - ---------------------------------------- 

a. The Company shall repurchase a Contract, at its Repurchase Price, not
later than the last day of the Due Period prior to the Due Period that is 90
days after the day on which the Company, the Servicer or the Trustee first
discovers or should have discovered a breach of a representation or warranty of
the Company set forth in Sections 2.02(m), 3.02, 3.03 or 3.04 of this Agreement
that materially adversely affects the Trust's or the Certificateholders'
interest in such Contract and which breach has not been cured; provided,
-------- 
however, that (i) in the event that a party other than the Company first becomes
- - ------- 
aware of such breach, such discovering party shall notify the Company in writing
within five Business Days of the date of such discovery and (ii) with respect to
any Contract incorrectly described on the List of Contracts with respect to
unpaid principal balance, which the Company would otherwise be required to
repurchase pursuant to this Section, the Company may, in lieu of repurchasing
such Contract, deposit in the Certificate Account no later than the first
Determination Date that is 90 or more days from the date of such discovery cash
in an amount sufficient to cure such deficiency or discrepancy. Any such cash so
deposited shall be distributed to Certificateholders and Class C
Certificateholders on the immediately following Remittance Date as a collection
of principal or interest on such Contract, according to the nature of the
deficiency or discrepancy. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the obligation of the Company under this Section shall not terminate
upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VII.

b. On or prior to the date that is the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Company, at its election, may substitute an Eligible Substitute
Contract for a Contract that it is obligated to repurchase pursuant to Section
3.05(a) (such Contract being referred to as the "Replaced Contract") upon
satisfaction of the following conditions:

(i) the Company shall have conveyed to the Trustee the Contract 
to be substituted for the Replaced Contract and the Contract File related
to such Contract and the Company shall have marked the Electronic Ledger
indicating that such Contract constitutes part of the Trust;

(ii) the Contract to be substituted for the Replaced Contract is 
an Eligible Substitute Contract and the Company delivers an Officers'
Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit J-2 hereto, to the
Trustee certifying that such Contract is an Eligible Substitute Contract;

(iii) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee evidence of
filing of a UCC-1 financing statement executed by the Company as debtor,
naming the Trustee as secured party and filed in Minnesota, listing such
Contract as collateral;

3-8
<PAGE>

(iv) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel (a) to the effect that the substitution of such Contract for such
Replaced Contract will not cause the Trust to fail to qualify as a REMIC at
any time under then applicable REMIC Provisions or cause any "prohibited
transaction" that will result in the imposition of a tax under such REMIC
Provisions and (b) to the effect of paragraph 9 of Exhibit E hereto; and

(v) if the Scheduled Principal Balance of such Replaced Contract 
is greater than the Scheduled Principal Balance of the Contract being
substituted, the Company shall have deposited in the Certificate Account
the amount of such excess and shall have included in the Officers'
Certificate required by clause (ii) above a certification that such deposit
has been made.

Upon satisfaction of such conditions, the Trustee shall add such Contract to,
and delete such Replaced Contract from, the List of Contracts. Such substitution
shall be effected prior to the first Determination Date that occurs more than 90
days after the Company becomes aware, or should have become aware, or receives
written notice from the Trustee, of the breach referred to in Section 3.05(a).
Promptly after any substitution of a Contract, the Company shall give written
notice of such substitution to Moody's and Fitch.

c. (i) On the Funding Termination Date, the Company shall deliver an
Officer's Certificate to the Trustee, stating that each Staged-Funding Contract
was fully disbursed in accordance with the terms of such Contract on or before
the Funding Termination Date, or specifying any Staged-Funding Contracts which
were not fully disbursed by the Funding Termination Date (each Staged-Funding
Contract that was not so fully disbursed being hereinafter referred to as an
"Unfunded Contract"), and the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of each Unfunded
Contract.

(ii) On or before the Funding Termination Date, the Company shall 
either repurchase any Unfunded Contract in accordance with Section 3.05(a), or
shall substitute an Eligible Substitute Contract for such Unfunded Contract in
accordance with Section 3.05(b). With respect o the repurchase of an Unfunded
Contract pursuant to this Section 3.05(c), an amount of the Repurchase Price
equal to the Unfunded Contract Shortfall attributable to such Unfunded Contract
shall be treated as a refund to the Trust of the purchase price paid by the
Trust for additional obligations of the Obligor on such Contract under Section
2.01(c), and the remainder of the Repurchase Price shall be treated as paid to
the Trust for such Unfunded Contract.

(iii) If the Company shall have failed to repurchase an Unfunded
Contract or to substitute an Eligible Substitute Contract therefor in accordance
with subsection (ii) above, then the disbursed principal balance of such
Unfunded Contract as owned by the Trust shall not be increased after the Funding
Termination Date, notwithstanding any further disbursements that may be made to
the related Obligor by the Company after the Funding Termination Date. The
Servicer shall 

3-9
<PAGE>

thereafter allocate principal and interest collected on the Contract between the
Trust and the Company on a pro rata basis in accordance with the disbursed
principal balance as of the Funding Termination Date, with the result that
payments of interest and principal collected with respect to such disbursed
principal balance as of the Funding Termination Date shall be collected to the
Trust. The aggregate differential between the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of
all such Unfunded Contracts as specified in the List of Contracts and the
disbursed principal balance of such Unfunded Contracts as of the Funding
Termination Date (the "Unfunded Contract Shortfall") shall be added to the
Formula Principal Distribution Amount with respect to the Remittance Date in
November 1994.

(iv) On the Business Day prior to each Remittance Date until and 
including the Remittance Date in November 1994, the Company shall pay any Class
A Interest Shortfall or Class B-1 Interest Shortfall occurring on such
Remittance Date, if and to the extent such shortfall is caused by the difference
between (A) the interest that would have been payable on all Staged-Funding
Contracts in the related Due Period had such Contracts been fully disbursed on
the Closing Date and (B) the interest actually payable on such Contracts in the
related Due Period according to the terms of such Contracts.

(v) To further evidence its obligation to repurchase Unfunded 
Contracts pursuant to subsection (ii) above and to deposit any Class A Interest
Shortfall and Class B-1 Interest Shortfall pursuant to subsection (iv) above,
the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, on the Closing Date, a demand note in
an amount no less than the aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balances of the
Staged-Funding Contracts.

d. Upon receipt by the Trust by deposit in the Certificate Account of the
Repurchase Price under subsection (a) or (c) above, or the delivery of an
Eligible Substitute Contract pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) above, and upon
receipt of a certificate of a Servicing Officer in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit J-1 or J-2, the Trustee shall convey and assign to the Company all of
the Certificateholders' and Class C Certificateholders' right, title and
interest in the repurchased Contract or Replaced Contract without recourse,
representation or warranty, except as to the absence of liens, charges or
encumbrances created by or arising as a result of actions of the Trustee.

e. The Company shall defend and indemnify the Trustee, the Certificate-
holders and the Class C Certificateholders against all costs, expenses, losses,
damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, arising out of any claims which may be asserted against or incurred by
any of them as a result of any third-party action arising out of any breach of
any such representation and warranty.

SECTION 3.06. No Repurchase or Substitution Under Certain 
------------------------------------------- 
Circumstances.
- - -------------

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no 
repurchase or substitution pursuant to Section 3.05 (other than a repurchase or
substitution pursuant to Section 3.05(c)) shall be made unless the Company
obtains for the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel addressed to the Trustee that any
such repurchase or substitution would not, under the REMIC Provisions, (i) cause
the Trust to fail to qualify as a REMIC while any regular interest in the REMIC
is outstanding, (ii) result in a tax on prohibited transactions within the
meaning of Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or (iii) constitute a contribution
after the startup day subject to tax under Section 860G(d) of the Code. The
Servicer shall attempt to obtain such Opinion of Counsel. In the case of a
repurchase or deposit pursuant to Section 3.05(a) or 3.05(c), the Company shall,
notwithstanding the absence of such opinion as to the imposition of any tax as
the result of such purchase or deposit, repurchase such Contract or make such
deposit and shall guarantee the payment of such tax by paying to the Trustee the
amount of such tax not later than five Business Days before such tax shall be
due and payable to the extent that amounts previously paid over to and then held
by the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.06 hereof are insufficient to pay such tax
and all other taxes chargeable under Section 6.06. Pursuant to Section 6.06, the
Servicer is hereby directed to withhold, and shall withhold and pay over to the
Trustee, an amount sufficient to pay such tax and any other taxes imposed on
"prohibited transactions" under Section 860F(a)(i) of the Code or imposed on
"contributions after start up date" under Section 860G(d) of the Code from
amounts otherwise distributable to Class C Certificateholders. The Servicer
shall give notice to the Trustee at the time of such repurchase of the amounts
due from the Company pursuant to the guarantee of the Company described above
and notice as to who should receive such payment.

The Trustee shall have no obligation to pay any such amounts pursuant to 
this Section other than from moneys provided to it by the Company or from moneys
held in the funds and accounts created under this Agreement. The Trustee shall
be deemed conclusively to have complied with this Section if it follows the
directions of the Company.

In the event any tax that is guaranteed by the Company pursuant to this
Section 3.06 is refunded to the Trust or otherwise is determined not to be
payable, the Company shall be repaid the amount of such refund or that portion
of any guarantee payment made by the Company that is not applied to the payment
of such tax.

b. The Servicer agrees to maintain the related Contract Files at its
office where they are currently maintained, or at such other offices of the
Servicer in the State of Minnesota as shall from time to time be identified to

Files taken from their storage area by an employee of the Servicer for
purposes of servicing or any other purposes; and

(iii) attend to all details in connection with maintaining custody of
the Contract Files on behalf of the Certificateholders and the Trustee.

d. In performing its duties under this Section, the Servicer agrees to
act with reasonable care, using that degree of skill and care that it exercises
with respect to similar contracts owned and/or serviced by it. The Servicer
shall promptly report to the Trustee any failure by it to hold the Contract
Files as herein provided and shall promptly take appropriate action to remedy
any such failure. In acting as custodian of the Contract Files, the Servicer
agrees further not to assert any beneficial ownership interests in the Contracts
or the Contract Files. The Servicer agrees to indemnify the Certificateholders
and the Trustee for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
payments, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever 

4-1

executive office of the Company, the Company shall given written notice of any
such change to Moody's and Fitch.

b. If any change in the Company's name, identity or structure or the
relocation of its chief executive office would make any financing or
continuation statement or notice of lien filed under this Agreement seriously
misleading within the meaning of applicable provisions of the UCC or any title
statute or would cause any such financing or continuation statement or notice of
lien to become unperfected (whether immediately or with lapse of time), the
Company, no later than five days after the effective date of such change, shall
file, or cause to be filed, such amendments or financing statements as may be
required to preserve, perfect and protect the Certificateholders' interests in
the Contracts and proceeds thereof and in the Manufactured Homes.

----------------------

SECTION 5.01. Responsibility for Contract Administration.
------------------------------------------ 

The Servicer will have the sole obligation to manage, administer, service
and make collections on the Contracts and perform or cause to be performed all
contractual and customary undertakings of the holder of the Contracts to the
Obligor. The Trustee, at the request of a Servicing Officer, shall furnish the
Servicer with any powers of attorney or other documents necessary or appropriate
to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties
hereunder. The Company is hereby appointed the Servicer until such time as any
Service Transfer shall be effected under Article VII.

SECTION 5.02. Standard of Care.
---------------- 

In managing, administering, servicing and making collections on the 
Contracts pursuant to this Agreement, the Servicer will exercise that degree of
skill and care consistent with the highest degree of skill and care that the
Servicer exercises with respect to similar contracts serviced by the Servicer;
provided, however, that (i) such degree of skill and care shall be at least as
- - -------- -------
favorable as the degree of skill and care generally applied by servicers of
manufactured housing installment sales contracts for institutional investors and
(ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not release or waive the
right to collect the unpaid balance on any Contract. The Servicer shall comply
with FHA/VA Regulations in servicing any FHA/VA Contracts (and will pay any
required premiums) so that the related insurance of the Federal Housing
Administration or partial guarantee of the Veterans Administration remains in
full force and effect, except for good faith disputes relating to FHA/VA
Regulations that will not cause the termination or reduction of such insurance
or guarantee.

SECTION 5.03. Records.

such books of account and other records as will enable the Trustee to determine
the status of each Contract.

------------------------- 

a. At all times during the term hereof, the Servicer shall afford the
Trustee and its authorized agents reasonable access during normal business hours
to the Servicer's records, which have not previously been provided to the Trust,

examination of such records by the Trustee or its authorized agents. The
examination referred to in this Section will be conducted in a manner which does
not unreasonably interfere 

5-1
<PAGE>

with the Servicer's normal operations or customer or employee relations. Without
otherwise limiting the scope of the examination the Trustee may make, the
Trustee may, using generally accepted audit procedures, verify the status of
each Contract and review the Electronic Ledger and records relating thereto for
conformity to Monthly Reports prepared pursuant to Article VI and compliance
with the standards represented to exist as to each Contract in this Agreement.

b. At all times during the term hereof, the Servicer shall keep available
a copy of the List of Contracts at its principal executive office for inspection
by Certificateholders.

c. On or before the ninth Business Day of each month, the Servicer will
provide to the Trustee a Computer Tape setting forth a list of all the
outstanding Contracts and the outstanding principal balance of each such
Contract as of the end of the next preceding Due Period.

SECTION 5.05. Certificate Account.
------------------- 

a. On or before the Closing Date, the Trustee shall establish the
Certificate Account on behalf of the Trust with an Eligible Institution. The
Certificate Account shall be entitled "[Trustee] as Trustee for the benefit of
holders of Manufactured Housing Contract Pass-Through Certificates, Series 1994-
5 (Green Tree Financial Corporation, Servicer)." The Servicer shall pay into the
Certificate Account as promptly as practicable (not later than the next Business
Day) following receipt thereof all payments from Obligors and Net Liquidation
Proceeds, other than late payment penalty fees, extension fees and assumption
fees, which shall be retained by the Servicer as additional compensation for
servicing the Contracts. All amounts paid into the Certificate Account under
this Agreement shall be held in trust for the Trustee, the Certificateholders
and the Class C Certificateholders until payment of any such amounts is
authorized under this Agreement. Only the Trustee may withdraw funds from the
Certificate Account.

b. If the Servicer so directs, the Eligible Institution maintaining the
Certificate Account shall, in the name of the Trustee in its capacity as such,
invest the amounts in the Certificate Account in Eligible Investments that
mature not later than one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Remittance
Date. Once such funds are invested, such Eligible Institution shall not change
the investment of such funds. All income and gain from such investments shall be
added to the Certificate Account and distributed on such Remittance Date
pursuant to Section 8.03(a). An amount equal to any net loss on such investments
shall be deposited in the Certificate Account by the Class C Certificateholders
out of their own funds immediately as realized. The Company and the Trustee
shall in no way be liable for losses on amounts invested in accordance with the
provisions hereof. Funds in the Certificate Account not so invested must be
insured to the extent permitted by law by the Federal Deposit Insurance

(ii) (A) demand and time deposits in, certificates of deposit of,

supervision and examination by federal and/or state authorities, so long
as, at the time of such investment or contractual commitment providing for
such investment, the commercial paper or other short-term debt obligations

of such Eligible Investments.

SECTION 5.06. Enforcement.
----------- 

a. The Servicer shall, consistent with customary servicing procedures and
the terms of this Agreement, act with respect to the Contracts in such manner as
will maximize the receipt of principal and interest on such Contracts and
liquidation proceeds with respect to Liquidated Contracts.

b. The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon Contracts, in its own
name, if possible, or as agent for the Trust. If the Servicer elects to commence
a legal proceeding to enforce a Contract, the act of commencement shall be
deemed to be an automatic assignment of the Contract to the Servicer for
purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal
proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Contract on the ground
that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the
Contract, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall, at the Servicer's expense,
take such steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce the Contract,
including bringing suit in its name or the names of the Certificateholders and
Class C Certificateholders.

c. The Servicer shall exercise any rights of recourse against third
persons that exist with respect to any Contract in accordance with the
Servicer's usual practice. In exercising recourse rights, the Servicer is
authorized on the Trustee's behalf to reassign the Contract or to resell the
related Manufactured Home to the person against whom recourse exists at the
price set forth in the document creating the recourse.

d. So long as the Company is the Servicer, the Servicer may grant to the
Obligor on any Contract any rebate, refund or adjustment out of the Certificate
Account that the Servicer in good faith believes is required because of
prepayment in full of the Contract. The Servicer will not permit any rescission
or cancellation of any Contract.

e. So long as the Company is the Servicer, the Servicer may, consistent
with its customary servicing procedures and consistent with Section 5.02, grant
to the Obligor on any Contract an extension of payments due under such Contract,
provided that Obligors may not be solicited for extensions and no more than one
extension of payments under a Contract may be granted in any twelve-month
period.

f. The Servicer may enforce any due-on-sale clause in a Contract if such
enforcement is called for under its then current servicing policies for
obligations similar to the Contracts, provided that such enforcement is
permitted by applicable law and will not adversely affect any applicable
insurance policy. If an assumption 

5-4
<PAGE>

of a Contract is permitted by the Servicer upon conveyance of the related
Manufactured Home, the Servicer shall use its best efforts to obtain an
assumption agreement in connection therewith and add such assumption agreement
to the related Contract File or Land-and-Home Contract File.

g. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Servicer shall not agree to the modification or waiver of any provision of a
Contract at a time when such Contract is not in default or such default is not
reasonably foreseeable, if such modification or waiver would be treated as a
taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code.

SECTION 5.07. Trustee to Cooperate.
-------------------- 

a. Upon payment in full on any Contract, the Servicer will notify the
Trustee and the Company (if the Company is not the Servicer) on the next
succeeding Remittance Date by certification of a Servicing Officer (which
certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received
in connection with such payments which are required to be deposited in the
Certificate Account pursuant to Section 5.05 have been so deposited). The
Servicer is authorized to execute an instrument in satisfaction of such Contract
and to do such other acts and execute such other documents as the Servicer deems
necessary to discharge the Obligor thereunder and eliminate the lien on the
related real estate. The Servicer shall determine when a Contract has been paid
in full; to the extent that insufficient payments are received on a Contract
credited by the Servicer as prepaid or paid in full and satisfied, the shortfall
shall be paid by the Servicer out of its own funds.

b. From time to time as appropriate for servicing and foreclosure in
connection with any Land-and-Home Contract, the Trustee shall, upon written
request of a Servicing Officer and delivery to the Trustee of a receipt signed
by such Servicing Officer, cause the original Land-and-Home Contract and the
related Land-and-Home Contract File to be released to the Servicer and shall
execute such documents as the Servicer shall deem necessary to the prosecution
of any such proceedings. The Trustee shall stamp the face of each such Land-and-
Home Contract to be released to the Servicer with a notation that the Land-and-
Home Contract has been assigned to the Trustee. Upon request of a Servicing
Officer, the Trustee shall perform such other acts as reasonably requested by
the Servicer and otherwise cooperate with the Servicer in enforcement of the
Certificateholders' rights and remedies with respect to Contracts.

c. The Servicer's receipt of a Land-and-Home Contract and/or Land-and-
Home Contract File shall obligate the Servicer to return the original Land-and-
Home Contract and the related Land-and-Home Contract File to the Trustee when
its need by the Servicer has ceased unless the Contract shall be liquidated or
repurchased or replaced as described in Section 3.05.

5-5
<PAGE>

SECTION 5.08. Costs and Expenses.
------------------ 

All costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer in carrying out its duties
hereunder, including all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement of Contracts (including enforcement of defaulted Contracts and
repossessions of Manufactured Homes securing such Contracts) shall be paid by
the Servicer and the Servicer shall not be entitled to reimbursement hereunder,
except that the Servicer shall be reimbursed out of the Liquidation Proceeds of
a Liquidated Contract for Liquidation Expenses incurred by it. The Servicer
shall not incur such liquidation expenses unless it determines in its good faith
business judgment that incurring such expenses will increase the Net Liquidation
Proceeds on the related Contract.

SECTION 5.09. Maintenance of Insurance.
------------------------ 

a. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this Section 5.09,
the Servicer shall cause to be maintained with respect to each Contract one or
more Hazard Insurance Policies which provide, at a minimum, the same coverage as
a standard form fire and extended coverage insurance policy that is customary
for manufactured housing, issued by a company authorized to issue such policies
in the state in which the related Manufactured Home is located and in an amount
which is not less than the maximum insurable value of such Manufactured Home or
the principal balance due from the Obligor on the related Contract, whichever is
less; provided, however, that the amount of coverage provided by each Hazard
-------- ------- 
Insurance Policy shall be sufficient to avoid the application of any co-
insurance clause contained therein; and provided, further, that such Hazard
Insurance Policies may provide for customary deductible amounts. When a
Manufactured Home's location was, at the time of origination of the related
Contract, within a federally designated special flood hazard area, the Servicer
shall also cause such flood insurance to be maintained, which coverage shall be
at least equal to the minimum amount specified in the preceding sentence or such
lesser amount as may be available under the federal flood insurance program.
Each Hazard Insurance Policy caused to be maintained by the Servicer shall
contain a standard loss payee clause in favor of the Servicer and its successors
and assigns. If any Obligor is in default in the payment of premiums on its
Hazard Insurance Policy or Policies, the Servicer shall pay such premiums out of
its own funds and may separately add such premium to the Obligor's obligation as
provided by the Contract, but shall not add such premium to the remaining
principal balance of the Contract.

b. The Servicer may, in lieu of causing individual Hazard Insurance
Policies to be maintained with respect to each Manufactured Home pursuant to
subsection (a) of this Section 5.09, and shall, to the extent that the related
Contract does not require the Obligor to maintain a Hazard Insurance Policy with
respect to the related Manufactured Home, maintain one or more blanket insurance
policies covering losses on the Obligor's interest in the Contracts resulting
from the absence or insufficiency of individual Hazard Insurance Policies. Any
such blanket policy 

5-6
<PAGE>

shall be substantially in the form and in the amount carried by the Servicer as
of the date of this Agreement. The Servicer shall pay the premium for such
policy on the basis described therein and shall deposit into the Certificate
Account from its own funds any deductible amount with respect to claims under
such blanket insurance policy relating to the Contracts. The Servicer shall not,
however, be required to deposit any deductible amount with respect to claims
under individual Hazard Insurance Policies maintained pursuant to subsection (a)
of this Section. If the insurer under such blanket insurance policy shall cease
to be acceptable to the Servicer, the Servicer shall exercise its best
reasonable efforts to obtain from another insurer a replacement policy
comparable to such policy.

c. With respect to each Manufactured Home that has been repossessed in
connection with a defaulted Contract, the Servicer shall either (i) maintain one
or more Hazard Insurance Policies thereon or (ii) self-insure such Manufactured
Homes and deposit into the Certificate Account from its own funds any losses
caused by damage to such Manufactured Home that would have been covered by a
Hazard Insurance Policy.

d. The Servicer shall keep in force throughout the term of this Agreement
(i) a policy or policies of insurance covering errors and omissions for failure
to maintain insurance as required by this Agreement and (ii) a fidelity bond.
Such policy or policies and such fidelity bond shall be in such form and amount
as is generally customary among Persons which service a portfolio of
manufactured housing installment sales contracts and installment loan agreements
having an aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 or more and which are
generally regarded as servicers acceptable to institutional investors.

SECTION 5.10. Repossession.
------------ 

Notwithstanding the standard of care specified in Section 5.02, the 
Servicer shall commence procedures for the repossession of any Manufactured Home
or the foreclosure upon any Mortgaged Property or take such other steps that in
the Servicer's reasonable judgment will maximize the receipt of principal and
interest or Net Liquidation Proceeds with respect to the Contract secured by
such Manufactured Home or Mortgaged Property, (which may include retitling or
filing a recorded assignment of the Mortgage) subject to the requirements of the
applicable state and federal law, no later than five Business Days after the
time when such Contract becomes a Defaulted Contract; provided that if the
Servicer has actual knowledge that a Mortgaged Property is affected by hazardous
waste, then the Servicer shall not cause the Company to acquire title to such
Mortgaged Property in a foreclosure or similar proceeding. For purposes of the
proviso in the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall not be deemed to have
actual knowledge that a Mortgage Property is affected by hazardous waste unless
it shall have received written notice that hazardous waste is present on such
property and such written notice has been made a part of the Land-and-Home
Contract File with respect to the related Contract. In connection with such
foreclosure or other conversion, the 

5-7
<PAGE>

Servicer shall follow such practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary
or advisable and as shall be consistent with Section 5.02. In the event that
title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of
foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be issued to the Trustee, as
Trustee, or, at its election, to its nominee on behalf of the Trustee, as
Trustee.

SECTION 5.11. Commingling of Funds.
-------------------- 

So long as the Company is Servicer, any collections in respect of Contracts
collected by the Company shall, prior to the deposit thereof in the Certificate
Account, be held in bank accounts entitled substantially as follows: "[name of
depository], as agent for First Bank National Association, Trustee, and Green
Tree Financial Corporation, as their interests may appear."

SECTION 5.12. Retitling; Security Interests.
----------------------------- 

a. If, at any time, a Service Transfer has occurred and the Company is no
longer the Servicer and the new Servicer is unable to foreclose upon a
Manufactured Home because the title document for such Manufactured Home does not
show such Servicer or the Trustee as the holder of the first priority security
interest in the Manufactured Home, such Servicer shall take all necessary steps
to apply for a replacement title document showing it or the Trustee as the
secured party.

b. In order to facilitate the Servicer's actions, as described in
subsection (a) of this section, the Company will provide the Servicer with any
necessary power of attorney permitting it to retitle the Manufactured Home.

c. If the Servicer is still unable to retitle the Manufactured Home, the
Company will take all actions necessary to act with the Servicer to foreclose
upon the Manufactured Home, including, as appropriate, the filing of any UCC-1
or UCC-2 financing statements necessary to perfect the security interest in any
Manufactured Home that constitutes a fixture under the laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is located and all actions necessary to perfect the security
interest in any Manufactured Home that is considered or classified as part of
the real estate on which it is located under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is located.

d. If the aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balances of all Land-and-Home
Contracts is less than 10% of the Cut-off Date Pool Principal Balance, then on
the Closing Date the Company shall deliver to the Custodian executed assignments
to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust in recordable form of each Mortgage
securing a Land-and-Home Contract.

If the aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balances of all Land-and-Home
Contracts equals or exceeds 10% of the Cut-off Date Pool Principal Balance, the
Company shall (i) within 60 days of the Closing Date submit to the appropriate

5-8
<PAGE>

recording offices the assignments to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust of the
number of Mortgages securing Land-and-Home Contracts needed to reduce the
aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balances of all Land-and-Home Contracts with
respect to which such assignments are not so recorded to less than 10% of the
Cut-off Date Pool Principal Balance or (ii) deliver an Opinion of Counsel
satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Trustee holds a perfected
first priority lien in the real estate securing the Land-and-Home Contracts.

If at any time during the term of this Agreement the Company does not have
a long-term senior debt rating from Moody's of Baa3 or higher and from Fitch of
BBB- or higher, or an equivalent rating from any other NRSRO then rating the
Certificates, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall file promptly in the
appropriate recording offices the assignments to the Trustee on behalf of the
Trust of each Mortgage securing a Land-and-Home Contract.

examined certain documents and records relating to the servicing of manufactured
housing conditioned sales contracts under pooling and servicing agreements
substantially similar one to another (such statement to have attached thereto a
schedule setting forth the pooling and servicing agreements covered thereby,
including this Agreement) and that, on the basis of such examination, conducted
substantially in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards, such
servicing has been conducted in compliance with such pooling and servicing
agreements, except for such significant exceptions or errors in records that, in
the opinion of such firm, generally accepted auditing standards requires it to
report.

SECTION 6.06. Payment of Taxes.
---------------- 

The Servicer shall be responsible for and agrees to prepare, make and 
file all federal, state, local or other tax returns, information statements and
other returns and documents of every kind and nature whatsoever required to be
made or filed by or on behalf of the Trust pursuant to the Code and other
applicable tax laws and regulations. Each such return, statement and document
shall, to the extent required by the Code or other applicable law and at the
request of the Servicer, be signed on behalf of the Trust by the Trustee. The
Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever for the accuracy or completeness
of any such return, statement or document. The Servicer agrees to indemnify the
Trustee and hold it harmless for, from, against and in respect to any and all
liability, loss, damage and expense which may be incurred by the Trustee based
upon or as a result of the Trustee's execution of any and all such tax returns,
statements and documents. The Servicer, if and for so long as it is a Class C
Certificateholder, shall be designated the "tax matters person" on behalf of the
Trust in the same manner as a partnership may designate a "tax matters partner,"
as such term is defined in Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code. To the extent
permitted by the REMIC Provisions, any subsequent holder of the Class C
Certificate, by acceptance thereof, irrevocably designates and appoints the
Servicer as its agent to perform the responsibilities of the "tax matters
person" on behalf of the Trust if, and during such time as, the Servicer is not
the holder of the Class C Certificate. The Servicer may, at its expense, retain
such outside assistance as it deems necessary in the performance of its
obligations under this paragraph.

6-6
<PAGE>

Each of the Holders of the Certificates or the Class C Certificate, by
acceptance thereof, agrees to file tax returns consistent with and in accordance
with any elections, decisions or other reports made or filed with regard to
federal, state or local taxes on behalf of the Trust. The Company, as agent for
the tax matters person, shall represent the Trust in connection with all
examinations of the Trust's affairs by tax authorities, including resulting
administrative and judicial proceedings. Each of the holders of the Certificates
and Class C Certificates, by acceptance thereof, agrees to cooperate with the
Company in such matters and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
reasonably required by the Company to conduct such proceedings, provided that no
--------
such action shall be required by the Company of any Certificateholder that would
entail unnecessary or unreasonable expenses for such Certificateholder in the
performance of such action.

The Class C Certificateholders shall pay, on behalf of the Trust, any 
foreign, federal, state or local income, property, excise, sales, receipts or
any other similar or related taxes or charges which may be imposed upon the
Trust as a REMIC or otherwise and shall, to the extent provided in Section
10.06, be entitled to be reimbursed out of the Certificate Account or, if such
tax or charge results from a failure by the Trustee, the Company or any Servicer
to comply with the provisions of Section 2.04 or 3.06, the Trustee, the Company
or such Servicer, as the case may be, shall indemnify the Class C
Certificateholders for the payment of any such tax or charge. The Trustee shall
be entitled to withhold from amounts otherwise distributable to the Class C
Certificateholders any taxes or charges payable by the Class C
Certificateholders hereunder.

In the event the Class C Certificate is transferred to a "disqualified
organization," within the meaning of Section 860E(e)(5) of the Code, pursuant to
Section 860D(a)(6)(B) of the Code the Company shall provide to the Internal
Revenue Service and the persons specified in Sections 860(E)(e)(3) and (6) of

a. If an Event of Termination has occurred and is continuing, either the

25% or more of the Trust, by notice in writing to the Servicer (and to the
Trustee if given by the Certificateholders) may terminate all (but not less than
all) of the Servicer's management, administrative, servicing and collection
functions (such termination being herein called a "Service Transfer"). On
receipt of such notice (or, if later, on a date designated therein), or upon
resignation of the Servicer in accordance with Section 12.01, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the
Contracts, the Contract Files, the Land-and-Home Contract Files or otherwise
(except with respect to the Certificate Account, the transfer of which shall be
governed by Section 7.06), shall pass to and be vested in the Trustee pursuant
to and under this Section 7.02; and, without limitation, the Trustee is
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver on behalf of the Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments
(including, without limitation, documents required to make the Trustee or a
successor servicer the sole lienholder or legal title holder of record of each
Manufactured Home) and to do any and all acts or things necessary or appropriate
to effect the purposes of such notice of termination. Each of the Company and

account in connection with its services hereafter or thereafter received with
respect to the Contracts and the execution of any documents required to make the
Trustee or a successor servicer the sole lienholder or legal title holder of
record in respect of each Manufactured Home. The Servicer shall be entitled to
receive any other amounts which are payable to the Servicer under the Agreement,
at the time of the termination of its activities as Servicer. The Servicer shall

Servicer's possession.

SECTION 7.03. Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination 
pursuant to Section 7.02 or the resignation of the Servicer in accordance with
Section 12.01, the Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to the
Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the transactions
set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the responsi-
bilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the
terms and provisions hereof and the Servicer shall be relieved of such responsi-
bilities, duties and liabilities arising after such Service Transfer; provided, 
--------
however, that (i) the Trustee will not assume any obligations of the Company
- - ------- 
pursuant to Section 3.05 and (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any 

7-2
<PAGE>

acts or omissions of the Servicer occurring prior to such Service Transfer
or for any breach by the Servicer of any of its obligations contained herein or
in any related document or agreement. As compensation therefor, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation out of the Monthly
Servicing Fee. Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be
unwilling so to act, or shall, if it is legally unable so to act, appoint, or
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an Eligible Servicer as
the successor to the Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of
the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer hereunder. Pending
appointment of a successor to the Servicer hereunder, unless the Trustee is
prohibited by law from so acting, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as
hereinabove provided. In connection with such appointment and assumption, the
Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
payments on Contracts as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however,
-------- -------
that no such monthly compensation shall, without the written consent of 100% of
the Certificateholders, exceed the Monthly Servicing Fee. The Trustee and such
successor shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be

Contracts after the effective date of the Service Transfer.

b. After the Service Transfer, the replaced Servicer shall have no
further obligations with respect to the management, administration, servicing or

Servicer for its own account, promptly on receipt and in the same form in which
received, any amounts (properly endorsed where required for the new Servicer to
collect them) received as payments upon or otherwise in connection with the
Contracts.

other than those relating to the management, administration, servicing or

a. Subject to the terms of this Article VIII, each Holder of a
Certificate as of a Record Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Remittance
Date by check mailed to such Certificateholder at the address for such
Certificateholder appearing on the Certificate Register (or, if such
Certificateholder holds a Class of Class A Certificates or a Class of Class B
Certificates with an aggregate Percentage Interest of at least 5% or a Class C
Certificateholder holds Class C Certificates with an aggregate Percentage
Interest of at least 20% and so requests, by wire transfer pursuant to

of the Paying Agent.

b. Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate shall be
paid to the Depository, which shall credit the amount of such distribution to

firm") for which it acts as agent. Each brokerage firm shall be responsible for
disbursing funds to the Certificate Owners that it represents. All such credits
and disbursements with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate are to be made by the
Depository and the Depository Participants in accordance with the provisions of
the Book Entry Certificates. Neither the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the
Seller nor the Servicer shall have any responsibility therefor except as
otherwise provided by applicable law. To the extent applicable and not contrary
to the rules of the Depository, the Trustee shall comply with the provisions of
the forms of the Class A and Class B Certificates as set forth in Exhibits A and
B hereto.

c. The Trustee shall appoint an Eligible Institution to be the paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") and cause it to make the payments to the

corporate trust operations department, with an office at 180 East Fifth Street,
St. Paul, Minnesota 55101, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, Structured
Finance, Second Floor, as such Paying Agent. The Trustee shall require the
Paying Agent (if other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that all amounts
held by the Paying Agent for payment hereunder will be held in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders and that it

d. to withdraw any amount deposited in the Certificate Account

e. to make any rebates or adjustments deemed necessary by the 
Servicer pursuant to Section 5.06(d).

Since, in connection with withdrawals pursuant to clause (b), the Company's
entitlement thereto is limited to collections or other recoveries on the related
Contract, the Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting, on a
Contract by Contract basis, for the purpose of justifying any withdrawal from
the Certificate Account pursuant to such clause.

SECTION 8.03. Payments.

shall provide for the registration of Certificates and Class C Certificates and
of transfers 

9-1
<PAGE>

and exchanges of Certificates and Class C Certificates as herein provided. The
Trustee initially appoints itself to be the "Certificate Registrar" and transfer
agent for the purpose of registering Certificates and Class C Certificates and
transfers and exchanges of Certificates and Class C Certificates as provided
herein. The Trustee will give prompt written notice to Certificateholders, Class
C Certificateholders and the Servicer of any change in the Certificate
Registrar.

b. (1) Subject to clauses (2) and (3) below, no transfer of a Class C
Certificate shall be made by the Company or any other Person unless such
transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Act"), as amended, and any applicable state securities laws or is
made in accordance with the Act and laws. In the event that any such transfer is
to be made, (A) the Company may require a written Opinion of Counsel acceptable
to and in form and substance satisfactory to the Company that such transfer may
be made pursuant to an exemption, describing the applicable exemption and the
basis therefor, from the Act and laws or is being made pursuant to the Act and
laws, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trustee or the
Company, and (B) the Trustee shall require the transferee to execute an
investment letter substantially in the form of Exhibit K attached hereto, which
investment letter shall not be an expense of the Trustee or the Company. The
Certificateholder or Class C Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer
shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trustee, the Company and the
Certificate Registrar against any liability that may result if the transfer is
not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

(2) No transfer of a Class B Certificate or a Class C Certificate 
or any interest therein shall be made to any employee benefit plan, trust
or account that is subject to ERISA, or that is described in Section
4975(e)(1) of the Code (each, a "Plan"), unless the prospective transferee
of a Certificate or interest therein provides the Servicer and the Trustee
with a certification of facts and, at its own expense, an Opinion of
Counsel which establish to the satisfaction of the Servicer and the Trustee
that such transfer will not result in a violation of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code or cause the Servicer, the Company or the
Trustee to be deemed a fiduciary of such Plan or result in the imposition
of an excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (A) 
neither the Class C Certificate, nor any interest therein, shall be
transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of to a "disqualified
organization," within the meaning of Section 860E(e)(5) of the Code (a
"Disqualified Organization"), including, but not limited to, (i) the United
States, a state or political subdivision thereof, a foreign government, an
international organization or an agency or instrumentality of any of the
foregoing, (ii) an organization (other than a cooperative described in
Section 521 of the Code) which is exempt from the taxes imposed by Chapter
1 of the Code and not subject to the tax imposed on unrelated business
income by Section 511 of 

9-2
<PAGE>

the Code, or (iii) a cooperative described in Section 1381(a)(2)(C) of the
Code, and (B) prior to any registration of any transfer, sale or other
disposition of the Class C Certificate, the proposed transferee shall
deliver to the Trustee, under penalties of perjury, an affidavit that such
transferee is not a Disqualified Organization, with respect to which the
Trustee shall have no actual knowledge that such affidavit is false, and
the transferor and the proposed transferee shall each deliver for the
Trustee an affidavit with respect to any other information reasonably
required by the Trustee pursuant to the REMIC Provisions, including,
without limitation, information regarding the transfer of noneconomic
residual interests and transfers of any residual interest to or by a
foreign person; provided, however, that, upon the delivery to the Trustee
-------- ------- 
of an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee
and rendered by Independent counsel, to the effect that the beneficial
ownership of the Class C Certificate by any Disqualified Organization will
not result in the imposition of federal income tax upon the Trust or any
Certificateholder or any other person or otherwise adversely affect the
status of the Trust as a REMIC, the foregoing prohibition on transfers,
sales and other dispositions, as well as the foregoing requirement to
deliver a certificate prior to any registration thereof, shall, with
respect to such Disqualified Organization, terminate. Notwithstanding any
transfer, sale or other disposition of the Class C Certificate, or any
interest therein, to a Disqualified Organization or the registration
thereof in the Certificate Register, such transfer, sale or other
disposition and any registration thereof, unless accompanied by the Opinion
of Counsel described in the preceding sentence, shall be deemed to be void
and of no legal force or effect whatsoever and such Disqualified
Organization shall be deemed to not be the Class C Certificateholder for
any purpose hereunder, including, but not limited to, the receipt of
distributions on the Class C Certificate, and shall be deemed to have no
interest whatsoever in the Class C Certificate. Each Class C
Certificateholder, by his acceptance thereof, shall be deemed for all
purposes to have consented to the provisions of this Section 9.02(b)(3).

(4) Any transfer, sale or other disposition not in compliance with 
the provisions of this Section 9.02(b) shall be deemed to be void and of no
legal force or effect whatsoever and such transferee shall be deemed to not
be the Certificateholder or Class C Certificateholder for any purpose
hereunder, including, but not limited to, the receipt of distributions on
the Certificate or Class C Certificate, and shall be deemed to have no
interest whatsoever in the Certificate or Class C Certificate.

(5) The Trustee shall give notice to Moody's and Fitch promptly 
following any transfer, sale or other disposition of a Class C Certificate.

c. At the option of a Certificateholder or Class C Certificateholder,
Certificates and Class C Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates or
Class C Certificates of authorized denominations of a like aggregate original
denomination, 

9-3
<PAGE>

upon surrender of such Certificates or Class C Certificates to be exchanged at
such office. Whenever any Certificates or Class C Certificates are so
surrendered for exchange, the Trustee shall execute and deliver the Certificates
or Class C Certificates which the Certificateholder making the exchange is
entitled to receive. Every Certificate or Class C Certificates presented or
surrendered for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed by, or shall be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the holder thereof or his
or her attorney duly authorized in writing.

d. Except as provided in paragraph (e) below the Book-Entry Certificates
shall at all times remain registered in the name of the Depository or its
nominee and at all times: (i) registration of the Class A and Class B
Certificates may not be transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository;
(ii) the Depository shall maintain book-entry records with respect to the
Certificate Owners and with respect to ownership and transfers of such Class A
and Class B Certificates; (iii) ownership and transfers of registration of the
Class A and Class B Certificates on the books of the Depository shall be
governed by applicable rules established by the Depository; (iv) the Depository
may collect its usual and customary fees, charges and expenses from its
Depository Participants; (v) the Trustee shall deal with the Depository,
Depository Participants and indirect participating firms as representatives of
the Certificate Owners of the Class A and Class B Certificates for purposes of
exercising the rights of Holders under this Agreement, and requests and
directions for and votes of such representatives shall not be deemed to be
inconsistent if they are made with respect to different Certificate Owners; and
(vi) the Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon
information furnished by the Depository with respect to its Depository
Participants and furnished by the Depository Participants with respect to
indirect participating firms and persons shown on the books of such indirect
participating firms as direct or indirect Certificate Owners.

All transfers by Certificate Owners of Book-Entry Certificates shall be 
made in accordance with the procedures established by the Depository Participant
or brokerage firm representing such Certificate Owner. Each Depository
Participant shall only transfer Book-Entry Certificates of Certificate Owners it
represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as agent in accordance with
the Depository's normal procedures.

e. If (x)(i) the Company or the Depository advises the Trustee in writing
that the Depository is no longer willing or able properly to discharge its
responsibilities as Depository and (ii) the Trustee or the Company is unable to
locate a qualified successor or (y) the Company at its sole option advises the
Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the
Depository, the Trustee shall notify all Certificate Owners, through the
Depository, of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
definitive, fully registered Class A Certificates or Class B Certificates (the
"Definitive Certificates") to Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon
surrender to the Trustee of the Class A Certificates or Class B Certificates by
the Depository, accompanied by registration instructions from 

9-4
<PAGE>

the Depository for registration, the Trustee shall issue the Definitive
Certificates. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay
in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates all references herein to obligations imposed upon or to be
performed by the Depository shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by
the Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive
Certificates and the Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive
Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.

f. On or prior to the Closing Date, there shall be delivered to the
Depository one Class A-1 Certificate, one Class A-2 Certificate, one Class A-3
Certificate, one Class A-4 Certificate, one Class A-5 Certificate, one Class B-1
Certificate and one Class B-2 Certificate, each in registered form registered
in the name of the Depository's nominee, Cede & Co., the total face amount of
which represents 100% of the Original Class A-1 Principal Balance, the Original
Class A-2 Principal Balance, the Original Class A-3 Principal Balance, the
Original Class A-4 Principal Balance, the Original Class A-5 Principal
Balance, the Original Class B-1 Principal Balance and the Original Class B-2
Principal Balance, respectively. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of
a Class of Class A Certificates or a Class of Class B Certificates exceeds
$150,000,000, one Class A Certificate and/or one Class B Certificate will be
issued with respect to each $150,000,000 of principal amount and an additional
Certificate of such Class or Classes will be issued with respect to any
remaining principal amount. Each such Class A or Class B Certificate registered
in the name of the Depositary's nominee shall bear the following legend:

"Unless this Certificate is presented by an authorized representative of 
The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC") to the Trustee or
its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate
issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as
requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to
Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized
representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR
OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner
hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein."

SECTION 9.03. No Charge; Disposition of Void Certificates or Class C
------------------------------------------------------
Certificates.
- - ------------ 

No service charge shall be made to a Certificateholder or Class C
Certificateholder for any transfer or exchange of Certificates or Class C
Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates or Class C
Certificates. All Certificates or Class C Certificates surrendered for transfer
and exchange shall be disposed of in a manner approved by the Trustee.

SECTION 9.04. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates or 
----------------------------------------------------
Class C Certificates.

If (a) any mutilated Certificate or Class C Certificate is surrendered to 
the Certificate Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate or Class C
Certificate, and (b) there is delivered to the Certificate Registrar and the
Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by each to save it
harmless, then in the absence of notice to the Certificate Registrar or the
Trustee that such Certificate or Class C Certificate has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser, the Trustee shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in
lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate or Class C
Certificate, a new Certificate or Class C Certificate of like tenor and original
denomination. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate or Class C Certificate
under this Section 9.04, the Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation
thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. Any duplicate Certificate or
Class C Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall constitute
complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership of the Percentage Interest, as
if originally issued, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificate or Class C Certificate shall be found at any time.

SECTION 9.05. Persons Deemed Owners.
---------------------

Certificate or Class C Certificate for the purpose of receiving remittances
pursuant to Section 8.01 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the
Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Paying Agent
or any agent of the Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the
Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 9.06. Access to List of Certificateholders' and Class C
-------------------------------------------------
Certificateholders' Names and Addresses.
- - --------------------------------------- 

The Certificate Registrar will furnish to the Trustee and the Servicer, 
within five days after receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request
therefor from the Trustee in writing, a list, in such form as the Trustee may
reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders and
Class C Certificateholders as of the most recent Record Date. If Holders of
Certificates evidencing, as to any Class, Percentage Interests representing 25%
or more (hereinafter referred to as "Applicants") apply in writing to the
Trustee, and such application states that the Applicants desire to communicate
with other Certificateholders or Class C Certificateholders with respect to
their rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates or Class C
Certificates and is accompanied by a copy of the 

9-6
<PAGE>

communication which such Applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall,
within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford such
Applicants access during normal business hours to the most recent list of
Certificateholders or Class C Certificateholders held by the Trustee. If such
list is as of a date more than 90 days prior to the date of receipt of such
Applicants' request, the Trustee shall promptly request from the Certificate
Registrar a current list as provided above, and shall afford such Applicants
access to such list promptly upon receipt. Every Certificateholder or Class C
Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate or Class C
Certificates, agrees with the Certificate Registrar and the Trustee that none of
the Company, the Certificate Registrar or the Trustee shall be held accountable
by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders or Class C Certificateholders hereunder,
regardless of the source from which such information was derived.

SECTION 9.07. Authenticating Agents.
--------------------- 

The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with power to 
act on its behalf and subject to its direction in the execution and delivery of
the Certificates or Class C Certificates. For all purposes of this Agreement,
the execution and delivery of Certificates or Class C Certificates by the
Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be the
execution and delivery of Certificates or Class C Certificates "by the Trustee."

holders from, any taxes which may at any time be asserted with respect to, and

or omitted to be taken by the Servicer with respect to any Contract. This

charges imposed upon the Trust as a REMIC or otherwise, such taxes or charges,
except to the extent set forth in the following proviso, shall be expenses and
costs of the Trust and the Class C Certificateholders shall be entitled to be
reimbursed therefor out of the Certificate Account as provided in Section 8.03;
provided, however, that any such taxes or charges shall not be expenses or costs
- - -------- ------- 
of the Trust, nor will the Class C Certificateholders be entitled to reimburse-
ment therefor out of the Certificate Account, if and to the extent that such

THE TRUSTEE
-----------

SECTION 11.01. Duties of Trustee.
----------------- 

The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after
the curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement. If an Event of Termination has occurred (which has not been cured),
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his
own affairs.

The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to the
Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they 
conform as to form to the requirements of this Agreement.

Subject to Section 11.03, no provision of this Agreement shall be 
construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action,
its own negligent failure to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:
-------- ------- 

a. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, and after the
curing of all such Events of Termination which may have occurred, the duties and
obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions
of this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of
such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee
may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to
the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement;

b. The Trustee shall not be liable for an error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that
the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

c. The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the direction of the Certificateholders with aggregate Percentage Interests
representing 25% or more of the Trust relating to the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Agreement; and

11-1
<PAGE>

d. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any event referred
to in Section 7.01 unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate
Trust Office obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Trustee receives
written notice of such event from the Servicer or the Holders of Certificates
evidencing, as to any Class, Percentage Interests representing 25% or more.

None of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event 
require the Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance
of, any of the obligations of the Company or the Servicer under this Agreement,
except during such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and
be vested with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Servicer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Trustee shall not be required
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment
of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

SECTION 11.02. Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.
------------------------------------- 

Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.01:

a. The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any resolution, Officer's Certificate, certificate of a
Servicing Officer, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or
other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties;

b. The Trustee may consult with counsel and any opinion of any counsel
for the Company or the Servicer shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

c. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers vested in it by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation hereunder or in relation hereto, at the request, order or direction
of any of the Certificateholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
unless such Certificateholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred therein or thereby; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
-------- ------- 
shall relieve the Trustee of the obligations, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Termination (which has not been cured), to exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Agreement, and to use the same degree of care and
skill in their exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs;

11-2
<PAGE>

d. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after the
curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, the Trustee shall
not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless
requested in writing so to do by Holders of Certificates evidencing, as to any
Class, Percentage Interests representing 25% or more; provided, however, that if
-------- ------- 
the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or
liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is,
in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the
security afforded to it by the terms of this Agreement, the Trustee may require
reasonable indemnity against such cost, expense or liability as a condition to
so proceeding. The reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid by
the Servicer or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be reimbursed by the Servicer
upon demand; and

e. The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or
perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
attorneys or a custodian and shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of
such agents, attorneys or custodians if appointed by it with due care hereunder.

SECTION 11.03. Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Contracts.
------------------------------------------------ 

The Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the recitals
contained herein, in the Certificates or in the Class C Certificates (other than
the Trustee's execution thereof). The Trustee makes no representations as to the
validity or sufficiency of this Agreement, of the Certificates or of the Class C
Certificates (other than its execution thereof) or of any Contract, Contract
File, Land-and-Home Contract File or related document. The Trustee shall not be
accountable for the use or application by the Servicer or the Company of funds
paid to the Company in consideration of conveyance of the Contracts to the Trust
by the Company or deposited into or withdrawn from the Certificate Account by
the Servicer.

SECTION 11.04. Rights of Certificateholders to Direct Trustee and to 
-----------------------------------------------------
Waive Event of Termination.
- - -------------------------- 

Holders of Class A Certificates and Holders of Class B Certificates
evidencing, as to each such Class, Percentage Interests representing 25% or more
shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee; provided, however, that, subject to Section
-------- ------- 
11.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction
if the Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so directed
may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a
Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceedings
so directed would be illegal or involve it in personal liability or be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of Certificateholders not parties to such direction;

11-3
<PAGE>

and provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right of
-------- ------- 
the Trustee to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not
inconsistent with such direction by the Certificateholders; and provided further
-------- -------
that the Trustee shall instead follow the directions of Holders of Class A
Certificates and Holders of Class B Certificates evidencing, as to each such
Class, Percentage Interests aggregating 51% or more whenever it receives
conflicting directions from Class A Certificateholders and Class B Certificate-
holders. Holders of Class A Certificates and Holders of Class B Certificates 
evidencing, as to each such Class, Percentage Interests representing 51% or 
more may on behalf of Certificateholders waive any past Event of Termination 
hereunder and its consequences, except a default in respect of a covenant or
------ 
provision hereof which under Section 12.07 cannot be modified or amended without
the consent of all Certificateholders, and upon any such waiver, such Event of
Termination shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been cured for
every purpose of this Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Event of Termination or impair any right consequent thereon.
Following the Fifth Cross-over Date, if all distributions payable to the Class A
Certificateholders have either been made or provided for in accordance with this
Agreement, then the Holders of Class B Certificates may exercise the rights
given to the Class A Certificateholders under this Section.

SECTION 11.05. The Servicer to Pay Trustee's Fees and Expenses.
----------------------------------------------- 

The Servicer agrees:

a. to pay to the Trustee reasonable compensation for all services
rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
trust);

b. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
Trustee, to the extent requested by the Trustee, for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in
accordance with any provision of this Agreement (including the reasonable
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel),
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to
its negligence or bad faith; and

c. to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, 
any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on
its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of this trust and its duties hereunder, including the costs
and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in
connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties
hereunder.

All such payments by the Servicer shall be made from its own funds. The
covenants in this Section 11.05 shall be for the benefit of the Trustee in its
capacities 

11-4
<PAGE>

as Trustee, Paying Agent and Certificate Registrar hereunder, and shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.06. Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.
------------------------------------ 

The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a financial institution 
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and a
Title I approved lender pursuant to FHA Regulations, and shall have a combined
capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or shall be a member of a bank
holding system the aggregate combined capital and surplus of which is
$50,000,000, provided that the Trustee's separate capital and surplus shall at
-------- 
all times be at least the amount required by Section 310(a)(2) of the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. If such Person publishes reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of a supervising or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 11.06, the combined
capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital
and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In
addition, the Trustee shall at all times have a long-term deposit rating from
Moody's of at least Baa3 or as shall be otherwise acceptable to Moody's and a
long-term deposit rating from Fitch (if rated by Fitch) of at least BBB- or as
shall be otherwise acceptable to Fitch. In case at any time the Trustee shall
cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.06,
the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified
in Section 11.07.

SECTION 11.07. Resignation or Removal of Trustee.
--------------------------------- 

The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby
created by giving written notice thereof to the Servicer and the Company. A copy
of any such notice shall be sent to Moody's and Fitch. Upon receiving such
notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by
written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to each of the Servicer and the Company and one copy to the successor
Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed and shall have
accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 11.06 and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Company, or if at any time the Trustee shall be legally unable
to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the
Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take
charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose
of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Company may remove the
Trustee. If the Company shall have removed the Trustee under the authority of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in 

11-5
<PAGE>

duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so
removed and one copy to the successor Trustee.

Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 11.07 shall not become
effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided
in Section 11.08.

SECTION 11.08. Successor Trustee.
----------------- 

Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 11.07 shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Servicer, the Company and to its predecessor
Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become effective and
such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee. The
predecessor Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the successor
Trustee the Contracts, Contract Files and Land-and-Home Contract Files and any
related documents and statements held by it hereunder; and, if the Land-and-Home
Contract Files are then held by a custodian pursuant to a custodial agreement,
the predecessor Trustee and the custodian shall amend such custodial agreement
to make the successor Trustee the successor to the predecessor Trustee
thereunder; and the Servicer, the Company and the predecessor Trustee shall
execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably
be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor
Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

In connection with any offset defenses, or affirmative claims for recovery,

upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VII.

SECTION 11.12. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.
--------------------------------------------- 

The Company shall have the power from time to time to appoint one or more

legal requirement, restriction or condition (i) with respect to the holding of
the Contracts, the Contract Files and the Land-and-Home Contract Files or (ii)
with respect to the enforcement of a Contract in any state in which a
Manufactured Home is located or in any state in which any portion of the Trust
is located. The separate trustees, co-trustees, or custodians so appointed shall
be trustees or custodians for the benefit of all Certificateholders and shall,
subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, have such powers, rights
and remedies as shall be specified in the instrument of appointment; provided, 
-------- 
however, that no such appointment shall, or shall be deemed to, constitute the 
- - ------- 
appointee an agent of the Trustee.

Every separate trustee, co-trustee and custodian shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and
conditions:

(A) all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred upon the 
Trustee in respect of the receipt, custody and payment of monies shall be
exercised solely by the Trustee;

(B) all other rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or 
imposed upon the Trustee, to the extent also imposed upon such separate
trustees, co-trustees or custodians, shall be conferred or imposed upon and
exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee, co-
trustee, or custodian jointly, except to the extent that under any law of
any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed,
the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or
acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including
holding of the Trust or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall
be exercised and performed by such separate trustee, co-trustee, or
custodian;

11-8
<PAGE>

(C) no separate trustee, co-trustee or custodian hereunder shall be
personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other separate
trustee, co-trustee or custodian hereunder; and

(D) the Company may at any time accept the resignation of or remove
any separate trustee, co-trustee or custodian, so appointed by it.

If any separate trustee, co-trustee or custodian shall die, become 
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties,
rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee, to
the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor
trustee or custodian. The reasonable fees and expenses of any such separate
trustee, co-trustee or custodian shall be treated as additional fees and
expenses of the Trustee subject to Section 11.05 and payable by the Servicer if
and only to the extent the Servicer shall have consented in writing to his or
its appointment, which consent shall not be unnecessarily withheld.

SECTION 11.13. Agents of Trustee.

To the extent not prohibited by law and not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 11.12), the Trustee may,

shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it except
upon determination that the performance of its duties hereunder is no longer
permissible under applicable law or is in material conflict by reason of
applicable law with any other activities carried on by it. Any such
determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by
an Opinion of Counsel for the Servicer to such effect addressed and delivered to
the Trustee. No such resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or a
successor servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of
the Servicer in accordance with Sections 7.02 and 7.03.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person into which the Servicer may be
merged or consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion
or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or any Person
succeeding to the business of the Servicer, shall be the successor of the
Servicer hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person to
-------- ------- 
the Servicer shall satisfy the criteria set forth in the definition of an
Eligible Servicer. The Servicer shall promptly notify Moody's and Fitch of any
such merger to which it is a party.

provided, that in no event shall the trust created hereby continue beyond the
- - -------- 
expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the descendants of
Joseph P. Kennedy, the late Ambassador of the United States to the Court of St.
James, living on the date hereof; and provided, further, that the Servicer's and

the Company's representations and warranties and indemnities by the Company and
the Servicer shall survive termination.

b. Notice of any termination, specifying the Final Remittance Date (which

Certificateholders or Class C Certificateholders may surrender their
Certificates or Class C Certificates to the Company for payment of the final
distribution and cancellation, shall be given promptly by the Trustee (upon

by letter to Moody's and Fitch, the Certificateholders and the Class C
Certificateholders mailed no later than the fifth Business Day of the month of

final payment; and (3) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such
Remittance Date is not applicable, payments being made only upon presentation
and surrender of the Certificates and Class C Certificates at the office or

the Company pursuant to Section 8.05 shall constitute the adoption by the
Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders of a plan of complete liquidation
within the meaning of Section 860F of the Code on the date such notice is given
when signed by the Trustee. Each such notice shall, to the extent required by
the REMIC Provisions or other applicable law, be signed on behalf of the Trust
by the Trustee. The Trustee shall give such notice to the Certificate Registrar
at the time such notice is given to the Certificateholders and Class C
Certificateholders. In the event such notice is given in connection with the
Company's election to purchase the Contracts, the Company shall deposit in the
Certificate Account on the Final Remittance Date in immediately available funds
an amount equal to the above-described purchase price and upon such deposit
Certificateholders and Class C Certificateholders will be entitled to the amount
of such purchase price but not amounts in excess thereof, all as provided

final deposit the Trustee shall promptly release to the Company the Contract
Files for the remaining Contracts, and the Trustee shall execute all
assignments, endorsements and other instruments necessary to effectuate such
transfer.

c. Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee shall

the distribution otherwise required to be made on such Remittance Date in
respect of each Class of Certificates.

d. In the event that all of the Certificateholders and Class C
Certificateholders do not surrender their Certificates and Class C Certificates
for cancellation within three months after the time specified in the above-
mentioned written notice, the Company shall give a second written notice to the
remaining Certificateholders and Class C Certificateholders to surrender their
Certificates and Class C Certificates for cancellation and receive the final
distribution with respect thereto. If within three months after the second
notice all the Certificates and Class C Certificates shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, the Company shall transfer to itself all amounts
remaining on deposit in the Certificate Account, to hold in trust for
Certificateholders and Class C Certificateholders who have not surrendered their
Certificates and Class C Certificates for cancellation, together with the final
record list of Certificateholders and Class C Certificateholders, and the
Company shall take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take
appropriate steps, to contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning
surrender of their Certificates and Class C Certificates, and the cost thereof
shall be paid out of the funds and other assets which remain in trust hereunder.

e. Each Certificateholder and Class C Certificateholder hereby
irrevocably approves and appoints the Trustee as its attorney-in-fact for the
purposes of adoption of the plan of complete liquidation.

merged or consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion
or consolidation to which the Company shall be a party, or any Person succeeding

--------- 

a. This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Company, the
Servicer and the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Certificateholders
or Class C Certificateholders, to correct manifest error, to cure any ambiguity,
to correct or supplement any provisions herein which may be inconsistent with
any other provisions herein, as the case may be, to make such changes as are
necessary to maintain the status of the Trust as a "real estate mortgage
investment conduit" under the REMIC Provisions of the Code or to otherwise
effectuate the benefits of such status to the Trust, the Certificateholders and
the Class C Certificateholders, including, without limitation, to implement any
provision permitted by law that would enable a REMIC to avoid the imposition of
any tax, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions
arising under this Agreement that shall not be inconsistent with the provisions
of this Agreement; provided, however, that such action shall not, as evidenced
-------- ------- 
by an Opinion of Counsel for the Company, adversely affect in any material
respect the interests of any Certificateholder.

b. This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Servicer,
the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of Holders of Certificates of each

all Certificates then outstanding, (c) result in the disqualification of the
Trust as a REMIC under the Code, (d) adversely affect the status of the Trust as
a REMIC or the status of the Certificates as "regular interests" therein or (e)

regard to such amendment) to be imposed on the Trust, including, without
limitation, any tax imposed on "prohibited 

12-5

consent of 100% of Certificateholders and all Class C Certificateholders if such

Section 12.07, the Trustee shall furnish written notification to Moody's and
Fitch of such solicitation. Promptly after the execution of any amendment
pursuant to this Section 12.07, the Trustee shall furnish written notification
of the substance of such amendment to Moody's, Fitch and each Certificateholder
and Class C Certificateholder.

e. It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders under
this Section 12.07 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but
it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The
manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the
execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable
requirements as the Trustee may prescribe.

f. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such
amendment which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under
this Agreement or otherwise.

shall be entitled to receive an unqualified Opinion of Counsel to the Servicer
to the effect that such amendment is authorized or permitted by the Agreement.

h. In the absence of the consent described in subsection (d) of this
Section, in connection with any amendment pursuant to this Section, the Trustee

shall not be an expense of the Trust, stating that any such amendment (i) will
not adversely affect the status of the Trust as a REMIC or the status of the
Certificates as "regular interests" therein, and (ii) will not cause any tax
(other than any tax imposed on "net income from foreclosure property" under
Section 860G(c)(1) of the Code that would be imposed without regard to such
amendment) to be imposed on the Trust, including, without limitation, any tax
imposed on "prohibited transactions" under Section 860F(a)(1) of the Code or on

THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT REPRESENT AN OBLIGATION OF OR AN INTEREST IN

SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT.

This certifies that ____________________ is the registered owner of the
undivided Percentage Interest represented by the original principal amount set

agreements (including, without limitation, all related security interests and

A-1
<PAGE>

receive payments which are due pursuant thereto on or after August 1, 1994). The
Trust has been created pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the
"Agreement"), dated as of August 1, 1994, between Green Tree Financial
Corporation, as Seller and Servicer (the "Company"), and First Bank National
Association, as Trustee of the Trust (the "Trustee"). This Certificate is one of
the Certificates described in the Agreement and is issued pursuant and subject
to the Agreement. By acceptance of this Certificate the holder assents to and
becomes bound by the Agreement. To the extent not defined herein, all
capitalized terms have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.

The Agreement contemplates, subject to its terms, payment on the fifteenth
day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day)
(the "Remittance Date") of each calendar month commencing September 15, 1994, so
long as the Agreement has not been terminated, by check (or, if such
Certificateholder holds a Class of Class A Certificates with an aggregate

instructions delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to such Remittance
Date) to the registered Certificateholder at the address appearing on the

Interest of the portion of the Class A Distribution Amount to be distributed to
such Class of Class A Certificates. The final scheduled Remittance Date of this
Certificate is December 15, 2019 or the next succeeding Business Day if such
December 15 is not a Business Day.

The Certificateholder, by its acceptance of this Certificate, agrees that
it will look solely to the funds in the Certificate Account to the extent
available for distribution to the Certificateholder as provided in the Agreement
for payment hereunder and that the Trustee in its individual capacity is not
personally liable to the Certificateholder for any amounts payable under this
Certificate or the Agreement or, except as expressly provided in the Agreement,
subject to any liability under the Agreement. By acceptance of this Certificate,
the Certificateholder agrees to disclosure of his, her or its name and address
to other Certificateholders under the conditions specified in the Agreement.

This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Agreement and reference
is made to the Agreement for information with respect to the interests, rights,
benefits, obligations, proceeds and duties evidenced hereby and the rights,
duties and immunities of the Trustee. Copies of the Agreement and all amendments
thereto will be provided to any Certificateholder free of charge upon a written
request to the Trustee.

As provided in the Agreement and subject to the limitations set forth 
therein, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate
Register of the Certificate Registrar upon surrender of this Certificate for

FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY
------------------------------------------

The opinion of Dorsey & Whitney shall be to the effect that (capitalized 
terms have the meanings set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement):

1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota, with corporate power
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (including the Limited Guarantee contained therein), the Certificates
and the Class C Certificate. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
performance of its duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
Certificates and the Class C Certificate would require such qualification.

2. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement has been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action, duly executed and delivered by the Company, and
constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in
accordance with their terms. The Certificates have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action and, when duly and validly executed by the Trustee in
accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, will be validly issued and
outstanding and entitled to the benefits of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

3. No consent, approval, authorization or order of any state or federal
court or governmental agency or body is required to be obtained by the Company
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, except such as may be required under blue sky laws under
any jurisdiction in connection with the offering of the Certificates by
Underwriter pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.

4. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement is not required to be qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as now in effect, and the Trust is not
required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

5. Neither the transfer of the Contracts to the Trustee acting on behalf
of the Trust, nor the assignment of the Company's security interest in the
related Manufactured Homes, nor the issuance or sale of the Certificates and the
Class C Certificate, nor the execution and delivery of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (including the Limited Guarantee contained therein), nor the
consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, nor the fulfillment of the terms of the Certificates, the
Class C Certificate or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by the Company will
conflict with, or result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or
constitute a default under, any term or provision of 

E-1
<PAGE>

the Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or of any
indenture or other agreement or instrument known to us to which the Company is a
party or by which it is bound, or result in a violation of, or contravene the
terms of any statute, order or regulation, applicable to the Company, of any
court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having
jurisdiction over it.

6. There are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the best of our
knowledge, actions, proceedings or investigations pending or overtly threatened
against the Company before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal
(A) asserting the invalidity of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
Certificates, the Class C Certificate, the hazard or flood insurance policies
applicable to any Contracts or the Errors and Omissions Protection Policy, (B)
seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates or the Class C Certificate
or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, (C) which is likely materially and adversely to affect the
performance by the Company of its obligations under, or the validity or
enforceability of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificates or the
Class C Certificate, or (D) seeking adversely to affect the federal income tax
attributes of the Certificates or the Class C Certificate described in the
Prospectus under the heading "Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences."

7. The Company is duly registered as a finance company in each state in
which Contracts were originated, to the extent such registration is required by
applicable law.

8. The transfer of the Contracts to the Trust in accordance with Section
2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement would not be avoidable as a
preferential transfer under Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code 
(11U.S.C. (S) 547), as in effect on the date hereof, in the event that the
Company became a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

9. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement the Company has
transferred to the Trustee acting on behalf of the Trust all of the Company's
right, title and interest in the Contracts, free and clear of any and all other
assignments, encumbrances, options, rights, claims, liens or security interests
(except tax or possessory liens) that may affect the right of the Trustee in and
to such Contracts, and has delivered the Land-and-Home Contract Files to the
Trustee or its custodian. No filing or other action, other than the filing of a
financing statement on Form UCC-1 with the Secretary of State of the State of
Minnesota identifying the Contracts as collateral and naming the Company as
debtor and the Trust as secured party, and the filing of continuation statements
as required by Section 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, is necessary
to perfect as against third parties the assignment of the Contracts by the
Company to the Trust. We have separately provided you with our opinion
concerning whether such assignment could be recharacterized as a pledge rather
than a sale in the event the Company became a debtor under the United States
Bankruptcy Code. However, in the event such assignment were 

E-2
<PAGE>

characterized as a pledge securing a loan from the Certificateholders to the
Company, it is our opinion that the Trustee would be deemed to have a valid and
perfected security interest in the Contracts and the proceeds thereof, which
security interest would be prior to any other security interest that may be
perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of
Minnesota and over any "lien creditor" (as defined in Minn. Stat. 
(S)336.9-301(3)) who becomes such after the Closing Date, except that a
subsequent purchaser of any Contract who gives new value and takes possession
thereof in the ordinary course of his business would have priority over the
Trustee's security interest in such Contract, if such purchaser acts without
knowledge that such Contract was subject to a security interest. We have assumed
for the purposes of this opinion that during the term of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement the Trustee, or its custodian, shall maintain possession of
the Land-and-Home Contract Files for the purpose of perfecting the assignment to
the Trustee of the Land-and-Home Contracts.

10. In reliance upon certain representations and warranties set forth in
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and assuming that the Company and the
Trustee comply with the requirements of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
including the filing of a proper election, as of the date hereof the Trust
created pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will qualify as a REMIC.
Further, the Certificates will evidence ownership of the "regular interests" and
the Class C Certificate will evidence ownership of the single class of "residual
interest" in such REMIC. For Minnesota income tax purposes, and subject to the
foregoing assumptions, and the provisions of Minnesota law as of the date
hereof, such Trust will not be subject to tax and the income of such Trust will
be taxable to the holders of interests therein, all in accordance with the
provisions of the Code concerning REMICs as amended through December 31, 1993.
Moreover, ownership of a Certificate will not be a factor in determining whether
such owner is subject to Minnesota income taxes. Therefore, if the owner of a
Certificate is not otherwise subject to Minnesota income or franchise taxes in
the State of Minnesota, such owner will not become subject to such Minnesota
taxes solely by virtue of owning a Certificate.

11. The transfer of the Contracts and the proceeds thereof by the Company
to the Trustee on the date hereof pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement would not be avoidable as a fraudulent transfer under the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act as in effect in Minnesota on the date hereof (Minn.
Stat. (S)(S) 513.41 through 513.51), nor, should the Company become a debtor
under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as a fraudulent transfer under Section
548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. (S) 548) as in effect on the
date hereof.

RE: Manufactured Housing Contract Senior/Subordinate Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 1994-5, Class C

The undersigned purchaser (the "Purchaser") understands that the purchase
of the above-referenced certificates (the "Certificates") may be made only by
institutions which are "Accredited Investors" under Regulation D, as promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), which includes
banks, savings and loan associations, registered brokers and dealers, insurance
companies, investment companies, and organizations described in Section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, corporations, business trusts and
partnerships, not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the Certificates
offered, with total assets in excess of $5,000,000. The undersigned represents
on behalf of the Purchaser that the Purchaser is an "Accredited Investor" within
the meaning of such definition. The Purchaser is urged to review carefully the
responses, representations and warranties it is making herein.

Representations and Warranties
- - ------------------------------

The Purchaser makes the following representations and warranties in order 
to permit the Trustee, Green Tree Financial Corporation, and [underwriter of the
Class C Certificates] to determine its suitability as a purchaser of
Certificates and to determine that the exemption from registration relied upon
by Green Tree Financial Corporation under Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act is
available to it.

1. The Purchaser understands that the Certificates have not been and will
not be registered under the 1933 Act and may be resold (which resale is not
currently contemplated) only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the
1933 Act or if an exemption from registration is available, that Green Tree
Financial Corporation is not required to register the Certificates and that any
transfer must comply with Section 9.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
relating to the Certificates.

2. The Purchaser will comply with all applicable federal and state
securities laws in connection with any subsequent resale of the Certificates.

3. The Purchaser is a sophisticated institutional investor and has
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Certificates and is
able to bear the economic risk of such investment. The Purchaser has reviewed
the Private Placement Memorandum (the "Memorandum") dated ______________,
_______, with respect to the Certificates, and has been given such information
concerning the Certificates, the underlying installment sale contracts and Green
Tree Financial Corporation as it has requested.

4. The Purchaser is acquiring the Certificates as principal for its own
account (or for the account of one or more other institutional investors for
which it is acting as duly authorized fiduciary or 

K-1
<PAGE>

agent) for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for sale in
connection with any distribution thereof, subject nevertheless to any
requirement of law that the disposition of the Purchaser's property shall at all
times be and remain within its control.

5. The Purchaser does not qualify as (i) an employee benefit plan (a
"Plan") as defined in section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), whether or not it is subject to the
provisions of Title I of ERISA, (ii) a plan described in section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (also a "Plan"), or (iii) an entity whose
underlying assets are deemed to be assets of a Plan by reason of such Plan's
investment in the entity (as determined under Department of Labor Regulations,
29 C.F.R. (S)2510.3-101 (1990)).

6. The Purchaser understands that such Certificate will bear a legend
substantially as set forth in the form of Certificate included in the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement.

7. The Purchaser, as holder of the Class C Certificate, acknowledges (i)
it may incur tax liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the
interest and (ii) it intends to pay the taxes associated with holding the Class
C Certificate as they become due.

8. The Purchaser agrees that it will obtain from any purchaser of the
Certificates from it the same representations, warranties and agreements
contained in the foregoing paragraphs 1 through 7 and in this paragraph 8.

The representations and warranties contained herein shall be binding upon
the heirs, executors, administrators and other successors of the undersigned. If
there is more than one signatory hereto, the obligations, representations,
warranties and agreements of the undersigned are made jointly and severally.
