FIRST FINANCIAL CORPORATION (WI) REPORTS RECORD EARNINGS

Stevens Point, Wisconsin, January 17, 1994... First Financial

Corporation (FFHC-OTC) today reported record net income for the

fourth quarter and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993.

For the fourth quarter, the company reported net income of $13.2

million, or $.54 per share, up 45% from the $9.1 million, or $.38

per share, reported for the fourth quarter of 1992. For the year,

net income was $45.2 million, or $1.88 per share, up 59% from

$28.4 million, or $1.21 per share, for 1992 (prior to a change in

accounting for income taxes of $5.6 million, or $.24 per share,

taken during 1992).

The company's return on average assets (ROA) for the fourth

quarter increased to 1.11%, up from .94% for the fourth quarter

of last year. For the year, ROA was .98%, up from .79% when not

including last year's one-time accounting change, which was

mentioned previously. Return on average stockholder's equity

(ROE) increased to 23.14% for the quarter, up from 19.18% for the

fourth quarter of 1992. Similarily, ROE for the year was 21.23%,

up from the pre-accounting change ROE of 15.78% for 1992. <PAGE>

"These results are consistent with our expectations," said John

C. Seramur, president and chief executive officer of First

Financial. "We have worked to improve in a number of key areas.

These improvements should help carry our earnings momentum into

1994." Seramur attributes the improved performance to an

increasing net interest margin, reductions in non-performing

assets, increases in non-interest income and the 1993

acquisitions.

Net interest income for the quarter rose to $39.7 million, up

from $32.6 million for the fourth quarter of last year. For the

year, net interest income was $150.4 million, up from $115.0

million for 1992. Correspondingly, the company's net interest

margin for the year rose to 3.41%, up from 3.35% for 1992.

During 1993, the company realized significant increases in non-

interest income. These increases are the result of contributions

from 1993 acquisitions, repricing strategies implemented by the

company in 1992-1993 and gains on sales of mortgage loans in the

normal course of business. These gains are fueled by the

increased demand for fixed-rate mortgages to purchase and

refinance homes in today's low interest rate environment. In

1993, First Financial originated a record $1.0 billion in

mortgage loans. The company also registered record production in

other lending areas such as credit card, home equity, and

consumer loans.<PAGE>

Non-interest expenses continued to show improvement in the fourth

quarter and year-end 1993. Non-interest expenses compared to

average total assets in the fourth quarter declined to 2.18%,

down from 2.33% for the fourth quarter of last year. For the

year, the ratio was 2.29%, down from 2.46% for 1992. In addition,

the company's efficiency ratio, which represents controllable

non-interest expenses as a percentage of core income before

expenses, improved to 51% for the three months ended December 31,

1993, down from 53% for the same period last year. For the year,

the efficiency ratio improved to 53%, down from 56% for 1992.

The company continues to maintain excellent asset quality. Non-

performing assets declined to $15.1 million, down substantially

from $29.9 million at the end of 1992. As a percentage of total

assets, non-performing assets were .32%, down from .76% at the

end of last year. Meanwhile, allowances for loan losses, as a

percentage of non-accrual loans, increased to 282%, up from 109%

at this time last year.

Stockholder's equity increased to $234.7 million, up from $194.1

million at the end of last year. Book value per share at year-end

stood at $9.95, up from $8.34 at the end of last year.

In October of 1993, First Financial announced its intention to

purchase NorthLand Bank of Wisconsin, SSB, headquartered in

Ashland, Wisconsin. The transaction is subject to regulatory

approval and approval by NorthLand shareholders. It is expected<PAGE>

to close during the first quarter of 1994. Upon closing,

NorthLand's offices will become branches of First Financial Bank.

First Financial Corporation is the holding company for First

Financial Bank, FSB, Wisconsin's largest thrift, and First

Financial-Port Savings Bank, FSB. The Corporation has $4.8

billion in assets and operates 117 banking offices in Wisconsin

and Illinois. The company's shares are quoted and traded on the

NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol FFHC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Quarter And Year Ended December 31, 1993

(1) On August 20, 1993, the Corporation's major subsidiary,
First Financial Bank, FSB ("First Financial"), completed the
assumption of deposits (approximately $268.0 million) and
the purchase of the branch facilities of the four Quincy,
Illinois-area branches of Citizens Federal, a Federal
Savings Bank ("Citizens") of Miami, Florida. The
acquisition of Citizens' four Quincy, Illinois-area offices
was accounted for as a purchase.

(2) On January 4, 1993, First Financial acquired
Westinghouse Federal Bank, FSB, d/b/a United Federal
Bank ("United"), of Galesburg, Illinois for an
aggregate cash purchase price of approximately
$53.0 million from Westinghouse Financial Services,
Inc. and Westinghouse Savings Corporation. The
acquisition of United by First Financial has been
accounted for as a purchase with United's nineteen
branch offices now operating as branches of First
Financial. Prior to purchase accounting and post-
acquisition restructuring transactions, United had
total assets, deposit liabilities and stockholder's
equity of $820.5 million, $694.0 million and
$54.0 million, respectively.

(3) A 2-for-1 stock split, in the form of a 100% common
stock dividend, was distributed on March 5, 1993. All
numbers of shares and per share amounts have been
adjusted to reflect this distribution.

(4) A $5,600,000 credit, or $0.24 per share, was realized
in the first quarter of 1992 reflecting the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle as a result
of the implementation of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 (Accounting for Income
Taxes).

(5) Core earnings represent net income before the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle as offset by the
after-tax effect of significant non-recurring transactions
(i.e., primarily net gains on sales of assets).

(6) Annualized data, as applicable.
