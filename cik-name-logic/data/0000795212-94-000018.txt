Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

Effective September 1, 1994, the Registrant's certifying accountant, 
the firm of Ernst & Young LLP, is selling their Albany, New York 
practice to another national firm, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP. At a 
meeting held on August 26, 1994, the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors approved the engagement of KPMG Peat Marwick as its 
independent auditors for the fiscal year ending January 28, 1995, to 
replace the firm of Ernst & Young, which declined to stand for 
reelection as auditors of the Registrant, effective immediately.

Ernst & Young has been the Registrant's auditors since the 
Registrant's initial public offering in 1986. The reports of Ernst & 
Young on the Registrant's financial statements for the past two 
fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of 
opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit 
scope, or accounting principles.

In connection with the audits of the Registrant's financial 
statements for each of the two fiscal years ended January 29, 1994,
and in the subsequent interim period, there were no disagreements on
any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope and procedures which, if not resolved 
to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused Ernst & 
Young to make reference to the matter in their report.

The Registrant has requested Ernst & Young to furnish it a letter 
addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the 
statements set forth above in this Item 4. A copy of that letter, 
dated August 31, 1994, is filed herewith as Exhibit 16.1 to this 
Current Report on Form 8-K.
