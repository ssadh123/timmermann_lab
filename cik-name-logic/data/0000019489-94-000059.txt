CHASE REPORTS EARNINGS OF $305 MILLION FOR THIRD QUARTER 1994,
$976 MILLION FOR FIRST NINE MONTHS 1994

The Chase Manhattan Corporation today reported third quarter 1994 net
income of $305 million ($1.49 per share), up 14% from the $267 million
($1.25 per share) reported for the third quarter of 1993.

Thomas G. Labrecque, Chairman said, "Our solid performance for the quarter,
in light of highly competitive markets in many of our businesses,
demonstrates the strength and diversity of our core franchises."

Third Quarter Highlights - 1994 vs. 1993:
- return on common equity of 15.8% versus 15.1%;
- continued strong growth in fees and commissions - up 13%, including
consumer banking - up 40% and trust and fiduciary - up 16%;
- trading revenue of $188 million;
- a lower provision for possible credit losses of $100 million, down
$115 million;
- continued decline of nonperforming assets, including a 16% decrease in
domestic commercial real estate nonperforming assets during the
quarter;
- the announcement of a voluntary early retirement program that is
estimated to achieve annual expense reductions of $55 million,
beginning in 1995.

<PAGE> 2 
For the first nine months of 1994, Chase reported consolidated net income
of $976 million ($4.76 per share), up 49% from the $653 million ($3.23 per
share) reported for the same period of 1993.

During the third quarter of 1994, as part of the common stock repurchase
program announced in June 1994, Chase repurchased 4 million shares of its
common stock, which favorably impacted the earnings per share amounts.

NET INTEREST REVENUE - TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS
Net interest revenue, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $922 million for
the third quarter of 1994, compared with $926 million for the third quarter
of 1993. Net interest margin was 3.81%, compared with 3.99% reported for
the third quarter of 1993. Average interest-earning assets increased to
$95.9 billion from the $92.1 billion level reported for the third quarter
of last year. Average loans were $60.0 billion for the current quarter,
compared with $61.7 billion for the third quarter of 1993.

For the first nine months of 1994, net interest revenue, on a taxable
equivalent basis, was $2,803 million, compared with $2,884 million for the
same period last year, which included $142 million of interest revenue from
Brazil PDI bonds. The net interest margin was 3.97% for the first nine
months of 1994, compared with 4.33% (4.12% excluding Brazil PDI bonds) for
the same period last year. Average interest-earning assets for the first
nine months of 1994 were $94.5 billion, compared with $89.0 billion for the
first nine months of 1993. For the first nine months of 1994, average
loans were $60.6 billion, compared with $61.2 billion reported for the same
period last year.

<PAGE> 3
Fees and commissions were $458 million for the third quarter of 1994, up
13% over the third quarter of 1993. For the first nine months of 1994,
fees and commissions were $1,384 million, up 19%, reflecting increases in
all major categories of fee revenue.

Total consumer banking fees, including credit card and mortgage banking
fees, increased 40% over the third quarter of 1993 and 35% over the first
nine months of last year. Mortgage banking fees improved substantially
over the same periods of 1993 primarily due to the absence of accelerated
writedowns of mortgage servicing assets in 1994.

Trust and fiduciary fee revenue increased 16% and 24% over the third
quarter and first nine months of 1993, respectively, primarily due to
increased customer transaction volumes in the Global Securities Services
business.

While investment banking fee revenue declined $8 million from the third
quarter of 1993, such fees for the first nine months of 1994 increased 15%
over the same period last year.

</TABLE>

Total trading revenue was $188 million, essentially unchanged from the
third quarter of last year, as strong results from emerging markets
trading activities more than offset the decline in foreign exchange and
derivative trading revenue.

For the first nine months of 1994, total trading revenue was $519
million, compared with $549 million for the same period last year.

</TABLE>

Total other revenue for the third quarter of 1994 was $81 million, compared
with $128 million for the same period in 1993, due to a reduction in gains
from the accelerated disposition portfolio and corporate finance-related
equity transactions.

Total other revenue for the first nine months of 1994 totaled $478 million,
up $115 million, or 32%, from $363 million for the first nine months of
1993.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Total operating expenses were $1,067 million for the third quarter of 1994
and $1,025 million for the third quarter of 1993. Compared with the same
period last year, operating expenses for the third quarter of 1994
reflected higher performance related compensation as well as increased
payroll and other costs related to the expansion of Chase's businesses.
Chase's results have begun to reflect the benefit of accelerated business
investments. In particular, in Chase's transaction based information
services business, revenue growth is more than covering increased
expenditures. In addition, operating expenses for the third quarter of
1994 included $6 million from the recent acquisition of American
Residential Holding Co., a mortgage origination and servicing business.

For the third quarter of 1994, operating expenses were favorably impacted
by $24 million in net ORE revenue, compared with $31 million of net ORE
expenses for the same period last year. The expense to revenue ratio was
65% (66% excluding ORE) for the current quarter.

<PAGE> 5
For the first nine months of 1994, other operating expenses were $3,197
million, compared with $3,003 million (excluding first quarter 1993
provision for ORE held for accelerated disposition) for the same period of
1993.

Yesterday, Chase announced a Voluntary Retirement Program which will be 
offered during the fourth quarter to approximately 2,600 eligible employees. 
Based on assumptions concerning the anticipated levels of participation by
employees, Management estimates that the annual savings in salary and
related benefits would be approximately $55 million per year, beginning in
1995. Based on these assumptions, the cost of the program to Chase is
estimated at $100 million (pre-tax) which will be reflected in the fourth
quarter of 1994 when actual employee acceptance is known. Together with
other anticipated fourth quarter items, such as the gain from the previously
announced sale of Chase Florida, the impact on earnings is not expected to
be material. 

INCOME TAXES
The third quarter of 1994 provision for income taxes was $171 million,
compared with a tax provision of $132 million for the third quarter of
1993.

For the first nine months of 1994, the provision for income taxes was $583
million, compared with $93 million for the same period last year.
Excluding the tax benefits applicable to the special provision for the
accelerated disposition portfolio, Chase's tax provision for the first nine
months of 1993 would have been approximately $403 million. In addition,
Chase adopted SFAS 109 in the first quarter of 1993 resulting in a $500
million net benefit reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle.

The effective tax rates were 36% and 37% for the third quarter and first
nine months of 1994, respectively.

<PAGE> 6
PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES AND NET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS
The provision for possible credit losses was $100 million, or $50 million
lower than the second quarter of 1994 and $115 million lower than the third
quarter of last year.

Net loan charge-offs were $119 million, down $97 million from the third
quarter of 1993. Domestic commercial real estate net loan charge-offs were
$21 million for the third quarter of 1994 and are covered by the existing
reserve allocated to the noncore domestic commercial real estate portfolio.

DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS
Chase continues to reduce its exposure to real estate. During the third
quarter of 1994, domestic commercial real estate assets decreased $321
million to $2.7 billion at September 30, 1994. Contributing to this
decline were approximately $296 million of net repayments and sales of
outstanding assets, and $25 million of charge-offs.

(a) On January 1, 1994, Chase adopted FASB Interpretation No. 39. As a
result of such adoption, Chase's Trading Account Assets and
Liabilities increased approximately $11 billion at September 30, 1994
and $13 billion at June 30, 1994. This had the effect of decreasing
the common and total equity ratios and the Tier I leverage ratios.
(b) Adjusted to reflect the redemption of all $227 million of Chase's
outstanding Series F Preferred Stock, announced on May 10, 1994.
(c) Total risk-based capital adjusted to reflect the redemption of all
$350 million of Chase's outstanding Floating Rate Subordinated Notes
Due 1995, in October 1993.
