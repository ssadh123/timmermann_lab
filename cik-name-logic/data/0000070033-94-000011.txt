Item 1-4. Not Applicable

Item 5. Other Events

The Registrant closed four acquisitions during the period beginning June 1,
1994 and ending October 26, 1994. None of these transactions was material.
Each is described below.

On June 1, 1994, the Registrant acquired certain assets and liabilities of Yes
Check Services, Inc. (hereinafter "Yes Check"). These assets and
liabilities were purchased directly from Yes Check. The assets and liabilities
are used in a Chicago-based check guarantee business.

Effective September 2, 1994, the Registrant acquired a Chicago-based check
guarantee business through the purchase of all of the capital stock
of Mercantile Systems, Inc. (hereinafter "Mercantile"). The stock was
purchased from the individual shareholders of Mercantile, a group of
approximately 13 persons.

On July 15, 1994, the Registrant acquired substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of Lytec Systems, Inc. (hereinafter "Lytec"), a Salt Lake City,
Utah-based physician and dental practice management software development
company. The assets and liabilities were bought by the Registrant from Lytec.

Effective October 26, 1994, the Registrant acquired all of the capital stock
of Zadall Systems Group, Inc. (hereinafter "Zadall"), a Vancouver, British
Columbia-based pharmacy and dental practice management software development
company. The stock was purchased from the individual shareholders of Zadall.
The principal shareholders were Barry Guld and Mark Lyle.

The aggregate price paid for these acquisitions was $36,177,000 plus future
earn-out payments required for both the Yes Check and Lytec transactions. These
subsequent payments are not estimable at this time. Cash from internally
generated funds was used to finance $33,171,000 of the purchase price and
non-negotiable installment notes in the amount of $3,006,000, payable over
3 years, were issued to finance the remainder. The net value of the tangible
assets acquired was $3,096,000 creating an excess of cost over tangible assets
acquired of $33,081,000.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Boards of Directors
Yes Check Services, Inc.
and Select Check, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Yes Check Services,
Inc. and Select Check, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and the related combined
statements of operations and cash flows for the period from February 1, 1993,
date of inception, through December 31, 1993. These combined financial
statements are the responsibility of the management of Yes Check Services, Inc.
and Select Check, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
combined financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of Yes Check
Services, Inc. and Select Check, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and the
combined results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from
February 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared assuming that
Yes Check Services, Inc. and Select Check, Inc. will continue as going concerns.
As discussed in note 7 to the financial statements, the 1993 loss from
operations and the net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about the
combined entities' ability to continue as going concerns. Management's plans
with regard to these matters are also described in note 7. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.

YES CHECK SERVICES, INC. AND SELECT CHECK, INC.

Notes to Combined Financial Statements

December 31, 1993

( 1 ) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Principles of Combination

The combined financial statements include the accounts of Yes Check Services,
Inc. and Select Check, Inc. Yes Check Services, Inc. was incorporated in Iowa on
December 31, 1992 for the purpose of acquiring certain assets of the Yes Check
Division of Cherry Payment Systems, Inc. for $100,000 in cash, issuance of
$41,900,000 of senior subordinated notes, and assumption of a $236,515 capital
lease obligation. Select Check, Inc. was formed in March 1993. Yes Check
Services, Inc. and Select Check, Inc. (collectively "the Company") provide check
guarantee services at point-of-sale primarily to small and medium size merchants
located throughout the United States.

(b) Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on
furniture, fixtures, and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

(c) Prepaid Expenses

Prepaid expenses consist primarily of prepaid sales commissions. Prepaid sales
commissions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the service
contract, typically one year.

(d) Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of the value of the Company's merchant customer base
and its credit database. The merchant customer base and the credit database are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 6 and 7 years,
respectively.

(e) Income Taxes

The Company has elected subchapter S corporation status with the Internal
Revenue Service under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result,
virtually all of the Company's income, deductions, and credits are passed
through to the Company's sole shareholder for Federal income tax purposes. State
and local tax jurisdictions do not uniformly recognize S corporation status.
Accordingly, the Company will continue to be liable for state and local
income taxes in certain of these jurisdictions.

(2) Related-party Transactions

Select Insurance Associates, Ltd., an affiliate, markets the Company's check
guarantee services. Amounts due from Select Insurance Associates, Ltd. at
December 31, 1993 amounted to approximately $17,000.

The Company rents office space from Illinois Capital Group, Inc., an affiliate,
on a month-to-month basis at a rate of approximately $8,000 per month.
Management believes that these rentals are comparable with rentals which
could be negotiated with third parties on an arm's length basis. Amounts due to
Illinois Capital Group amounted to approximately $8,300 at December 31, 1993.

(3) Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment consists primarily of office furniture,
office equipment, computer software, and computer equipment. The computer
equipment is being leased under a capital lease through August 1995 and is
carried at a cost of $211,000 with accumulated depreciation of $59,526 at
December 31, 1993.
<PAGE>

( 4 ) Intangible Assets

In connection with the Company's acquisition of certain assets of the Yes Check
Division of Cherry Payment Systems, Inc. (Cherry), the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired amounted
to $41,650,806, of which $36,000,000 was attributed to the value of the
Company's merchant customer base, and the remaining $5,650,806 was attributed to
the database of credit history compiled by the Company. During 1993,
the Company wrote off $18,000,000 relating to the merchant customer base after
management determined that the value of this intangible asset was significantly
impaired as a result of various actions by Cherry which occurred prior to the
acquisition.

( 5 ) Notes Payable

Notes payable as of December 31, 1993 consist of the following:

Senior Subordinated Promissory Note
bearing simple interest at 18% $ 4,817,747

Senior Subordinated Promissory Note
bearing simple interest at 7% $ 37,000,000
-------------
Notes payable $ 41,817,747

Combined monthly principal and interest payments on the notes amount to $300,000
through February 1, 1994, $400,000 through February 1, 1995, and $500,000
thereafter, until fully paid. All of the Company's stock has been pledged as
security for the notes payable. Since October 1993, the Company has failed to
make the required principal and interest payments on the notes as they came due,
and remains in default under the terms of the notes as of December 31, 1993. As
a result, the notes payable have been classified as current liabilities in the
financial statements.

(6) Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain computer equipment through capital leases. Future
minimum lease capital lease payments as of December 31, 1993 are as follows:

Year Ending December 31,
1994 $ 107,124
1995 71,416
----------
Total Minimum Lease Payments $ 178,540

Less amount representing interest (17,641)
----------
Present Value of net minimum
capital lease payments 160,899

Less current installments of
obligations under capital leases (92,628)
-----------
Obligations under capital leases,
excluding current installments $ 68,271

<PAGE>
(7) Liquidity

During 1993, the Company incurred net losses of $22,429,556. At December 31,
1993 the Company's current and total liabilities significantly exceeded its
current and total assets. These conditions indicate that the Company may
experience difficulty in meeting its obligations to its existing single debt
holder. Except for the obligation to such single debt holder, the Company has
sufficient operating cash flow to meet all its other obligations in a timely
manner.

Management is currently attempting to sell the business. In the event it is
unsuccessful in selling the business, management intends to negotiate a
recapitalization of the Company with its single debt holder.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31. 1993 AND 1992

1. BUSINESS--ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The Company provides check-guarantee services to companies and individuals
operating in automotive, car repair and retail businesses throughout the United
States. Significant accounting policies of the Company are as follows:

Revenues

Commission income is based on a percentage of the dollar amount of each check
guaranteed. Service charges are received on all checks for which the Company is
required to reimburse the merchant for each warranty claim presented. Interest
income relates to interest earned from finance charges on outstanding accounts
receivable. Affiliation fees are derived annually from merchants who utilize
the check-guarantee service.

Warranty Claims

Warranty claims represent amounts owed to the Company by individuals for checks
they wrote to merchants which were guaranteed by the Company and were not
honored by the bank when presented. These claims are recorded net of
anticipated losses.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable of the Company at December 31, 1993 and 1992, consist of the
following:

1993 1992

Merchants $947,590 $713,886
Private label cards 4,979 79,488

============== ===========

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides depreciation
and amortization utilizing straight-line and various accelerated methods over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:

Asset Description Life

Office furniture and equipment 7-10 years
Data processing equipment 3-7 years
Transportation equipment 3 years
Leasehold improvements Lease term

<PAGE>
Basis of Presentation

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern
basis although, at December 31, 1993, the Company had a stockholder's deficit
and had current liabilities and total liabilities which exceeded its current
assets and total assets. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, meet its
obligations on a timely basis, obtain additional financing or refinancing as is
required (Note 2) and, ultimately, attain successful operations.

In the upcoming year, management's plan is to continue to increase check-
guarantee volume sales in new and existing markets. New selling techniques,
combined with improved authorization techniques started in prior years, will
continue to reduce warranty claim losses and allow penetration into new markets
with higher profit margins. The Company will continue to emphasize methods to
reduce direct costs, interest and selling expenses through a comprehensive cost
reduction program and seek additional equity financing In addition, the
Company expects to reduce losses through improved collection techniques. As a
result of these programs, management believes the Company will continue as a
going concern through December 31, 1994.

2. REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT:

In December, 1991, the Company entered into a financing agreement with a bank.
The agreement provides for a revolving line of credit limited to the lesser of
$949,000 or 80% of acceptable merchant and private label receivables (as
defined), plus up to 25% advance against acceptable warranty claims. Monthly
interest payments based upon the outstanding balance were made through December,
1992, at which time the outstanding balance was due. In addition, a $350,000
term loan collateralized by, and limited to, 100% of Instant Credit Service
(ICS) receivables was due and paid in full on December 31, 1992.

Since the expiration of the credit agreement on December 31, 1992, the Company
successfully negotiated with its bank to extend the terms of the previous credit
agreement through June, 1993, and again through December 31, 1993

At December 31, 1993, the revolver bore annual interest at the bank's prime rate
plus 2-1/2% (8.5%), was secured by the assets of the Company and was guaranteed
by the majority shareholder.

The Company must also meet certain financial covenants under the terms of the
agreements. As of December 31, 1993, the Company was in compliance with, or had
received waiver from, the lender for all covenant violations.

Subsequent to year-end, the Company modified and extended its financing
agreement through December 31, 1994. Under terms of the modified agreement, the
Company is required to make monthly principal payments of $15,625 through
February, 1994 (at which time payments based upon the Company's pretax net
income are required) and not make monthly debenture payments in excess of
$3,000. Also, amounts outstanding bear interest at the bank's prime rate plus
2-1/2%, and new financial covenants consist of maintaining tangible net worth of
$550,000 through June 29, 1994, and $700,000 through December 31, 1994, and
maintaining a debt to tangible net worth (as defined) of not more than 4:1
through June 29, 1994, and 3.9:1 through December 31, 1994.
<PAGE>

3. LONG-TERM DEBT:

following:

1993 1992
Installment note payable to a bank,
secured by equipment,
interest payable monthly at 8.0%,

------------------------
2,236,212 2,519,743
Less- Current maturities 228,869 1,117,774
------------------------
Total long-term debt $2,007,343 $1,401,969
========================

The Company issues renewable debentures to individuals and certain shareholders.
The debentures bear interest ranging from 7% to 11%. Interest and principal are
due upon maturity at various dates. Due to bank restrictions, only $36,000 of
principal payments can be made to these debenture holders in 1994. These
debentures are unsecured and subordinated to all secured debt of the Company.

4. DISCONTINUED INSTANT CREDIT OPERATIONS:

During 1991, the Company terminated its Instant Credit operations. Instant
Credit card applications were not accepted after January, 1991, although charges
were approved through April, 1991.

The Instant Credit operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations
in the accompanying statements of operations. The Company recorded a gain from
discontinued Instant Credit operations of $66,464 and $30,501 at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively Included in these amounts were net revenues of
$66,464 and $100,576; direct expense of $0 and $23,325; operating expenses of $0
and $46,750 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. There was no tax
benefit associated with the loss from discontinued operations.

5. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a discretionary profit-sharing plan covering all eligible
employees. Annual contributions are determined by the Board of Directors. No
contribution was made to the plan in 1993 or 1992.

<PAGE>

6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY:

In 1993, a director/shareholder exercised his option to acquire 50,000 shares of
the Company's stock at book value at the time of purchase. Also, in 1993, all
directors were each issued 1,000 shares of common stock valued at $1.50 in lieu
of cash for directors' fees.

In 1992, the Company sold 86,667 shares of its common stock for $1.50 per share
and the majority shareholder exchanged $238,690 of subordinated debentures for
159,246 shares of common stock.

7. INCOME TAXES:

Effective January 1, 1991, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (FAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes," which was issued in
February, 1992. There was no cumulative effect of adopting this new accounting
principle.

At December 31, 1993, the Company has available for federal income tax purposes
cumulative net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4,100,000. The
tax net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2003. As permitted
under FAS 109, the Company reflected a valuation allowance for the benefit of
the tax net operating loss carryforward in 1992. In 1993, the Company reduced
its valuation allowance as a result of current and projected taxable income and
a corresponding credit was recorded in the accompanying statement of operations.
Differences between financial reporting and federal taxable income relate
primarily to the timing of deductions for the provision for bad debts,
methods of financial and tax depreciation and the timing of deductions for
accrued vacation.

8. ANTICIPATED CLAIMS:

Historically, the Company had not given consideration to unrecognized claims
associated with checks which have been guaranteed. In an effort to better match
its revenues and associated costs, the Company has accrued the anticipated
claims which it estimates will be presented by merchants based upon the
volume of checks guaranteed and historical claim data. The effect of recording
the anticipated claims at December 31, 1991, has been accounted for as a prior-
period adjustment and resulted in a charge to retained earnings of $267,000. An
accrued liability for anticipated claims of $581,000 and warranty claims, net of
anticipated losses of $314,000, are recorded in the accompanying balance sheets.

9. LEASES:

The Company has entered into leases for its computer equipment, phone system and
office/warehouse facility. Under the terms of the current office and warehouse
facility lease, which expires in November, 1997, the Company is responsible for
utilities, insurance and maintenance. The Company also has an option to renew
for an additional five years at a base rental adjusted for increases in the
cost-of-living index. Total expenses under these leases, excluding utilities,
insurance and maintenance, for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, were
$111,790 and $177,282, respectively.

Future minimum annual lease payments by year are as follows:

Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)

The following pro forma financial information has been prepared as if
the acquisitions transactions reported had taken place on August 31, 1994
for the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and June 1, 1993 for the
pro forma condensed consolidated income statement. The pro forma results
presented are unaudited and reflect estimates for differences in year end.

All acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method. Goodwill
and intangibles resulting from these acquisitions will be amortized over periods
not exceeding 20 years. The purchase price allocations are estimated at this
time. Any adjustments to the purchase price are not expected to be material to
the pro forma financial information taken as a whole.

The pro forma financial information is presented for information purposes only
and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have
occurred had the acquisitions taken place on June 1, 1993, nor are they
necessarily indicative of future operations. The pro forma financial
information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.

ACCOUNTANTS' CONSENT

The Boards of Directors
Yes Check Services, Inc.
and Select Check, Inc.

We consent to the incorporation by reference in the registration statements
of National Data Corporation's file Nos. 2-81717, 2-86961, 2-92193,
33-25635, 33-43005, 33-44858, 33-58622 and 33-58624, on Form S-8, of our
report dated March 18, 1994, with respect to the combined balance sheets
of Yes Check Services, Inc. and Select Check, Inc. as of December 31, 1993,
and the related combined statements of operations and cash flows for the
period from February 1, 1993, date of inception, through December 31, 1993,
which report appears in the Form 8-K of National Data Corporation dated
November 17, 1994.

Our report dated March 18, 1994, contains an explanatory paragraph that
states that the 1993 loss from operations and the net capital deficiency
raises substantial doubt about the combined entities' ability to continue
as going concerns. The combined financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
