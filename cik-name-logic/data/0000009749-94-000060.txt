TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 1994

BANKERS TRUST REPORTS FIRST QUARTER NET INCOME OF $164 MILLION,
$1.90 PER SHARE; 15% RETURN ON EQUITY

Bankers Trust New York Corporation earned $164 million for the
three months ended March 31, 1994, or $1.90 primary earnings per
share. In the first quarter of 1993, the Corporation earned $230
million before cumulative effects of accounting changes, or $2.64
primary earnings per share. 

"This quarter illustrates the underlying strength of Bankers
Trust's franchise. Our $164 million of earnings and 15% return
on equity in what many have characterized as one of the most
difficult trading environments in a long time are testimony to
the Firm's diversity and earnings power, particularly in its
strong and growing client-related businesses," said Chairman
Charles S. Sanford, Jr. The Corporation's noninterest revenue
for the quarter, excluding trading revenue, increased by 27% over
the first quarter of 1993 and by 17% over the fourth quarter of
1993.

Revenue
Net interest revenue totaled $370 million, up $70 million, or
23%, from the first quarter of 1993. This increase was due
primarily to higher trading-related net interest, reflecting a
14% increase in average interest-earning assets, most of which
related to trading strategies. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

The Corporation views trading revenue and trading-related net
interest revenue in combination, as quantified below (in
millions):

Trading- 
Related 
Net 
Trading Interest 
Revenue Revenue Total 

First Quarter 1994 $ 14 $177 $191 

First Quarter 1993 $346 $117 $463 

The $272 million decrease in this combined total from the first
quarter of 1993 was primarily attributable to sharply lower
revenue from proprietary trading and positioning activities. The
main areas of reduced revenue were sovereign bond trading,
foreign exchange trading and the trading of emerging markets debt
and equity issues. Partially offsetting this decline was higher
revenue from the Firm's client risk management activities. 

Fiduciary and funds management revenue totaled a record $188
million for the first quarter, up $29 million, or 18%, from the
same period last year. Continued growth in private banking
assets under management contributed significantly to this
increase. Increases were also recorded by most other business
activities within this revenue category.

Fees and commissions of $182 million increased by $35 million, or
24%, from the equivalent period in 1993. Of this increase, $30
million related to corporate finance fees, which rose 38%, to
$108 million, led by increased loan syndication and debt
underwriting activities.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Other noninterest revenue totaled $117 million, up $39 million
from the prior year's quarter. This increase was due to higher
insurance premium revenue as well as increases in both equity in
income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and gains on sales of other
assets.

Expenses
Total noninterest expenses of $641 million decreased by $40
million from the first quarter of 1993. Incentive compensation
and employee benefits expense decreased $109 million, or 40%,
mostly due to lower bonus expense reflecting the reduced
earnings. Salaries expense increased $12 million, or 7%, from
the first quarter of 1993. The average number of employees
increased by 5% versus the same period, to 13,649.

All other expenses totaled $302 million for the quarter, up $57
million, or 23%, from last year's first quarter. Increases in
the provision for policyholder benefits, minority interest,
agency personnel fees and other real estate expense accounted for
most of this increase.

Asset Quality
The Corporation recorded $21 million of net recoveries and no
provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 1994. In the
prior year's quarter, net charge-offs of $121 million and a
provision for credit losses of $30 million were recognized.

Cash basis loans declined by $112 million, or 11%, to $862
million during the first quarter. The allowance for credit
losses at March 31, 1994 was $1.345 billion, representing 156% of
cash basis loans.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Effects of Accounting Changes
The Corporation adopted FASB Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting
of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts," effective January 1,
1994. The Interpretation requires that unrealized gains and
losses on swaps, forwards, options and similar contracts be
recognized as assets and liabilities, except where such gains and
losses arise from contracts covered by qualifying master netting
agreements. It was the Corporation's former policy to record
such unrealized gains and losses on a net basis on the balance
sheet. As the result of this adoption, at March 31, 1994 the
Corporation's consolidated total assets and total liabilities
each increased by $14 billion. 

As previously reported, in the first quarter of 1993, the
Corporation adopted accounting standards for postretirement
benefits other than pensions (SFAS 106) and postemployment
benefits (SFAS 112). The cumulative effects of adopting SFAS 106
and SFAS 112 totaled a charge of $75 million, equivalent to $.89
primary earnings per share. Net income for the first quarter of
1993 was $155 million, or $1.75 primary earnings per share.

Capital
The Corporation estimated that its ratios of Tier 1 Capital and
Total Capital to risk-adjusted assets were approximately 8.80%
and 14.50%, respectively, at March 31, 1994. The Leverage Ratio
was 5.39% at that same date.
