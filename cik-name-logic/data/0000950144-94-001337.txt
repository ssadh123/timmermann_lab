Debt Securities

Underwriting Agreement

July 18, 1994

BEAR, STEARNS & CO. INC.
245 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10167

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Regions Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation and formerly
known as First Alabama Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company"), proposes from time to
time to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement")
in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties
thereto may determine and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein
and therein, to issue and sell to the firm or firms named in Schedule I to the
applicable Pricing Agreement (such firm or firms constituting the
"Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities
specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified
in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (such Securities, as so specified in
such Pricing Agreement, being herein sometimes referred to as the "Designated
Securities"), less the principal amount of Designated Securities covered by
Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, as provided in Section 3 hereof and as may
be specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (such Designated
Securities to be covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, as so specified in such
Pricing Agreement, being herein sometimes referred to as "Contract Securities"
and the Designated Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters (after giving
effect to the deduction, if any, for Contract Securities) being herein
sometimes referred to as the "Underwriters' Securities").

The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated
Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and
in or pursuant to the indenture dated as of December 1, 1992 (such indenture,
together with any indentures supplemental thereto, being herein referred to as
the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company, as trustee
(the "Trustee").

1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made
from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom Bear,
Stearns & Co. Inc. will act as the representative (the "Representative"). This
Underwriting Agreement (the "Agreement") shall not be construed as an
obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of
any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The 

<PAGE> 2
obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities
shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated
Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall state the aggregate
principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering
price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of
such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated
Securities, the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased
by each Underwriter, whether any of such Designated Securities shall be covered
by Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined in Section 3 hereof), and the fee
payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date,
time, and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment
therefor. The Pricing Agreement also shall specify (to the extent not set
forth in the registration statement and the prospectus with respect thereto and
the Indenture) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement
shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts) and
may be evidenced by an exchange of facsimile transmissions. Each Pricing
Agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement by the Company and the
Underwriters to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. The obligations of
the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be
several and not joint.

2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees
with, each of the Underwriters that:

(a) The Company has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations adopted by the
Commission thereunder (the "Securities Act Rules"), a registration statement
(Nos. 33-45714 and 22-23176) on Form S-3, including a prospectus relating to
the Securities, and has filed such amendments thereto and such amended
prospectuses as may have been required by the Commission in order to enable the
Commission to declare such registration statement effective. Such registration
statement, including all exhibits, as the same may have been amended or
supplemented from time to time prior to the date of any Pricing Agreement, is
referred to herein as the "Registration Statement." Any preliminary prospectus
or preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities included as
part of the Registration Statement or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the
Securities Act is referred to herein as a "Preliminary Prospectus." The
prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it has most
recently been filed, or mailed for filing, with the Commission on or prior to
the date of this Agreement, is herein referred to as the "Prospectus." The
Registration Statement, as amended, has been declared effective under the
Securities Act by the Commission; and no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceeding
for that purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. Any
reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, or
the Prospectus shall be deemed to include the documents incorporated by
reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as
of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such
Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any
amendment or supplement to the

-2-
<PAGE> 3
Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus shall be
deemed to include any documents filed after the effective date of the
Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or
Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), and so incorporated by reference; and any
reference to the phrase "Prospectus as amended or supplemented" shall be deemed
to refer to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to describe the offering
of a particular series of Designated Securities in the form in which it is
first filed, or mailed for filing, with the Commission pursuant to an amendment
to the Registration Statement or Rule 424 under the Securities Act, including
any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing
or mailing;

(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus, when they were filed with the Commission, conformed in all material
respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
of the Commission thereunder (the "Exchange Act Rules"), and any further
documents so filed and incorporated by reference, when they are filed with the
Commission, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Rules;

(c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus
conform, and any amendments or supplements thereto will conform, in all
material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
where applicable, and the Securities Act Rules and the Exchange Act Rules, as
applicable, and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to
the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable
filing date as to the Prospectus and any supplement or amendment thereto,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall
not apply to any statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of
Designated Securities through the Representative expressly for use in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities; when the
Registration Statement became effective the Indenture was, and at all times
thereafter the Indenture has been, and will be, duly qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"); and when the
Registration Statement became effective the Indenture conformed, and at all
times thereafter the Indenture has conformed, and will conform, in all material
respects to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act;

(d) Any contract, agreement, instrument, lease, license,
document, arrangement, or understanding required to be described in, to be
filed as an exhibit to, or to be incorporated by reference into the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus has been described in, filed as an
exhibit to, or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as required by the Securities Act and the Securities Act Rules;

(h) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed,
and delivered on behalf of the Company; upon execution and delivery of each
Pricing Agreement by the Company, such Pricing Agreement shall have been duly
authorized, executed, and delivered on behalf of the Company and, when executed
and delivered by the Representative, will be a valid and legally binding
agreement of the Company in accordance with its terms; on the date of each
Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities covered thereby,
such Designated Securities shall be duly authorized and, when such Designated
Securities are authenticated as contemplated by the Indenture and issued and
delivered in accordance with this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement
applicable to such Designated Securities and, in the case of any Contract
Securities, pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts applicable to such Contract
Securities, will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued, and delivered
and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company in
accordance with their terms and will be entitled to the benefits provided by
the Indenture, which will be substantially in the form included as an exhibit
to the Registration Statement; and the Indenture has been duly authorized by
the Company and, as executed and delivered by the Company and the Trustee,
constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company in accordance
with its terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement

-4-
<PAGE> 5
rights generally and by general equitable principles, regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;

(i) In the event that any of the Securities are purchased
pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, each of such Delayed Delivery Contracts
has been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed and delivered on
behalf of the Company and duly authorized, executed and delivered on behalf of
the purchaser thereunder, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement
of the Company in accordance with its terms;

(j) There is no consent, approval, authorization, order,
registration, or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority
or other governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company which is
required for, and the absence of which would materially affect, the issue and
sale of any Designated Securities as contemplated by this Agreement or, in the

Indenture, except the registration under the Securities Act of the Securities,

consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations, or qualifications as may be
required under the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the public offering of the Securities by the Underwriters;

(k) Other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are
no legal, regulatory, governmental, or arbitration proceedings pending, or to
the best knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its

reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect upon the general affairs, financial position, net worth, or results of
operations (on an annual basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries considered
as a whole;

(l) The audited and unaudited financial statements
(including the related notes and schedules and any pro forma financial

Statement and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities
Act Rules, the Exchange Act, and the Exchange Act Rules, and said financial
statements present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of
operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the periods
specified. Such financial statements and related notes and schedules and pro
forma financial information have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved. The selected consolidated financial data, the tables and
financial and statistical data included in, or incorporated by reference into,
the

-5-
<PAGE> 6
Registration Statement and the Prospectus present fairly the information shown
therein and have been derived from, and are consistent with, the audited and
unaudited consolidated financial statements included in, or incorporated by
reference into, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The financial
statements and related notes and schedules and pro forma financial information
included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus conform to the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Commission
applicable thereto and present fairly the information presented therein for the
periods shown. The statistical information required by Commission Industry
Guide 3 ("Guide 3") to be included in, or incorporated by reference into, the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus presents fairly the information set
forth therein, is in compliance with the Securities Act, the Securities Act
Rules, and Guide 3, and is consistent with the Company's consolidated financial
statements incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus;

(m) Ernst & Young, who have certified certain of the
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, to
the best knowledge of the Company, are independent certified public accountants
as required by the Securities Act and the Securities Act Rules; and

(n) Since the respective dates as of which information is
given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, there has not occurred any material adverse change in, or any
development involving a prospective material adverse change in, or having a
material adverse effect upon, the general affairs, financial position, net
worth, or results of operations (on an annual basis) of the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated
in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

3. Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement
applicable to any Designated Securities and the authorization by the
Representative of the release of the Underwriters' Securities, the several
Underwriters propose to offer the Underwriters' Securities for sale upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented
and, in connection with such offer or the sale of such Designated Securities,
will use the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, together with any amendment
or supplement thereto, that specifically describes such Designated Securities,
in the form which has been most recently distributed to them by the Company,
only as permitted or contemplated thereby, and will offer and sell such
Designated Securities only as permitted by the Securities Act and the
applicable securities laws or regulations of any jurisdiction. The
Representative will use its best efforts to inform the Company when it has
authorized the sale of the Underwriters' Securities to the public and when it
has been advised that such Underwriters' Securities have been sold by the
several Underwriters within a reasonable period of time after such sales are
completed.

The Company may specify in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement
applicable to any Designated Securities that the Underwriters are authorized to
solicit offers to purchase Designated Securities from the Company pursuant to
delayed delivery contracts (herein called "Delayed Delivery Contracts"),
substantially in the form of Annex II attached hereto but with such changes
therein as the Representative and the Company may

-6-
<PAGE> 7
authorize or approve. If so specified, the Underwriters will endeavor to make
such arrangements, and as compensation therefor the Company will pay to the
Representative, for the accounts of the Underwriters, at the Time of Delivery
(as defined in Section 4 hereof), such commission, if any, as may be set forth
in such Pricing Agreement. Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, shall be with
institutional investors of the types described in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented and subject to other conditions therein set forth. The Company
will enter into a Delayed Delivery Contract in each case in which the
Underwriters have arranged for such a contract and the Company has advised the
Representative of its approval of the proposed sale of Contract Securities to
the purchaser thereunder; provided, however, that the minimum principal amount
of Contract Securities covered by any Delayed Delivery Contract (or the
aggregate amount under Delayed Delivery Contracts with related purchasers)
shall be $1,000,000, and the aggregate principal amount of all Contract
Securities shall not exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount specified in
Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities
specified therein, unless the Company otherwise shall agree in writing.
However, if the aggregate principal amount of Contract Securities requested for
delayed delivery is less than the minimum aggregate principal amount specified
in such Schedule II, the Company will have the right to reject all requests.
Each Underwriter to whom Contract Securities have been attributed will make
reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by the
purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Delayed Delivery Contract
covering such Contract Securities, but no Underwriter will have any liability
in respect of the validity or performance of any Delayed Delivery Contract.

The Company will notify the Representative not later than 3:30 p.m.,
New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Time of Delivery
specified in the applicable Pricing Agreement (or such other time and date as
the Representative and the Company may agree upon in writing), such notice to
be confirmed in writing prior to such Time of Delivery, of the principal amount
of Contract Securities and the name of, and principal amount thereof to be
purchased by, each purchaser. The principal amount of Contract Securities to
be deducted from the principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased
by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement
applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the principal
amount of Contract Securities of which the Company has been advised in writing
prior to the time of Delivery by the Representative as having been attributed
to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the
amount of Contract Securities to be so deducted shall be, in each case, that
proportion of Contract Securities which the principal amount of Designated
Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement
bears to the total principal amount of the Designated Securities (rounded, as
the Representative may determine, to the nearest $1,000 principal amount) and
that, subject to Section 8 hereof, the total principal amount of Underwriters'
Securities to be purchased by all of the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing
Agreement shall be the total principal amount of Designated Securities set
forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement, less the principal amount of the
Contract Securities.

-7-
<PAGE> 8
4. Underwriters' Securities to be purchased by each
Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto shall be
delivered (to the extent practicable) in definitive form or in the form of one
or more global securities, as specified in such Pricing Agreement by the
Company to the Representative, for the account of such Underwriter, against
payment of the purchase price therefor by such Underwriter or on its behalf, by
certified or bank cashier's check or checks, payable to the order of the
Company, or by wire or internal bank transfer to an account specified by the
Company, in the funds specified in such Pricing Agreement, all at the place and
time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and
time and date as the Representative and the Company may agree upon in writing,
such time and date being herein called the "Time of Delivery" for such
Securities. If any Underwriters' Securities are to be delivered in definitive
form, the Underwriters' Securities so delivered shall be in such authorized
denominations and shall be registered in such name or names as the
Representative shall request in writing at least forty-eight (48) hours prior
to the Time of Delivery. For the purpose of expediting the checking of such
Securities by the Representative, the Company agrees to make such Securities
available to the Representative not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the business day next preceding the Time of Delivery at the office of the
Representative as designated in Section II hereof. If any Underwriters'
Securities are to be delivered in global form, unless otherwise provided in the
applicable Pricing Agreement, the Underwriters' Securities as delivered shall
be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company (the
"Depository") and registered in the name of the Depository's nominee.

Concurrently with the delivery of and payment for the Underwriters'
Securities, the Company will deliver to the Representative for the accounts of
the Underwriters a check payable to the order of the Representative in the
amount of any compensation payable by the Company to the Underwriters in
respect of any Delayed Delivery Contracts as provided in Section 3 hereof and
in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities, or such amount may be
deducted from the amounts delivered pursuant to the preceding paragraph.

5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of
any Designated Securities:

(a) To make no amendment or any supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the
date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and prior
to the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities prior to having
furnished the Representative with a copy of the proposed form thereof and
having given the Representative a reasonable opportunity to review the same; to
file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements
required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section
13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented and for so long as the delivery of a
prospectus is required by law in connection with the offering or sale of such
Designated Securities and during such same period to advise the Representative,
promptly after it receives notice

-8-
<PAGE> 9
thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been
filed or became effective or any supplement to the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented or any amended Prospectus has been filed or mailed for filing, of
the issuance of any stop order by the Commission, of the suspension of the
qualification of such Designated Securities for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing
of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or
for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop
order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus
relating to such Designated Securities or suspending any such qualification, to
use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal;

(b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the
Representative reasonably may request in order to qualify such Designated
Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such states as
the Representative may request and to continue such qualifications in effect so
long as necessary under such laws for the distribution of such Designated
Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be
required to qualify as a foreign corporation to do business, or to file a
general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction, and provided further
that the expense of maintaining any such qualification more than one year from
the date of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities
shall be at the expense of the Underwriters;

(c) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the
Registration Statement (excluding exhibits) and copies of the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representative may from time
to time reasonably request; and if, before a period of six (6) months shall
have elapsed after the date of the Pricing Agreement applicable to such
Designated Securities and the delivery of a prospectus shall be at the time
required by law in connection with sales of any such Designated Securities,
either (i) any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, or (ii) for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same
period to amend or supplement the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or to
file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference into the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented in order to comply with the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, to notify the Representative and upon their request to
file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each
Underwriter and to any dealer participating in the distribution of such
Designated Securities as many copies as the Representative may from time to
time reasonably request of an amendment or a supplement to the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented which will correct such statement or omission or effect
such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required by law to deliver a
prospectus in connection with sales of any of such Designated Securities at any
time six (6) months or more after the date of such Pricing Agreement, upon the
request of the Representative, but at the expense of such Underwriter, to
prepare

request of an amended or supplemented prospectus complying with Section
10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;

(d) To make generally available to its security holders
as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than eighteen (18) months

and its consolidated subsidiaries complying with Rule 158 under the Securities
Act and covering a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months beginning
after such effective date;

reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission or
any national securities exchange on which any of the Securities or any class of
securities of the Company is listed, and (ii) such additional information
concerning the business and financial condition of the Company as the
Representative may from time to time reasonably request (such financial
statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent that the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its
security holders generally or to the Commission); and

(f) To pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses
incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including the cost of
all qualifications of such Designated Securities under state securities laws
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters in
connection with such qualifications and with legal investment surveys), any
fees of rating agencies with respect to the Securities, and the cost of
printing this Agreement, each Pricing Agreement and any Delayed Delivery
Contracts (it being understood that, except as provided in this subsection (f)
and in Section l0 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and
expenses, including the cost of printing any Agreement among Underwriters, the
fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of such Designated
Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers that
they may make).

6. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated
Securities under the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities
shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representative, to the condition
that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company

true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of
its obligations hereunder therefore to be performed, in all material respects,

terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under (in each case material to
the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole), or result in the

material to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole) upon any of
the property or assets of the Company pursuant to the terms of any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, guarantee, lease financing agreement,

amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made
by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities
(other than the financial statements and other accounting information contained
in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or
any further amendments or supplements thereto, or omitted therefrom, as

-12-
<PAGE> 13
to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Securities Act Rules; and the statements in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented in the sections thereof describing the Securities and the
Designated Securities are accurate and fairly present the information required
or purported to be shown;

(xii) Such counsel believe that the Registration
Statement (other than the financial statements and other accounting information
contained therein or omitted therefrom from, as to which such counsel need

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading;

Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities and

the financial statements and other accounting information contained therein or
omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), together

such proceedings are known by such counsel to be threatened or contemplated by
governmental authorities or threatened by others, other than as set forth or
contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and other than such
proceedings which, in their opinion, will not have a material adverse effect
upon the general affairs, financial position, net worth, or results of
operations (on an annual basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries considered
as a whole.

Such opinion may be made subject to the qualification that the enforceability
of the terms of the Indenture, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, and the
Designated Securities may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and by general equitable principles, regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

-13-
<PAGE> 14
(c) Alston & Bird, counsel to the Underwriters, shall
have furnished to the Representative their written opinion, dated the Time of
Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form satisfactory to the
Representative in its reasonable judgment, to the effect that:

(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is
validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware, with corporate power under the laws of such State to own, lease,
and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented and as presently conducted;

(ii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act, has been duly authorized, validly executed, and
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms;

(iii) The Designated Securities have been duly
authorized by the Company; the Underwriters' Securities, when executed by the
Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and
delivered and paid for as provided in this Agreement and the applicable Pricing
Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute
valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided
by the Indenture; and any Contract Securities (if executed by the Company and
authenticated by the Trustee as aforesaid), when delivered and paid for as
provided in the Delayed Delivery Contracts, will have been duly issued under
the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company
entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;

(iv) The documents incorporated by reference in
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements
and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein
or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when 
they were filed with the Commission, appeared on their face to be 
appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Exchange Act Rules;

(v) The Registration Statement has become
effective under the Securities Act, is still effective, and to the best
knowledge of such counsel, no proceedings for a stop order are pending or
threatened;

(vi) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus
as amended or supplemented and any further amendments or supplements thereto
made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities
(other than the financial statements and other accounting information contained
in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or
any further amendments or supplements thereto, or omitted therefrom, as to
which such counsel need express no 

-14-
<PAGE> 15
opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all
material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities
Act Rules;

(vii) The Indenture and the Designated Securities
conform with the descriptions thereof contained in the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in all material respects; and

(viii) Each of this Agreement and the Pricing
Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities have been duly authorized,
executed, and delivered by the Company.

Such opinion may be made subject to the qualification that the enforceability
of the terms of the Indenture and the Designated Securities may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws relating to or
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law.

(d) (i) At the time of execution of this Agreement,
Ernst & Young shall have furnished to the Representative a letter dated the
latest effective date of the Registration Statement; (ii) at the time of
execution of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities, Ernst &
Young shall have furnished to the Representative a letter dated the date of
such Pricing Agreement; and (iii) at the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities, Ernst & Young shall have furnished to the Representative a letter
dated such Time of Delivery; in each case in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Representative to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto and, with
respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as
the Representative reasonably may request as shall be referred to in Schedule
II to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities;

(e) Since the respective dates as of which information is
given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, there shall not have occurred any material adverse change, or any
development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting
the general affairs, financial position, net worth, or results of operations
(on an annual basis) of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole,
otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, which in any such case makes it
impracticable or inadvisable in the reasonable judgment of the Representative
to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated
Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

(f) Since the time of execution of the Pricing Agreement
applicable to the Designated Securities, the United States shall not have
become engaged in hostilities which have resulted in the declaration of a
national emergency or a declaration of war, which makes it impracticable or
inadvisable in the reasonable judgment of the

-15-
<PAGE> 16
Representative to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the
Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented; and

(g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be
furnished to the Representative, at the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities, certificates in form satisfactory to it in its reasonable judgment
to the effect that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of such Time of
Delivery as though made at and as of such Time of Delivery; (ii) the Company
has duly performed, in all material respects, all obligations required to be
performed by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement at or prior to such
Time of Delivery; (iii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has
been initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the
Commission and all requests for additional information on the part of the
Commission have been complied with or otherwise satisfied; and (iv) at and as
of such Time of Delivery the Registration Statement (and the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however,
that no such certificate shall apply to any statements or omissions made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
Company by an Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.

The obligations of the Company and the Underwriters of any
Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated
Securities are subject to the additional condition that there shall have been
furnished to the Company and such Underwriters, at the Time of Delivery for
such Designated Securities, such certificates of officers as, in the reasonable
judgment of the Representative and the Company, shall be appropriate to
indicate that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered
by the Trustee.

7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless
each Underwriter of the applicable Designated Securities against any losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter
may become subject with respect to such Designated Securities, under the
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the
Registration Statement, or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any
amendment or supplement thereto with respect to such Designated Securities, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such Underwriter for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability arises out of or is based upon

-16-
<PAGE> 17
an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated
Securities through the Representative expressly for use therein; and provided,
further, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter of
Designated Securities or any person controlling such Underwriter under the
indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any of such
documents to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability of such
Underwriter or controlling person results from the fact that such Underwriter
sold such Designated Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or
given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the
Prospectus or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding
documents incorporated by reference), whichever is most recent, if the Company
previously has furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter.

The indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) shall be in addition to
any liability which the Company otherwise may have and shall extend, upon the
same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
within the meaning of the Securities Act.

(b) Each Underwriter of the applicable Designated
Securities will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities to which the Company may become subject with
respect to such Designated Securities, under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any
preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, or the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any amendment or supplement thereto
with respect to such Designated Securities, or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any of
such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative
expressly for use therein and will reimburse the Company for any legal fees or
other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim.

The indemnity agreement in this subsection (b) shall be in addition to
any liability which the Underwriters otherwise may have and shall extend, upon
the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and
to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the
Securities Act.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) immediately above of written notice of the commencement
of any action, such indemnified party, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against the indemnifying party

-17-
<PAGE> 18
under such subsection, shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof, and in the event that such indemnified party shall not so
notify the indemnifying party within thirty (30) days following receipt of any
such notice by such indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall have no
further liability under such subsection to such indemnified party unless such
indemnifying party shall have received other notice addressed and delivered in
the manner provided in the second paragraph of Section 11 hereof of the
commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such
action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party in its reasonable
judgment, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party
shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7
is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) immediately
above in respect of any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated
Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which
such loss, claim, damage, or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.
If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is
not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute
to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated
Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the
other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds
from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to
the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters,
in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Securities. The
relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the Company or such Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission, including, with respect to any such Underwriter, the extent to

-18-
<PAGE> 19
which such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) result from the fact that such Underwriter sold such Designated
Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the
written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus or of the
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by
reference), whichever is most recent, if the Company previously has furnished
copies thereof to such Underwriter. The Company and the Underwriters agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters
were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to
include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages which such Underwriter otherwise has been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of
the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute
are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with
respect to such Securities and not joint.

8. If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to
purchase the Underwriters' Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the
Pricing Agreement applicable to such Securities, the Representative may in its
discretion arrange for themselves or for another party or other parties to
purchase such Underwriters' Securities on the terms contained herein. If
within thirty-six (36) hours after such default by any Underwriter the
Representative does not arrange for the purchase of such Underwriters'
Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of
thirty-six (36) hours within which to procure another party or other parties to
purchase such Underwriters' Securities on such terms. In the event that,
within the respective prescribed periods, the Representative notifies the
Company that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters'
Securities, or the Company notifies the Representative that it has so arranged
for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, the Representative or the
Company, respectively, shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery
for such Underwriters' Securities for a period of not more than seven (7) days
in order to effect whatever changes thereby may be made necessary in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any
other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented which in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters
referred to in Section 6(c) hereof and counsel for the Company referred to in
Section 6(b) hereof thereby may be made necessary. The term

-19-
<PAGE> 20
"Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted
under this Section with like effect as if it originally had been a party to the
Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. In the event
that neither the Representative nor the Company arranges for another party or
parties to purchase such Underwriters' Securities as provided in this Section,
the Company shall have the right to require each nondefaulting Underwriter to
purchase and pay for the Underwriters' Securities which such nondefaulting
Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such
Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each such nondefaulting
Underwriter to purchase the Underwriters' Securities which the defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters shall have so failed to purchase up to an amount
thereof equal to 10% of the principal amount of the Underwriters' Securities
which such nondefaulting Underwriter otherwise has agreed to purchase under the
Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities; provided, however,
that if the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities which any
such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters shall have so failed to purchase is
more than one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated
Securities, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities
may be terminated either by the Company or, through the Representative, by such
Underwriters as have agreed to purchase in the aggregate 50% or more of the
remaining Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such
Designated Securities, without liability on the part of any nondefaulting
Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses referred to in Section 5(f)
hereof and the indemnification provided in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein
shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

9. The respective indemnities, agreements,
representations, warranties, and other statements of the Underwriters and the
Company hereunder, as set forth in this Agreement or made by them,
respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and
effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results
thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of its
officers or directors or any controlling person, and shall survive delivery of
and payment for the Designated Securities.

10. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant
to Section 8 hereof, or if any Designated Securities are not delivered by the
Company because the condition set forth either in the last paragraph of Section
6 or in Section 6(g) has not been met, then the Company shall be under no
liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered
by such Pricing Agreement, except as provided in Section 5(f) and Section 7
hereof; but if for any other reason any Designated Securities are not delivered
by the Company as provided herein, the Company will be liable to reimburse the
Underwriters, through the Representative, for all out-of-pocket expenses,
including counsel fees and disbursements, as approved in writing by the
Representative, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations
for the purchase, sale, and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the
Company shall then have no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to
such Designated Securities, except as provided in Section 5(f) and Section 7
hereof.

-20-
<PAGE> 21
11. In all dealings with the Company under this Agreement
and each Pricing Agreement, the Representative of the Underwriters of
Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the
Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice,
or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representative.

of the most recent quarterly financials, except, in all instances, for changes
which the most recent report filed with the Commission containing financial
statements disclosed have occurred or may occur or which are described in each
such letter; or

[REVERSE SIDE]

This Note is issued under an Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1992,
(herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bankers Trust Company,
as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor
trustee under the Indenture), and represents the aggregate principal amount of
the duly authorized issue of the series of 7.65% Subordinated Notes Due 2001
issued by the Company under the Indenture (herein called "this Series"),
limited in aggregate principal amount to $25,000,000. Every reference herein
to Securities of this Series also applies specifically to this Note. Reference
is made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for the
declaration of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, and the holders of Securities of this Series and of the terms
upon which Securities of this Series are, and are to be, authenticated and
delivered.

The indebtedness evidenced by the Securities of this Series is
subordinate and junior in right of payment of principal and interest and in all
other respects to the Company's obligations to holders of "Senior Indebtedness"
of the Company. Senior Indebtedness is defined in the Indenture to include all
indebtedness and other obligations of the Company to its creditors, whether
outstanding on the date of execution of the Indenture or thereafter created,
assumed or incurred, including but not limited to (i) the principal of, and
premium, if any, and interest on all indebtedness for money borrowed, (ii) all
obligations to make payment pursuant to the terms of financial instruments
(including securities contracts, derivative instruments, option contracts and
similar financial instruments), (iii) any indebtedness or obligations of others
of the kind described in either (i) or (ii) above for the payment of which the
Company is responsible or liable as guarantor or otherwise, and (iv) any
deferrals, renewals or extensions of any such Senior Indebtedness, except
Subordinated Indebtedness. Securities of this Series are issued subject to the
provisions of the Indenture regarding subordination to Senior Indebtedness.
Each holder of this Note, and each owner of a beneficial interest in Securities
of this Series, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions, authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such
action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so
provided, and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes.

If an Acceleration Event (defined in the Indenture as certain events
involving bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or reorganization of the Company)
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this Series
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Indenture. The principal of the Securities of this Series may not be
declared due and payable upon an Event of Default (as 

<PAGE> 5
defined in the Indenture) other than an Event of Default which also
constitutes an Acceleration Event.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the holders of Securities of this Series to be
effected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with
the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities of this Series. The Indenture also includes
provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities of this Series, on behalf of the holders of all such
Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal and interest on the Securities
of this Series herein provided, and at the time, place and rate and in the coin
or currency herein prescribed.

Securities of this Series are initially issued only in the form of a
Global Security, and will not be exchanged for Securities in definitive
registered form except under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in
the Indenture. Securities of this Series are issuable in denominations of
$1,000 and integral multiples thereof, will not be redeemable by the Company,
in whole or in part, prior to the Date of Maturity and do not provide for any
sinking fund.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of a permitted
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
will treat the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner for
purposes of payment of principal and, subject to certain provisions in the
Indenture, interest, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
For any other purpose under the Indenture, the Company, the Trustee and any
agent of the Company and any agent of the Trustee shall treat a person as the
holder of such principal amount of the Securities of this Series as shall be
specified in a written statement of the Depository (or of a successor
depository under the Indenture) which is provided to the Trustee by the
Depository or successor depository.

This Note may be surrendered for registration of transfer, or
exchange, subject to the terms of the Indenture, at the Corporate Trust Office
of the Trustee in the City of New York, at the principal office of the Company
in Birmingham, Alabama, or at the office of a successor Security Registrar or
of a transfer agent as may be designated by the Company from time to time.

Gentlemen:

Regions Financial Corporation (formerly First Alabama Bancshares, Inc.) (the
"Company"), a corporation organized and existing under and pursuant to the laws
of the State of Delaware, proposes to issue and sell $25,000,000 face amount of
its subordinated notes (the "Notes"), under a trust indenture entered into
between the Company and Bankers Trust Company dated as of December 1, 1992
(the "Indenture").

In connection with this offer and sale, we have examined the following
documents and items:

The certificate of incorporation of the Company as most recently amended.

The by-laws of the Company as most recently amended.

The Indenture.

Such documents evidencing the actions taken to date by the stockholders of
the Company, the board of directors of the Company, and committees of the
board of directors, and such other documents and items as we have considered 
necessary and appropriate to review in order to render this opinion.

Based upon the foregoing and with regard to such legal considerations as we
deem relevant to this opinion, it is our opinion that, assuming (a) execution
and delivery of the Notes, (b) authentication of the Notes as provided for in
section 303 of the Indenture, and (c) payment for the Notes, the Notes will be
validly issued and will represent binding obligations of the Company.

The binding effect of the Indenture and the Notes may be subject to or 
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, 
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

We consent to the inclusion of this opinion as an exhibit to a current
report of the Company on Form 8-K, and to the incorporation by reference in the
registration statement of the Company on Form S-3, registration number
33-45714.
