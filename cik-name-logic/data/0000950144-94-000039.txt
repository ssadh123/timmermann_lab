NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. CONSUMMATED ACQUISITIONS

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statements of
earnings reflect the consummated and probable acquisitions listed below. The
unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives effect to these transactions at
September 30, 1993, as if they had occurred on that date, and the unaudited pro
forma consolidated statements of earnings reflect the impact of the
transactions as if they had occurred January 1, 1992. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated results shown are not necessarily indicative of future operating
results, nor can there be any assurance that the transactions will be
consummated. For the transactions accounted for as poolings of interests,
statements of earnings for periods prior to 1992 are not presented because the
transactions are not material to the consolidated results.

(a) The Corporation had previously acquired 17.93% of the common stock of
BOET ($3.4 million), and on January 1, 1993 purchased an additional
43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for 331,741 shares of
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective
May 3, 1993, the Corporation acquired the remaining outstanding common
stock of BOET for 317,045 shares of the Corporation's Series E
Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) The Corporation acquired Maryville, a mutual savings bank, which

exchange for a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1
million derived in part from the proceeds of an offering of the
Corporation's Common Stock made in connection with the
conversion/acquisition.

(c) The recording of the acquisition of Maryville using the purchase
method of accounting resulted in negative goodwill of approximately
$9.4 million, $8.1 of which was deducted from noncurrent, nonmonetary
assets (premises and equipment, fair value adjustment of loans,
prepaid software and mortgage servicing rights). The remaining
negative goodwill of $1.3 million was recorded in other liabilities
and is being amortized over 7 years.

The Corporation through Union Planters National Bank (UPNB) on March 27,
1992 assumed approximately $585 million in insured deposits/liabilities
(including accrued interest) of the former Metropolitan Federal Savings and
Loan Association. The purchase and assumption transaction was facilitated
through the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) which declared UPNB as the
successful bidder. UPNB also acquired approximately $82 million in assets and
received cash from the RTC totaling approximately $487 million. Pro forma
results for this transaction are not presented because Metropolitan Federal was
a failed financial institution.

SALES OF KENTUCKY BRANCHES OF SECURITY TRUST

The Corporation has entered into definitive agreements to sell six
Kentucky branches of Security Trust. The sales involve approximately $105
million of deposits, approximately $3 million of loans and approximately $1
million of premises and equipment. It is also expected that the transactions
will result in a reduction of Security Trust's goodwill and purchased mortgage
servicing rights. The sale of four of the branches has been completed (three
in Paducah and one in Clinton, Kentucky).

NOTE 6. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

The following summarizes the unaudited pro forma adjustments which are
necessary to reflect the transactions described previously as of September 30,
1993 for the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and as of January
1, 1992 in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of earnings. These
adjustments for probable acquisitions are based on currently available
information and could change significantly upon consummation of the
transactions. Not all purchase accounting adjustments are reflected because
certain information is not available; however, the amounts are not considered
material.
