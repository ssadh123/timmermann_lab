SCOTT HIRES THREE TOP EXECUTIVES
--------------------------------

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 31, 1994 -- Albert J. Dunlap, chairman and CEO of Scott
Paper Company, today announced the hiring of three new top executives as part 
of his corporate restructuring program. The trio are the first senior 
executives to join the Company since Mr. Dunlap's election by Scott's Board of
Directors.

According to Mr. Dunlap, "I am bringing in a team of seasoned business 
leaders to assist me in my efforts to lead Scott to a new level of prosperity.
These new executives will be instrumental as we restructure Scott and 
formulate our strategy to focus on and strengthen our core worldwide tissue 
business."

The following appointments will be effective in mid-June:

-- Russell A. Kersh, senior vice president, Finance and Administration. 
Mr. Kersh will oversee the Company's corporate administrative
functions, including Finance, Information Systems, Procurement, and
Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures.

-- John P. Murtagh, senior vice president and general counsel. Mr. 
Murtagh will supervise Scott's legal matters around the world,
Environmental Affairs and Government Relations.

-- Jack Dailey, vice president, Procurement, Distribution and Logistics.
Mr. Dailey will lead the Company's procurement efforts and will
coordinate distribution and logistics functions. He will report to
Mr. Kersh.

"I have worked with each of these gentlemen before and have personally 
witnessed their ability to successfully execute restructuring strategies," 
said Mr. Dunlap. "I am confident they will help me lead Scott to achieve a 
significant increase in shareholder value."

Mr. Kersh and Mr. Murtagh, along with senior vice president P. Newton 
White, vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer Basil L. 
Anderson, and a new worldwide consumer tissue leader, will be among the 
members of a new operating committee for Scott's core tissue business. This 
committee, headed by Mr. Dunlap, will be responsible for the key strategic and
operating decisions at Scott. Mr. J.R. Leaman, Jr. will continue as vice 
chairman and president of S.D. Warren.

Scott, the world's leading producer of sanitary tissue products, is a 
Fortune 200 company with approximately $5 billion in sales. Since Mr. Dunlap's
appointment, the Company has announced it is exploring strategic alternatives 
for its S.D. Warren printing and publishing papers business, and has seen its 
stock price climb approximately 25 percent.
