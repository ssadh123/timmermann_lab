ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

Interim Earnings Update

On October 25, 1994, Kemper Corporation (the "Company") announced its earnings
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 1994. A copy of the
Company's press release dated October 25, 1994 is attached hereto as Exhibit 20
and is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

(A) Financial statements of business acquired - not applicable.

(B) Pro forma financial information.

As previously reported, the Company, Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco") and KC
Acquisition, Inc. ("Acquisition"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Conseco,
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 26, 1994 (the "Merger
Agreement"), pursuant to which Acquisition would merge with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), and the Company as the surviving corporation would
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Conseco. On October 25, 1994, Conseco
announced that it will not complete the Merger prior to year-end 1994 and that
under the Merger Agreement, Conseco has until March 31, 1995 to complete the
transaction. In the same announcement, Conseco noted that the Merger is not
contingent on Conseco's sales of its equity interests in other life insurance
companies, although it is exploring such sales and any such sales may impact
the financing structure for the Merger. The following pro forma financial
information assumes no such sales.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and the year ended December
31, 1993 present the Company's results of operations as adjusted to give effect
to the Merger and certain related and other transactions as if they all
occurred on January 1, 1993. The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated
balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 presents the Company's financial position as
if the Merger and certain related and other transactions all occurred on June
30, 1994. If the Merger and such related and other transactions are
consummated, the Company's financial statements will reflect their effects only
from the date each such transaction occurs. No assurance can be given that the
Merger will be consummated as or when currently contemplated.

The Merger is being accounted for herein as a "purchase" under the purchase
method of accounting. All information contained in the pro forma financial
information relating to Conseco or its merger-related plans and assumptions
have been supplied by Conseco, and the Company does not have independent 
knowledge of portions of such information. Under purchase accounting, the total
purchase cost of the Company will be allocated by Conseco to the assets and
liabilities acquired by Conseco based on their relative fair values estimated
by Conseco as of the dates the transactions are closed, with any excess of the
total purchase costs over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired 

-3-

<PAGE> 4

less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed recorded as
goodwill. The cost allocations will be based on appraisals and other studies,
which are not yet completed. Accordingly, the final allocations will be
different from the amounts reflected herein. Although the final allocations
will differ, the Company has been informed that the pro forma information
herein reflects Conseco management's best estimates based on currently
available information.

The pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto previously filed
as part of the Company's most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K
and 10-Q. The pro forma information below is provided for informational
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the actual financial
position or results of operations of the Company would have been had the
transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor does it purport to
indicate the future financial position or results of operations of the Company.
Results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 1994 may not be
indicative of results of operations to be expected for a full year. The pro
forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions
believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, including assumptions with
respect to financing the Merger and Conseco's future business plans. There can
be no assurance that such information, assumptions and plans will not change
from those reflected in the pro forma financial statements and notes thereto.

ADJUSTMENTS

(1) Immediately following the closing of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), all
of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company's life
insurance subsidiaries (the "Life Companies") will be sold to a life
insurance subsidiary of CCP II Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of Conseco (the
"Life Company Dispositions"), and certain real estate interests currently
held by subsidiaries of the Company will be transferred to one or more of
CCP II Holdings' real estate acquisition subsidiaries (the "Real Estate
Transfers"). It is currently anticipated that the amount to be paid in
connection with the sale and transfers is $1,296.9 million in cash.
All accounts related to the Life Companies and real estate subsidiaries are
eliminated to reflect the sale and transfers. The difference between the
cash consideration and the net book value of the assets sold and transferred
is recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings.

(2) Eliminations between the Life Companies and real estate subsidiaries and
the remaining subsidiaries of the Company are reversed. They are chiefly
comprised of accounts and notes receivable, the related interest expense,
commissions received by Kemper Sales Company and Kemper Securities, Inc. on
the sales of life products, and fees for services provided by Kemper Service
Company.

(3) Subsequent to June 30, 1994, the Company signed a definitive agreement
to sell Investors Fiduciary Trust Company ("IFTC"), a 50%-owned subsidiary,
to State Street Boston Corporation ("State Street"). State Street plans to
exchange approximately 3 million shares of its common stock for the
Company's ownership interest in IFTC. Consummation of the transaction is
subject to certain regulatory actions and approvals.

Other assets have been decreased by $50.6 million to eliminate the
Company's investment in IFTC. A tax payable of $30.9 million has been
included in the adjustment to Other accounts payable and liabilities (see 
Note 12). Asset management income has been reduced by $4.8 million for 1993
and $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 1994 to eliminate the 
earnings of IFTC for those periods. The State Street common stock is not 
included in the pro forma financial statements since it is assumed such 
stock will be transferred to the Life Companies.

(4) Under "push down" accounting, when a major change in the ownership of a
company's voting stock occurs, the economic effect of that change should be
reflected (pushed down) in the financial statements of the acquired 
company. Accordingly, the total consideration paid by Conseco to acquire 
the Company (net of amounts paid by CCP II Holdings to purchase the assets
of the Life Insurance Companies and certain 

-9-
<PAGE> 10
real estate interests) are reflected as the new equity of the Company. 
As partial financing for the Merger, Conseco plans to borrow $350.0 million
under a senior subordinated note and will issue common stock which is
assumed to be valued at $343.8 million (such amount has been calculated 
based on the closing price and the average closing price of
Conseco common stock as of and for the 20 trading days ended 
October 26, 1994).

The merger consideration would consist of $2,298.2 million of cash and
$343.8 million of Conseco common stock. Goodwill of $1,321.1 million will
be recorded in connection with the Merger. The consideration per
equivalent share of the Company's common stock is (i) $56.00 per share, 
without interest, and (ii) the fraction (rounded to the nearest
ten-thousandth) of a share of Conseco common stock determined by dividing
$11.00 by the average closing price of Conseco common stock prior to the
Merger (such fraction to be not more than 0.2418 nor less than 0.1982).

The Company's historical Common stock, Additional paid-in capital,
Unrealized loss on foreign currency translation, Unrealized loss on
investments, Retained earnings and Treasury stock are eliminated and
replaced with the anticipated capital of Acquisition after the Merger.

(5) After the Merger, Conseco intends to invest all cash in short-term
investments.

(6) In order to finance a portion of the merger consideration, Acquisition
intends to issue $823.5 million of senior debt, as shown in the following
table. $79.4 million of the proceeds of the new debt issues will be used
to retire previously existing debt as follows: $24.1 million Notes
payable, $14.7 million Long-term debt and $40.6 million Convertible
debentures of subsidiary.

(a) Principal and interest under the Senior Tranche A Term Loan and the
Senior Tranche B Term Loan are repayable in quarterly installments of
varying minimum amounts over a seven year period.
(b) The Senior Bridge Loan is required to be repaid on the second
business day after the Effective Time. It is anticipated that
simultaneously with or immediately following the Effective Time, Kemper
Financial Services, Inc. ("KFS") will transfer all of the broker-dealer
businesses of KFS and all of the property and assets related thereto into a
new wholly owned subsidiary of KFS (the "KFS 

-10-
<PAGE> 11
Broker-Dealer Transfer"). As a result of the KFS Broker-Dealer Transfer,
it is expected that certain funds will be made available and that these 
funds will be used to repay a portion of the Senior Bridge Loan.

A change in interest rates on the borrowings summarized above of .5% would 
result in (i) an increase (or decrease) in pro forma interest expense of
$3.6 million and $1.8 million for 1993 and the six months ended June 30, 
1994, respectively, and (ii) a decrease (or increase) in pro forma net
income of $2.4 million and $1.2 million for the same respective periods.

As a result of the Merger, the debt issued by Acquisition is consolidated
herein.

(7) Acquisition is expected to pay debt issuance costs totaling $41.2 million,
of which $30.7 million is associated with the issuance of the $823.5
million debt and $10.5 million is associated with the $350.0 million debt
to be issued by Conseco, the proceeds of which will be subsequently
contributed to Acquisition. Balance sheet adjustments have been made to
Long-term debt and Additional paid-in capital for these amounts.
Acquisition is also expected to pay $14.8 million of other
acquisition-related costs. The Company is expected to pay $52.0 million of
severance and other costs.

(8) Other assets are decreased to reflect the elimination of the Company's
previously deferred debt issue costs since all existing debt is either
repaid or adjusted to fair value.

(9) Goodwill reflects the excess of cost of the Company over the net assets
acquired at the assumed acquisition date.

(10) Other accounts payable and liabilities are increased to reflect the
actuarially determined amount allocated to pension, postretirement and
postemployment benefit obligations.

(11) Other accounts payable and liabilities are increased to reflect the excess
of existing operating lease obligations over the fair value of such
obligations, based on current market rental rates. Other expenses are
decreased $4.3 million for 1993 and $2.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 1994 to reflect this change.

(12) All of the applicable pro forma adjustments made to the consolidated 
balance sheet and consolidated statements of operations are tax effected
at the appropriate rate. In addition, certain additional adjustments have
been made to the historical tax accounts including:

(i) The Company will recognize a net tax loss upon the Life Company
Dispositions and the Real Estate Transfers which can be carried back to
recover capital gains tax paid in previous years resulting in a tax

-11-

<PAGE> 12

receivable at the assumed Effective Time. The anticipated tax benefit is
$125.0 million.

(ii) A tax liability of $30.9 million was recorded for the IFTC
disposition.

(13) Shares of Series C preferred stock and Series D preferred stock that are
to remain outstanding after the Merger are transferred to minority 
interest. The $130.0 million par value of the shares has been decreased 
by $6.1 million to reflect fair value.

(14) The value of the Company's existing Long-term debt remaining after the
Merger is adjusted to reflect current interest rates ranging from 7.72% to
10.18% depending on maturity. Interest expense has been decreased by $2.7
million for 1993 and $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 1994.

(15) It is assumed that all holders of Series A preferred stock and Series E
preferred stock will convert such shares to the Company's common stock at
or prior to the Effective Time. Such conversions are assumed in the total
merger consideration.

(16) After the Merger, investment advisory services formerly provided by KFS to
the Life Companies and real estate subsidiaries will be provided by
Conseco Capital Management, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Conseco, or by the real estate subsidiaries. Asset management income has
been decreased by $10.5 million for 1993 and $2.4 million for the six

KEMPER CORPORATION REPORTS
THIRD-QUARTER AND NINE-MONTH RESULTS

LONG GROVE, IL (Oct. 25) -- Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KEM) today
reported operating earnings from continuing operations of $44.5 million, or
$1.12 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $32.8 million, or
$.69 per share, for the same period in 1993. In the 1994 period, operating
earnings included a benefit of $14.7 million after-tax, primarily from an
investment portfolio repositioning, and an after-tax charge of $2.9 million
relating to the planned merger of the company with Conseco, Inc.

For the third quarter of 1994, the company reported net income from
continuing operations of $14.3 million, or $.24 per share, compared with a net
loss of $118.8 million, or $3.24 per share, for the same period in 1993. These
results included net realized investment losses of $30.3 million in the third
quarter of 1994, compared with net realized investment losses of $151.6 million
in the 1993 period. The 1994 net realized investment losses were primarily from
a repositioning of the life insurance subsidiaries' investment portfolios. The
1993 realized investment losses primarily were related to the company's

provisions for real estate-related losses of $250.0 million pre-tax, or $184.7
million after tax.

Net income including discontinued operations for the third quarter of
1994 was $17.5 million, or $.34 per share, compared with $162.4 million, or
$4.05 per share, for the third quarter of 1993. The 1993 third-quarter results
included gains of $269.0 million from the sale of Economy Fire & Casualty
Company and the exchange of Kemper's reinsurance and risk management
subsidiaries for 17.4 million shares of Kemper common stock. Also in the 1993
third quarter, there was a $3.3 million benefit relating to a 1 percent
retroactive increase in the corporate income tax rate.

"Overall, I am pleased with these results," said David B. Mathis,
chairman and chief executive officer of Kemper Corporation. "The earnings
level becomes even more meaningful when you consider the unusual conditions
under which these results were generated. The complexity of the planned merger
transaction, including the lengthy third-party approval processes and the
overall distraction to our operations, added new challenges for our people who
already are facing industry-wide pressures in our core businesses."

NINE-MONTH RESULTS

For the first nine months of 1994, Kemper reported operating earnings
from continuing operations of $103.7 million, or $2.51 per share, compared with
$57.0 million, or $.96 per share, in the year-ago period. The 1994 period
included the previously mentioned $14.7 million benefit and a charge of $9.8
million after-tax relating to a proxy contest and the subsequent merger
process. The 1993 results included charges of $11.9 million related to the
company's adoption of new accounting rules.

For the first nine months of 1994, net income from continuing 
operations was $89.4 million, or $2.09 per share, compared with a net loss of
$160.3 million, or $3.78 per share, in the first nine months of 1993.

The 1994 period included realized investment losses of $14.3 million, or
$.42 per share. The 1993 period included realized investment losses of $217.3
million, or $4.74 per share.

Net income including discontinued operations for the first nine months
of 1994 was $95.1 million, or $2.26 per share, compared with $148.0 million, or
$2.95 per share, for the 1993 first nine months. The 1993 period includes the
previously mentioned third quarter realized gains on the divestiture of certain
nonstrategic businesses.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

The asset management segment reported nine-month 1994 operating earnings
of $57.4 million, or $1.68 per share, compared with $68.5 million, or $1.49 per
share, for the same period in 1993. The drop in earnings was caused by a
decrease in commissions earned due to reduced new sales and lower management
fees reflecting a decline in assets under management.

Assets under management totaled $65.4 billion at Sept. 30, down from
$69.3 billion at year-end 1993, but up slightly from June 30, 1994. The 1994
decrease is related to net redemptions of mutual funds and reductions in market
values of assets under management.

On Sept. 27, 1994, Kemper Financial Services, Inc. signed a definitive
agreement to sell its 50 percent interest in Investors Fiduciary Trust Company
to State Street Boston Corporation for approximately three million shares of
State Street common stock.

LIFE INSURANCE

The life insurance segment reported significantly higher operating
earnings of $101.7 million, or $2.97 per share, for the first nine months of
1994, compared with $62.9 million, or $1.37 per share, for the same period in
1993. The increased earnings were attributable primarily to increased spreads
on fixed-rate annuities and the positive impact

<PAGE> 4

KEMPER REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER, NINE MONTHS EARNINGS -- PAGE 4

of a repositioning of the life insurance segment's investment portfolio during
September. The repositioning resulted in a reduced level of amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs during the period. Earnings also benefited
from adjustments with respect to investments in collateralized mortgage
obligations as well as increasing yields from the fixed-maturity portfolio.

The segment reported net income of $63.2 million, or $1.84 per share,
for the first nine months of 1994, compared with net income of $31.1 million, or
$.68 per share, for the year-ago period. Net income included net realized
investment losses of $38.5 million for the 1994 period, compared with net
realized investment losses of $31.9 million for the year-ago period.

The third-quarter 1994 repositioning of the segment's investment
portfolio resulted in a realized investment loss of approximately $39.7 million
after-tax from sales of certain investment-grade corporate securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The $868.7 million of proceeds from the
sales, together with $325.0 million of cash and short-term investments, were
reinvested primarily in higher yielding U.S. Government guaranteed mortgage
pass-through securities.

SECURITIES BROKERAGE

The securities brokerage segment reported an operating loss of $3.0
million, or $.09 per share, in the first nine months of 1994, compared with a
loss of $6.4 million, or $.14 per share, for the year-ago period. The 1993
period included a $19.8 million after-tax supplemental addition to legal
reserves and a $5.5 million expense after-tax related to a change in accounting
principles.

The 1994 loss is primarily due to lower revenues reflecting the
industry-wide downturn in the retail brokerage business and uncertainties with
respect to the company's ownership. The segment began to address the downturn
early this year by refocusing the organization on key business opportunities. 
In addition, steps were taken to reduce

KEMPER REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER, NINE MONTHS EARNINGS -- PAGE 5

overhead costs. The full impact of these measures is not expected to be realized
until 1995. Additionally, despite recent competitive pressures, the segment
continues to work toward its long-term strategies to recruit brokers and to
expand into selected communities.

REAL ESTATE

The real estate segment reported a net loss of $2.5 million, or $.07 per
share, for the first nine months of 1994, down significantly from a loss of
$231.0 million, or $5.04 per share, for the first nine months of 1993. Included
in the 1994 period were realized investment gains of $22.6 million, compared
with realized investment losses of $185.4 million for the same period in 1993. 
The 1994 period included gains from the third-quarter sale of equity interests
in certain multifamily projects to a newly formed real estate investment trust.

Operating losses decreased to $25.1 million, compared with operating
losses of $45.6 million in the same period of 1993. This improvement was due
primarily to sales, refinancings and restructurings respecting certain joint
ventures that reduced the level of losses the company is required to record. 
This segment continues to manage the real estate portfolio to decrease risk and
reduce operating losses.

Kemper Corporation is a holding company with principal subsidiaries in
asset management, life insurance and securities brokerage.
