INTEREST RATE SWAPS AT GIBSON GREETINGS, INC. RESULTED IN
$3 MILLION REALIZED LOSS AND $14.5 MILLION
ADDITIONAL MARKET EXPOSURE

Gibson Greetings, Inc. announced today that as a result of
unauthorized transactions in connection with the Company's
program of interest rate swaps which had been entered into for
the purpose of hedging its debt in a falling interest rate
environment, the Company has incurred a realized loss of $3
million. The Company has entered into new swap agreements which
cap its exposure at an additional $24.5 million in place of the
open exposure under the prior swaps. The realized loss of $3
million is being offset against a deferred realized gain of $2
million from earlier swaps. The new swaps mature in June and
August 1995 and have a current market exposure of approximately
$14.5 million in addition to the realized loss. The swaps may be
liquidated at any time prior to maturity and the Company will
continue to review the desirability of liquidating them on an
ongoing basis. The Company has conducted an internal
investigation and believes it has addressed all exposures
resulting from the prior transactions. In addition, the Company
has asked outside counsel to conduct a thorough investigation.
