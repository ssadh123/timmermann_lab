THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC.
REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS;
ANNOUNCES ANNUAL MEETING

New York, New York -- October 18, 1994 -- The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.
(NYSE:BSC) today announced earnings for the company's first fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 1994.

Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 1995 was $35.5 million,
or 25 cents per share, versus $104.3 million, or 77 cents per share for
the comparable quarter last year. Revenues, net of interest expense for
the quarter ended September 30, 1994 were $433.6 million, versus $586.1
million for the comparable quarter a year ago.

The company stated that the results of the current quarter are a
reflection of the present market environment. While investment banking
revenues were down due to the low level of debt and equity underwriting
activity during the quarter, the correspondent clearing business,
institutional sales and private client services contributed to an 11.8%
increase in commission revenues. Revenue performance from the
derivatives, emerging markets and risk arbitrage areas also helped to
offset declines in other activities.

President and Chief Executive Officer James E. Cayne stated "I am
proud of the optimism and energy of the entire Bear Stearns team in
meeting the challenges of the markets throughout the quarter. In spite
of the environment during the last six months, our commitment to growing
and strengthening our franchise is stronger than ever. We continue to
make strategic investments in our business both domestically and overseas. 
We have developed a strong international presence and intend to continue
our expansion in Asia, Latin America and Europe."

The company also said that with the recent announcement of two
significant transactions, merger and acquisition activity remains an area
of strength. Bear Stearns is serving as advisor to Martin Marietta in its
merger with Lockheed Corporation and as advisor to ITT/Cablevision in its
proposed acquisition of Madison Square Garden from Viacom Inc. Most
recently Bear Stearns served as global coordinator and lead manager for
the US and international tranches of the $480 million Usiminas
privatization, the largest Brazilian global equity offering to date.
