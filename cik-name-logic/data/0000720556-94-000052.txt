CALIFORNIA ENERGY ANNOUNCES THAT 
SDG&E DISMISSED THE SUIT AGAINST YUMA COGENERATION ASSOCIATES 

OMAHA, NEBRASKA, September 28, 1994 -- California Energy Company,
Inc. (NYSE, PSE and LSE: CE) announced today that San Diego Gas &
Electric Company ("SDG&E") had voluntarily dismissed with prejudice
its breach of contract case against Yuma Cogeneration Associates,
a subsidiary of California Energy which operates a 50 MW gas-fired
facility which sells power to SDG&E under a 30-year contract. The
suit was dismissed amicably, without payment by either party, after
California Energy provided certain technical information to SDG&E
which cleared up a technical misunderstanding SDG&E had regarding
the size of the facility.

California Energy Company is a leading international developer,
owner and operator of geothermal and other environmentally
responsible power generation facilities. Its six existing
facilities currently produce in excess of 325 MW with an additional
300 MW under construction.
