Item 5. Other Events.

On August 24, 1994, Registrant issued the following press release: 

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- Caesars World, Inc. (NYSE/CAW)
today announced net income for fiscal 1994 was $78,361,000,
or $3.19 per share, compared with $83,215,000, or $3.40 per
share, for fiscal 1993.

Revenue for the fiscal year ended July 3l, 1994,
surpassed the billion dollar mark for the first time in the
company's history, totaling $1,015,766,000, compared with
$983,459,000 in fiscal 1993.

Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer,
said, "We are pleased to report that casino activity in
both our Nevada and New Jersey operations achieved record
levels in fiscal 1994. The decline in earnings principally
reflects fiscal 1994 fourth quarter results which were down
from the prior-year quarter due to significantly lower
table-game win percentages in our Nevada operations." The
company had announced in June 1994 that it anticipated a
substantial reduction in profits as a result of unusually
large losses during the middle of the month to a small
number of long-term, table-game customers in Nevada.

Net income for the fiscal 1994 fourth quarter was
$16,905,000, or 69 cents per share, compared with
$25,686,000, or $1.04 per share, during the fiscal 1993
fourth quarter. Revenue totaled $251,458,000, compared
with $262,015,000 in the fiscal 1993 quarter.

For the full year, the company's Nevada table-game
activity and win increased over fiscal 1993 despite a
slightly lower table-game win percentage. The full-year
slots activity and win results established all-time highs
for the Nevada operations. However, operating income in
Nevada declined due to higher marketing and payroll costs,
and an increased provision for bad debts.

In New Jersey, increased contributions to income
during the fiscal 1994 fourth quarter and full-year
reporting periods resulted largely from casino operations
at Caesars Atlantic City. Record slots revenue was
realized in both reporting periods and there was a positive
impact from the Simulcast Casino which opened in October
1993 and included high-tech horse race betting, a poker
section and casino table games. Keno was introduced into
this expanded area during June 1994. For the full year,
the improved results in New Jersey were partially offset by
slightly lower table-game win and by higher operating
costs, notably the increased payroll for additional
employees in the expanded casino.

During the fiscal 1994 fourth quarter, the company
also realized a positive contribution to earnings from an
unconsolidated affiliate in Windsor, Canada. Caesars
World has a one-third interest in the joint venture which
operates an interim Windsor casino which opened in May
1994.

The company's other expenses decreased from the fiscal
1993 fourth quarter, primarily due to a reduction in legal
expenses, expense accruals and lower costs associated with
stock appreciation rights. These reduced expenses were
partially offset by higher costs related to the pursuit of
expansion opportunities in potential new gaming venues.

During both fiscal 1994 reporting periods, when
compared with the same fiscal 1993 periods, Caesars World's
net interest expenses decreased due to lower outstanding
debt and a debt refinancing which was substantially
completed during the fiscal 1993 first quarter.
