CPI CORP. ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

- Earnings per share of 11 cents vs. 14 cents.
- Sales increase 9.7% as new marketing programs boost portrait 
studio results.
- Photofinishing earnings reflect industry softness, plus 
investments in new marketing projects.
- Management anticipates meeting, and possibly exceeding, high 
end of full-year EPS range. 

ST. LOUIS, MO., September 1, 1994 -- CPI Corp. (NYSE - CPY) today
announced that while second quarter sales increased 9.7%
year-to-year, due primarily to strong results in the portrait
studio segment, net earnings and earnings per share declined
somewhat, primarily due to continuing softness in the
photofinishing business, expected seasonal losses in the Prints
Plus wall decor chain and higher interest expense. The company
anticipates further improvements in portrait studios for the second
half of fiscal 1994 as it continues to roll out new marketing
programs.

Sales for the 12 weeks ended July 23, 1994 increased to $104.7
million from $95.4 million in the 12 weeks ended July 24, 1993. 
Net earnings declined to $1.6 million from last year's $2.1
million, while earnings per share were 11 cents versus 14 cents,
with 2.3% fewer shares outstanding. The quarter's income from
operations was slightly above last year's before reflecting a $0.7
million increase in net interest expense due to the August 1993
private note placement.

For the 24 weeks ended July 23, 1994, sales increased 11.2% to
$204.8 million from $184.2 million due to growth in portrait studio
revenues and the inclusion of the full 24 weeks of the Prints Plus
business, which was acquired in May 1993. The company incurred a
loss of $0.9 million, or $0.06/share, in the period. Excluding the
cumulative effect of a first-quarter 1993 accounting change which
caused a one-time credit of $2.1 million, or $0.14/share, 1993's
first half showed a loss of $0.5 million, or $0.03/share. Last
year's net earnings after the accounting change were $1.6 million,
or $0.11/share. A 20.9% reduction in general corporate expense was
due primarily to the non-recurrence of last year's first-quarter
one-time charges for severance and early retirement allowances.

For the 52 weeks ended July 23, 1994, sales increased to $496.1
million from $448.3 million for the 53 weeks ended July 24, 1993. 
Net earnings were $10.7 million, or $0.74 per share, versus last
year's $18.4 million, or $1.25 per share (after inclusion of the
special item mentioned above).

During the second quarter, in accordance with its ongoing program,
the company repurchased 471,600 shares of its common stock,
bringing the cumulative repurchases for the year to 676,455.

Commenting on the company's progress, Alyn V. Essman, chairman and
chief executive officer, said, "The combined first and second
quarter results in the Sears Portrait Studios were quite a bit
better than we expected, and though their effect is partially
offset by weakness in the photofinishing segment, we anticipate
improvement in overall performance for the full year. Our current
analysis, barring unforeseen circumstances, would lead us to expect
earnings to exceed $1.00 per share, and if we see continuing
positive results in the portrait studios, to be comfortably ahead
of our previously projected $1.05 maximum."

Discussing Portrait Studio operations, Essman said, "Second quarter
sales were up 15.2% to $45.8 million, while operating earnings
increased 38.5% to $4.7 million, reflecting the impact of new
marketing programs and the partial installation of new technology. 
For the first half of the year, revenues and operating earnings
increased approximately 9% and 10%, respectively, despite expenses
incurred year-to-date of $2.0 million related to the new
technology. It is worth noting that only one-third of the first
half's business was conducted utilizing the new technology. We
anticipate completing the installation of the system in the U.S.
during the third quarter, with 100% coverage prior to the
all-important Christmas season. The remaining Canadian
installations (about 10% of total studios) should be completed in
early 1995. Full-year 1994 expenses for the new technology are
expected to total approximately $6.2 million."

Turning to the Photofinishing segment, Essman commented, "Although
sales increased slightly to $46.1 million, operating earnings
declined to $2.7 million from $4.2 million. Reflecting weak
industry trends, the company experienced reductions in roll volume
and gross margin; those declines were offset by lower operating
expenses, and excluding two major marketing tests, operating
earnings in comparable operations were essentially flat. The
year-to-year difference in segment earnings is primarily due to
significant investments in those tests in two major markets, which
in the first six months show comparable operating declines in
excess of $1.25 million. The tests are encouraging in their
initial stages but will probably continue to penalize earnings
throughout 1994. If successful, the projects could form the base
for new marketing programs in 1995."

Continuing, Essman said, "Second quarter sales in the Other
Products and Services segment increased to $12.7 million compared
to last year's $9.8 million, mainly due to the inclusion of
full-quarter revenues of the Prints Plus chain, which was acquired
May 30, 1993. Although the business recorded seasonal operating
losses, it is performing generally within plan and is expected to
make a positive contribution to CPI's results again in the current
year. We expect to open about twenty new Prints Plus units this
year, and have similar expansion plans for 1995. Electronic
publishing, the segment's other business, experienced a further
reduction in operating losses on essentially flat sales."

CPI Corp. is a consumer services company with $475.5 million in
fiscal 1993 sales, operating over 1,800 retail locations, including
1,005 Sears Portrait Studios in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada,
667 CPI/Fox Photo/Proex photofinishing locations, 107 Prints Plus
wall decor locations, and 45 high-tech copy stores.
