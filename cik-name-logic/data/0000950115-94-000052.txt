W. CONSHOHOCKEN, PA - EQK GREEN ACRES, L.P. (NYSE: EGA) 
ANNOUNCES CHANGE IN FORMAT AND CONVERSION TO A 
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TUESDAY, MARCH 1, 1994

At the close of business on February 28th, EQK Green Acres, L.P. (NYSE
symbol EGA) was converted from a limited partnership to a real estate 
investment trust, adopting the name EQK Green Acres Trust.

'More significant than the change from partnership to REIT, are the 
changes in the Company's format,' observed Myles H. Tanenbaum, the Company's 
President. 'We are now allowed to add to the Company's real estate portfolio 
and to continue operations indefinitely.' From inception, the Company was 
limited to ownership of Green Acres Mall, a 1.7 million square foot 
super-regional shopping mall complex located in Valley Stream, L.I., NY, 
which heretofore was to be sold by the end of the decade.

The Company has elected to largely self-manage its own affairs, 
terminating the existing advisory and property management contracts.

<PAGE>

Pursuant to the conversion, each outstanding Unit has been converted 
into one Common Share of Beneficial Interest in the REIT. As previously 
described in materials provided to Unitholders, additional Common Shares are 
being issued to the partnership's general partners and advisor in connection 
with the conversion. The Common Shares will trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange using the same symbol (EGA) that had been used for the Units.
