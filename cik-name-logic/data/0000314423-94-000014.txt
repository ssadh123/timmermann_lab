ROUNDY'S, INC. AND SPARTAN STORES, INC.
ANNOUNCE INTENT TO MERGE

September 30, 1994 (MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin) -- Two of the Midwest's largest food

wholesalers have announced their intent to merge. The Boards of Directors of

Roundy's, Inc., of Pewaukee, Wisconsin, and Spartan Stores, Inc., of Grand 

Rapids, Michigan, said a letter of intent to merge has been signed by both

companies.

Discussions between the companies have been underway for several months.

Following this week's action, Roundy's, Inc. and Spartan Stores, Inc. will

initiate necessary filings with regulatory agencies, follow a fiduciary 

procedure known as 'due diligence,' and execute a formal merger document as

soon as possible. Neither company will speculate on how long it will take

to complete the process.

The transaction will involve an exchange of stock, with no cash involved. Both

companies have announced that this is a true merger in which neither is

dominant.

Roundy's-Spartan Merger
Page 2

The new corporation, as yet unnamed, will be the nation's third largest food

wholesaler. (Roundy's, Inc. currently ranks sixth and Spartan Stores, Inc.

ranks seventh.)

Roundy's and Spartan are cooperative, privately-held corporations owned

primarily by the retailers they serve. The new corporation, whose charter

has not yet been drafted, will remain privately held according to officials

from both companies.

Roundy's, Inc. and Spartan Stores, Inc. are similar in many ways. Both

companies serve primarily independent retailers, they share similar

technologies and systems, operating philosophies and corporate cultures, and

are both located in the Midwest.

Company officials declined to speculate on which, if any, divisions or

operating centers of either company would be affected as a result of the

merger. They pointed out, however, that the differences between the two

companies presents a whole set of new opportunities for growth.

Roundy's, Inc. operates 10 divisions in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana

and Ohio. Its total 1993 revenue (year ended January 1, 1994) was $2.48

billion. Spartan Stores, Inc. operates nine distribution facilities in

Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. Its total 1994 revenue (year ended March 26,

1994) was $2.19 billion.

- - - - As of January 1, 1994, 15,500 shares of Class A Common Stock and 
1,140,302 shares of Class B Common Stock were outstanding. As the 
company is privately held, there is no market for such shares.

- - - - The company's core business is the wholesale distribution of food 
and nonfood products to supermarkets and warehouse food stores in 
Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, 
Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia. The company also owns 
and operates eight Pick 'N Save retail warehouse food stores. In 
addition, the company provides specialized support services for 
retail grocers including promotional merchandising and advertising 
programs, accounting and inventory control, store development, 
financing, and management assistance, and business insurance 
lines.

- - - - The company services 1,130 retail grocery stores and 682 
convenience stores.

- - - - Roundy's operates its food wholesale business as a cooperative -- 
its retail customers own shares in the corporation. Federal tax 
liabilities are determined under Subchapter T of the Internal 
Revenue Code. These stockholder-customers receive "patronage 
dividends" from Roundy's based on the sales of Roundy's to such 
stockholder-customers. The subsidiaries of Roundy's, on the other 
hand, do not operate as cooperatives. The customers serviced by 
these subsidiaries are independent grocers, and do not receive 
patronage dividends. In addition, approximately 31% of the 
outstanding Common Stock of Roundy's is held by employees or 
former customers of Roundy's. Although they participate in the 
accumulation of equity in the consolidated Company, they do not 
receive patronage dividends and do not own any Class A (voting) 
stock.
