Item 2. 

ACQUISITION OR DISPOSTION OF ASSETS 

The Merger (the Merger) of Libsab Bancorp, Inc. (Bancorp), the parent company
of Liberty Bank & Trust (Bank), Mayfield, Kentucky, into Peoples First
Acquisition Corporation II (Subsidiary), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Peoples
First Corporation (PFC), became effective upon the filing of Articles of Merger
with the Kentucky Secretary of State on October 7, 1994. In the Merger, the
surviving Subsidiary, acquired all the assets and assumed all the liabilities of
the Bancorp. At the time of the Merger, the principal asset of Bancorp was the
stock of the Bank. At June 30, 1994, Bancorp had, on a consolidated basis,
total assets of approximately $141.9 million, loans of approximately $74.1
million, deposits of approximately $119.1 million and net assets (stockholders'
equity) of approximately $12.9 million. 

PFC exchanged 1,077,853 shares of its common stock for all the outstanding
shares of Bancorp. PFC's common stock is traded on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) National Market System
(NMS) under the symbol PFKY. The last trading price reported by NASDAQ on
October 7, 1994, for PFKY was $21.75 per share. This business combination will
be accounted for as a pooling-of-interest. PFC will report the results of
operations for 1994 as though Bancorp had been combined as of the beginning of
1994 and financial statements for prior years will be restated on a combined
basis to furnish comparative information. 

Peoples First generally intends to continue to use the assets acquired in the
Merger for the purpose of the general business conducted by a commercial bank,
their use immediately before the Merger.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors
Libsab Bancorp, Inc.
Mayfield, Kentucky

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Libsab Bancorp,
Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Libsab Bancorp,
Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 the
corporation adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" and No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities".

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Libsab Bancorp, Inc. (the Corporation) and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Liberty Bank and Trust (the Bank). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Presentation of cash flows:

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
includes cash on hand, amounts due from banks (including cash
items in process of clearing) and federal funds sold. Cash flows
from loans originated by the Bank, deposits, and securities sold
under repurchase agreements are reported net.

Trust assets:

Assets of the trust department, other than trust cash on deposit
at the Bank, are not included in these financial statements
because they are not assets of the Bank.

Securities Available-for-Sale and Investment Securities:

The Bank adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities" (SFAS 115), as of the end of 1993. This statement
establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for
all investments in debt securities. The statement requires that
securities be classified into one of three categories; trading,
available-for-sale or investment.

Trading securities are bought and held principally with the
intention of selling them in the near term in an anticipation of
market gains. The Bank has no trading securities as of December
31, 1993 and 1992.

Securities classified as available-for-sale are those securities
that the Bank intends to hold for an indefinite period of time
but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security
classified as available-for-sale would be based on various
factors, including significant movements in interest rates,
changes in the maturity mix of the Bank's assets and liabilities,
liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations, and other
similar factors. Securities available-for-sale are stated at
fair value for the year ended December 31, 1993 and at the lower
of amortized cost or market for the year ended December 31, 1992.
Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 115, unrealized gains or
losses are reported as increases or decreases in stockholders'
equity, net of the related deferred tax effect. Realized gains
or losses, determined on the basis of the adjusted cost of
specific securities sold, are included in earnings. Mortgage-
backed securities represent a significant portion of the
securities available-for-sale portfolio. Amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts on mortgage-backed securities
are analyzed in relation to the corresponding prepayment rates,
both historical and estimated, using a method which approximates
the level-yield method.

(Continued)

<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Securities classified as investment are those securities the Bank
has both the intent and ability to hold to maturity regardless of
changes in market conditions, liquidity needs or changes in
general economic conditions. These securities are carried at
cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts, computed by the level-yield method over their
contractual lives. Gain or loss is recorded when realized on a
specific identification basis or when, in the opinion of
management, an unrealized loss is other than temporary in nature.

Loans and allowance for loan losses:

Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by
unearned discount and fees and an allowance for possible loan
losses.

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered
adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably
anticipated. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to
operating expense and reduced by net charge-offs. The Bank makes
continuous credit reviews of the loan portfolio and considers
current economic conditions, historical loss experience, review
of specific problem loans and other factors in determining the
adequacy of the allowance balance.

Unearned interest on discounted loans is amortized to income over
the life of the loans, using a method that approximates the
interest method. For all other loans, interest is accrued daily
on the outstanding balances. Accrual of interest is discontinued
on a loan when management believes, after considering collection
efforts and other factors, that the borrower's financial
condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful.

Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan
origination costs are being deferred and the net amount amortized
as an adjustment of the related loan's yield. The Bank is
generally amortizing these amounts over the contractual life of
the loans.

During May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (SFAS 114), which is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994.
SFAS 114 requires that impaired loans be measured at the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, or at the loan's observable market price
or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent. The Bank is currently evaluating when and how it will
adopt SFAS 114, as well as the possible financial impact to the
Bank.

Bank premises and equipment:

Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income taxes:

The Corporation and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal
income tax return. The provision for income taxes relates to all
items of revenue and expenses recognized for financial accounting
purposes during each of the years. The actual current tax
liability may be more or less than the charge against earnings
due to the effect of temporary differences between financial and
tax accounting resulting in deferred income taxes, and due to the
effect of certain items of revenue that are not taxable.

Effective January 1, 1993 the Bank adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS
109), which requires an asset and liability approach to financial
accounting and reporting for income taxes. The difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities is determined annually. Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are computed for those differences that have
future tax consequences using the currently enacted laws and
rates that apply to periods in which they are expected to affect
taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, if
necessary, to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that
will more likely than not be realized. Income tax expense is the
current tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus
the net change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.

The deferred method of accounting for income taxes under APB
Opinion 11, which applied in 1992, 1991 and prior years, requires
the recognition of deferred income taxes for income and expense
items that are reported in different years for financial
reporting purposes and for income tax purposes using the tax rate
applicable for the year of the calculation. Under this method,
deferred taxes are not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax
rates.

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities
are principally related to provisions for loan losses,
depreciation, capitalized interest, deferred compensation and
accrued pension cost.

Earnings per share:

Earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares outstanding (85,339 in 1993, 85,340 in
1992 and 83,580 in 1991).

Reclassification:

Certain items in the 1992 and 1991 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the classifications adopted for
1993.

Note 2. Cash and Due From Banks

Included in cash and due from banks are certain non-interest bearing
deposits that are held at the Federal Reserve or maintained in vault
cash in accordance with average balance requirements specified by the
Federal Reserve Board. The average balance requirements as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $860,000 and $750,000 respectively.

Note 7. Employee Benefit Plans

The Bank has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all full-time employees. The plan provides pension
benefits based on the employee's compensation and length of service
not to exceed thirty years. The Bank's funding policy is to
contribute annually at least the minimum amount required by government
funding standards but not more than is tax deductible. The Bank
contributed $85,292 for 1993, $-0- for 1992 and 1991. Plan assets
consist primarily of unallocated insurance contracts.

Net periodic pension expense for the plan consisted of the following

recognition in the balance sheet of an additional minimum liability
for pension plans with accumulated benefits in excess of plan assets
and unfunded accrued pension cost. At December 31, 1992 an additional
liability of $30,538 is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
This amount represents a net loss not yet recognized as net periodic
pension expense and is reported as a reduction to equity, net of any
deferred tax benefit.

Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank consists of various loans due in
monthly installments, including interest at rates ranging from 5.55%

stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, 100% of its home mortgage
portfolio as collateral for such borrowings.

Aggregate maturities of the advances at December 31, 1993 are as
follows:

</TABLE>

The Bank, to maintain its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank
(FHLB), is required to hold FHLB capital stock. A minimum balance of
stock is required, equivalent to the greater of .3% of the Bank's
total assets or 1.0% of the outstanding balance of the Bank's
residential mortgage loans. The stock is not publicly traded and is
purchased and redeemed at par of $100 per share from the Federal Home
Loan Bank.

Note 11. Regulatory Matters

Banking laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be
paid without prior approval of the Bank's regulatory agency. Under
the limitation, the Bank could have paid dividends to the extent of
the current year earnings plus $1,738,025 of retained net earnings
from the preceding two years.

Banking regulations also require the Bank to maintain certain minimum
capital levels in relation to Bank assets. At December 31, 1993,
regulations required a ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0
percent. The Bank's capital, as defined by the regulations, was
approximately 12.0 percent of risk-weighted assets. In addition,
banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 3.0
percent. At December 31, 1993, the Bank's leverage ratio was
approximately 9.5 percent.

Note 12. Transactions with Related Parties

The Bank has had, and may be expected to have in the future, banking
transactions in the ordinary course of business with directors,
principal officers, their immediate families and affiliated companies
in which they are principal stockholders (commonly referred to as
related parties), all of which have been, in the opinion of
management, on the same terms, including interest rates and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with others. Loans to related parties aggregated
$1,531,708 and $516,149 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies

Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk:

The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs
of its customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.
These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit
risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets.

The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the
contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same
credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations
as they do for on-balance-sheet instruments. A summary of the
Bank's commitments at December 31, 1993 and 1992 is as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

1993 1992
------------ ------------
<S> <C> <C>
Commitments to extend credit $ 4,352,410 $ 4,227,623
Standby letters of credit 375,400 235,250
------------ ------------

$ 4,727,810 $ 4,462,873
------------ ------------

</TABLE>

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of
collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon
extension of credit, is based on managements' credit evaluation
of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts
receivable, crops, livestock, inventory, property and
equipment, residential real estate and income producing
commercial properties.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by
the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public
and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that
involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral
held varies as specified above and is required in instances
which the Bank deems necessary.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Concentrations of credit risk:

All of the Bank's loans, commitments to extend credit, and standby
letters of credit have been granted to customers in the Bank's market
area. Investments in securities issued by state and political
subdivisions (see Note 3) also involve governmental entities within
the Bank's market area. The concentrations of credit by type of loan
are set forth in Note 4. The distribution of commitments to extend
credit approximates the distribution of loans outstanding. Standby
letters of credit were granted primarily to commercial borrowers. The
Bank, as a matter of policy, does not extend credit to any single
borrower or group of related borrowers in excess of $1,200,000.
Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial
portion of its debtors' ability to honor their contracts is dependent
upon the local economic sector.

Other commitments:

The Bank leases certain equipment under noncancelable term leases
expiring through October 1994. Operating expenses include equipment
rentals of $18,362 in 1993, $16,494 in 1992 and $11,932 in 1991.

The Bank also rents out office space under a one year renewable
operating lease. Rental income aggregated $14,000 in 1993, 1992 and
1991.

Contingencies:

In the normal course of business, the Bank is involved in various
legal proceedings, including but not necessarily limited to those
associated with loan defaults and foreclosures. In the opinion of
management, any liability resulting from such proceedings would not
have a material effect on the Bank's financial statements.

Note 15. Revisions to Previously Issued Financial Statements

Subsequent to original issuance of the Corporation's 1993 financial
statements, management became aware of errors in the Bank's financial
statements for 1993 and earlier periods.

A summary of the revisions and the increase (decrease) to net income,
net of income taxes, is as follows:

</TABLE>

(A) Primarily based on quantitative considerations, the Bank had not
adopted in previously issued financial statements the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions" (SFAS 87). Qualitative considerations
relating to the affiliation agreement discussed in Note 16 insist, for
due diligence purposes, that the statement be adopted. The statement
has been adopted as of its effective date, which was prior to January
1, 1991. Accordingly, retained earnings as of January 1, 1991 have
been decreased $49,118 for the cumulative effect of the adjustment,
previously unrecorded accrued pension cost of $74,421, net of $25,303
reduction in deferred income tax liability. Net income for 1993 has
been reduced by $5,927 of previously understated pension cost, net of
$2,015 reduction in deferred income taxes. Net income for 1992 has
been reduced by $65,505 of previously understated pension cost, net of
$22,272 reduction in deferred income taxes. Net income for 1991 has
been reduced by $48,431 of previously understated pension cost, net of
$16,466 reduction in deferred income taxes.

(B) Facts existing at the time the 1993 financial statements were
originally issued were misused or overlooked. Also, mistakes were
made in the application of accounting principles. This involved Bank
management's overall credit reviews, specific problem loans, and other
factors considered in determining the loan loss provision charged to
1993 operating expense. The 1993 financial statements have been
corrected to increase the provision by $146,500, net of reduction in
deferred income tax expense of $49,810.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(C) Errors were made in analysis of significant factors, such as
prepayments and interest rates, that affect investment yield or
recoverability of the carrying value of mortgage-backed securities.
As a result unamortized premium, net of unaccreted discount, was
overstated in the previously issued December 31, 1993 consolidated
balance sheet. Net income for 1993 has been reduced by $121,311 of
previously overstated taxable interest income on securities, net of
$41,307 reduction in income taxes.

(D) As discussed in Note 1, the Bank has adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115), as of
December 31, 1993. Previously issued financial statements stated the
Bank had chosen to delay implementation of the statement until January
1, 1994. To facilitate the impending merger as explained in Note 16,
the Bank chose to adopt the accounting change in these revised 1993
financial statements. The early adoption had no effect on 1993
income, as revised. Unrealized appreciation of $944,792 on securities
available-for-sale resulted in a $623,563 increase, net of $321,229 of
deferred income taxes, to stockholders' equity at December 31, 1993.

Where applicable, these matters have been considered in various other
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (notes). In addition to
the matters described above, other changes have been made in the notes
to these revised financial statements to clarify accounting policies
or other matters. These changes had no affect on net income, earnings
per share, or total assets of the Corporation.

Note 16. Event (Unaudited) Subsequent to the Date of the Report of Independent
Auditors

The Corporation entered into an affiliation agreement with Peoples
First Corporation (Peoples) on February 24, 1994, subsequently amended
April 15, 1994. Peoples, headquartered in Paducah, Kentucky, with
total assets of approximately $1 billion serves primarily western
Kentucky and the contiguous interstate area. The affiliation
agreement, as amended, calls for the Corporation to be merged into PFC
Acquisition Corporation II, a Kentucky Corporation and subsidiary of
Peoples. Effective upon the merger, shareholders of the corporation
will receive 12.632 shares of Peoples common stock for each share of
Libsab Bancorp, Inc. common stock, or a total of 1,078,000 shares.
The merger is contingent upon approval of various regulatory agencies
and the stockholders of the Corporation and, if approved, is expected
to close in the third quarter of 1994.

July 28, 1994 current report on Form 8-K filed by Peoples First with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on August 1, 1994.

(1) Peoples First's historical net income per share has not been restated to
reflect the pooling-of-interest merger with First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. that
was consummated on March 10, 1994. First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. converted from
the mutual form of organization to a stock corporation during 1991, and
accordingly, the average number of shares outstanding are not meaningful to the
restated consolidated operations of Peoples First.
