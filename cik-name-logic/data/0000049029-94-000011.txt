Item 4. Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

On May 24, 1994, the Board of Directors of Hughes Supply,
Inc.(the "Registrant") appointed Price Waterhouse as audi-
tors for the three fiscal year period commencing with the
Registrant's current fiscal year ending January 27, 1995. 
The term of engagement of the Registrant's previous audi-
tors, the firm of Coopers & Lybrand, expired at the conclu-
sion of the fiscal year ended January 28, 1994. Price
Waterhouse was selected by the Board upon the recommendation
of the Audit Committee following consideration of proposals
submitted at the Committee's request by a number of indepen-
dent accounting firms including, among others, Coopers &
Lybrand and Price Waterhouse.

(a) Previous independent accountants.

(i) The former accountants, Coopers & Lybrand,
were not reappointed by the Registrant fol-
lowing the expiration of their term of engag-
ement.

(ii) The reports of Coopers & Lybrand on the fi-
nancial statements for the past two fiscal
years contained no adverse opinion or dis-
claimer of opinion and were not qualified or
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principle, except for the change
in accounting for income taxes in fiscal year
ended January 31, 1992 referred to in the
reports of Coopers & Lybrand.

(iii) The Registrant's Board of Directors approved
the change of independent accountants upon
the recommendation of the Audit Committee.

(iv) In connection with its audits for the two
most recent fiscal years and through May 24,
1994, there have been no disagreements with
Coopers & Lybrand on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,
which disagreements if not resolved to the
satisfaction of Coopers & Lybrand would have
caused them to make reference thereto in
their report on the financial statements for
such years.

(v) During the two most recent fiscal years and
through May 24, 1994, there have been no
reportable events as defined in
Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v).

(vi) The Registrant has requested that Coopers &
Lybrand furnish it with a letter addressed to
the Securities and Exchange Commission stat-
ing whether or not it agrees with the above
statements. A copy of such letter, dated May
31, 1994, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this
Form 8-K.

(b) New independent accountants.

(i) The Registrant engaged Price Waterhouse as
its new independent accountants as of May 24,
1994. During the two most recent fiscal
years and through May 24, 1994, the Regis-
trant has not consulted with Price Waterhouse
on items which (1) were or should have been
subject to SAS 50 or (2) concerned the sub-
ject matter of a disagreement or reportable
event with the former auditor (as described
in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(2)).
