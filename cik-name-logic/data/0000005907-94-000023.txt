Re: AT&T Corp.
Medium Term Notes, Series A (the "Notes")

Gentlemen:

I have acted as tax counsel for AT&T Corp. (the "Company") in
connection with the proposed issuance of the Notes. You have requested my
opinion regarding the accuracy of the disclosure of the United States
federal income tax considerations pertaining to the Notes as set forth in
the Prospectus Supplement dated October 8, 1993 (the "Prospectus
Supplement") as modified by the Pricing Supplement No. 2 dated May 26, 1994
relating to the Notes (the "Pricing Supplement"). The Pricing Supplement
and the Prospectus Supplement supplement the Prospectus dated June 23, 1993
relating to the issuance of notes and warrants to purchase notes of the
Company (the "Prospectus"). The Pricing Supplement, the Prospectus
Supplement and the Prospectus relate to the Company's Registration
Statement No. 33-49589 on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, which
became effective June 23, 1993 (the "Registration Statement").

<PAGE> 2

My opinion is based upon:

(i) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury
Regulations issued thereunder, Revenue Rulings and other announcements
issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and judicial decisions in effect as
of the date hereof (such statute, regulations, rulings, announcements, and
decisions collectively referred to herein as the "Code and Regulations
issued thereunder"), all of which are subject to change with prospective or
retroactive effect, which change could adversely affect or render
inapplicable my opinion; and

(ii) my assumption that the terms of the Notes are as described in
the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Supplement.

I have not myself checked or verified the accuracy or completeness of
the information contained in the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and
the Pricing Supplement other than the statements set forth under the
heading "Taxation" in the Prospectus Supplement as modified by the
statements under the heading "Taxation" in the Pricing Supplement.

Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the statements in
the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Taxation" as modified by the
statements in the Pricing Supplement under the heading "Taxation" are
accurate summaries of the Code and Regulations issued thereunder.

I consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's
Form 8-K, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and which is incorporated in the Registration Statement.

Very truly yours,

Ephraim M. Brecher
Vice President - Taxes and
Tax Counsel
