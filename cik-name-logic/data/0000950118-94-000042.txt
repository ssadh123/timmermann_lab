Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
Crestar Financial Corporation And Subsidiaries

(1) Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Crestar Financial Corporation and
Subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to general
practice within the banking industry. Certain reclassifications have been made
to the prior years' consolidated financial statements to conform to the 1993
presentation.

The following is a summary of the more significant policies:

(a) Principles Of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Crestar Financial Corporation and
Subsidiaries (Crestar) include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. In the condensed financial statements of Crestar Financial
Corporation (Parent), the investments in subsidiaries are stated at equity in
the net assets of such subsidiaries (note 21).

Business combinations accounted for as purchases are included from their
respective dates of acquisition. The excess of cost over the estimated fair
value of the tangible assets and liabilities acquired is amortized over the
periods estimated to be benefited.

Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not assets of Crestar and are
not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

(b) Investment Securities

Securities which the Corporation has both the ability and intent to hold to
maturity or on a long-term basis are classified as investment securities
(determined at purchase), and except for marketable equity securities, are
carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
using the level yield method over the period to maturity, or earlier call date
if appropriate, of the related securities. Marketable equity securities are
carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value, and unrealized losses
are reflected as a reduction of shareholders' equity. Realized gains or losses
on investment securities are recognized at the time of sale using the specific
identification method and are classified as securities gains or losses in the
accompanying statements of income.

(c) Money Market Investments

Money market investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value,
except for trading account securities, which are carried at market value.
Securities held for trading purposes are classified as trading account
securities. Adjustments to market and trading account gains and losses are
classified as other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income. Trading account interest and dividend income is included in income on
money market investments.

(d) Securities Held For Sale

Securities held for sale represent securities to be held for indefinite periods
of time but not necessarily until maturity (determined at purchase date).
Securities held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market
value. Adjustments to market value and realized gains or losses are classified
as securities gains or losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.

(e) Mortgage Loans Held For Sale

Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value. Adjustments to market and realized gains and losses are classified
as other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

(f) Loans

Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding net of unearned income.

Interest on some instalment loans and some second mortgage loans is accrued
using the sum-of-the-months-digits method (78ths method), which does not produce
results materially different from the level yield method. Interest on other
loans is accrued by multiplying the applicable rates by the principal amounts
outstanding. Most equipment leases, included in the commercial loan category,
are accounted for using the direct financing method for financial reporting
purposes.

Interest is recognized on the cash basis for all loans carried in nonaccrual
status. Loans generally are placed in nonaccrual status when the collection of
principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier if collection is
uncertain based upon an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral
and the financial strength of the borrower. Instalment loans are placed in
nonaccrual status when past due 120 days and are charged off when past due 180
days. Generally, bank card loans are not placed in nonaccrual status, but are
charged off at the earlier of when past due 180 days or notification of
bankruptcy.

Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs
are deferred and the net amount is amortized as an adjustment of the related
loan's yield. Crestar amortizes these amounts over the contractual life of the
related loans or over the commitment period.

(g) Allowance For Loan Losses

The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based upon
a review and analysis of the loan portfolio. The allowance reflects an amount
that, in management's judgment, is adequate to provide for losses inherent in
the portfolio. Management's review includes monthly analyses of past due,
problem and nonaccrual loans and a detailed periodic classification report.

Estimates of future losses involve the exercise of judgment and the use of
assumptions. The principal factors considered in determining the adequacy of the
allowance are the composition of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience,
anticipated losses, economic conditions, the value and adequacy of collateral,
and the current level of the allowance.

Accrued interest receivable is generally charged against the allowance for loan
losses when deemed uncollectible.

(h) Premises And Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges are computed under the
straight-line method. Premises and equipment are depreciated over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, except for leasehold improvements which are
amortized over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives
of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Certain noncancelable leases have
been capitalized and are classified as premises and equipment in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Related amounts representing capital
lease obligations are classified as long-term debt in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the interest method to
allocate payments between principal and interest. The initial carrying amounts
represent the present value of the future rental payments, discounted at the
incremental borrowing rate of the lessee. Most of these capital lease assets are

amortized over the lease term.

Estimated lives of the principal items of premises and equipment are: buildings
and improvements-3-to 50 years; and furniture, fixtures and equipment-3 to 12
years. The costs of major renovations are capitalized, while the costs of
ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

(i) Intangible Assets

Deposit base intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 4 to 15
years, primarily on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-
line basis over 15 years. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion
to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income to be derived from
the servicing activities. The period of amortization ranges from 7 to 20 years,
depending on the expected life of the mortgages being serviced. Other intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10 to 20
years.

(j) Foreclosed Properties

Property acquired through legal foreclosure proceedings, abandonment of the
property, acceptance of deed in lieu of foreclosure or transfer in exchange for
an outstanding loan is classified as foreclosed properties, and carried at
estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure,
any excess of cost over the estimated fair value is charged to the allowance for
loan losses, and estimated selling costs are expensed as foreclosed properties
expense. After foreclosure, the estimated fair value is reviewed periodically by
management. Write-downs are charged against current earnings or any applicable
foreclosed property valuation allowance.

(k) Income Taxes

During 1993, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for income taxes
(see financial statement note 13) and, accordingly, records a provision for
income taxes based on the amounts of current and deferred taxes payable (or
refundable) for the year. The deferred tax expense or benefit represents the
change in the net deferred tax asset or liability during the period. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing
carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement
reporting purposes that will reverse in future periods.

In 1992 and prior years, a provision for deferred income taxes was made for
revenue and expenses in the consolidated financial statements that were reported
in different periods for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.

The Parent and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return.
The provision for income taxes for each company is recorded on the basis of
filing separate income tax returns, after adjustments relating to consolidated
income tax regulations and signed tax sharing agreements. Income taxes currently
payable or receivable by each subsidiary are paid to or received from the
Parent.

(l) Earnings Per Share
Primary earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, less the
dividend requirements on preferred stock, by the weighted average number of

common shares outstanding during the year, including average common equivalent
shares attributable to dilutive stock options.

Fully diluted earnings per share are computed using average common shares,
including the maximum dilutive effect of average common equivalent shares,
increased by the number of shares that would result from assuming that all of
the 5% convertible subordinated debentures were converted into common stock on
January 1 of the applicable year and using net income increased by interest and
amortization of debt issuance expense, net of tax effect, relating to those
debentures and reduced by the dividends applicable to the Series B preferred
stock.

(m) Interest Rate Swaps And Other Agreements
Crestar enters into interest rate swaps and other agreements (caps, collars and
floors) to manage its interest rate exposure and to serve as a financial
intermediary for matched transactions. Transactions designated as hedges of
assets or liabilities are recorded using the accrual method and settlements are
classified as interest income or expense in the consolidated statements of
income according to the type of earning asset or interest bearing liability that
the agreement hedges. Fee income from matched arrangements for which Crestar
serves as a financial intermediary is recognized over the lives of the related
agreements and is classified as other income in the consolidated statements of
income.

(n) Pension Plans
Substantially all employees are covered by a pension plan. The net periodic
pension expense includes a service cost component, reflecting the actual return
on plan assets, and the effect of deferring and amortizing certain actuarial
gains and losses and the unrecognized net transition asset over 15 years.

(2) Mergers And Acquisitions
On May 14, 1993, Crestar purchased CFS Financial Corporation (CFS), a 19-branch
Fairfax, Virginia institution, through the payment of $6.5 million in cash and
the issuance of 1.4 million shares of Crestar common stock for all of the 3.0
million shares of CFS common stock outstanding. The acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase and, accordingly, the results of operations of CFS are
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since May 14,
1993. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the
tangible net assets acquired is classified as an intangible asset in the
consolidated balance sheet, and consists of goodwill and deposit base
intangibles. Goodwill of approximately $9.4 million is being amortized over 15
years. Deposit base intangibles of approximately $17.7 million are being
amortized over the estimated lives of the related deposit relationships, ranging
from 4 to 8 years. CFS had total assets of approximately $832 million as of May
14, 1993. The results of operations of CFS for the year ended December 31, 1992
and for the period from January 1, 1993 through May 13, 1993 were not material
to the results of operations of Crestar.
On June 25, 1993, Crestar acquired from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, deposits and selected assets of City National Bank of Washington, a
one-branch institution closed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Total deposits of approximately $21 million were acquired, and the related
deposit base intangible asset of $613 thousand is being amortized over the
estimated life of the deposit relationships.
Five acquisitions were announced in the fourth quarter of 1993 and are
summarized below.

<TABLE>

NVR Federal Savings Bank McLean, VA 4 488 387
Annapolis Bancorp, Inc. Annapolis, MD 10 329 292
Mortgage Capital Corporation St. Paul, MN - 13 -
</TABLE>

Two of the above acquisitions were consummated in January 1994. On January 11,
Crestar acquired Mortgage Capital Corporation, a wholesale mortgage loan
production company, with an initial purchase payment of $5.2 million. Under
terms of the purchase agreement, an additional $2.4 million may be paid to the
former owners, depending on the future performance of Mortgage Capital's
operations over the next five years. On January 28, 1994, Crestar completed the
acquisition of Virginia Federal Savings Bank for $52 million in a transaction
also accounted for as a purchase. Crestar's financial statements for 1993 do not
include these two acquisitions.

The acquisitions of Providence Savings and Loan Association, NVR Federal Savings
Bank and Annapolis Bancorp, Inc. are subject to regulatory approvals and are
expected to be completed in the first six months of 1994. Each transaction will
be recorded under the purchase method of accounting. Crestar will pay Annapolis
shareholders, in a combination of Crestar stock and cash, a total of $12.75 per
Annapolis share in a transaction valued at approximately $15 million. Approval
of the acquisition is required from Annapolis shareholders. Providence Savings
and Loan Association and NVR Federal Savings Bank will be acquired for cash in
transactions valued at $27 million and $48 million, respectively. Crestar
expects each of the five acquisitions to have a positive contribution to
earnings in the first twelve months following completion.

</TABLE>

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115), will be adopted
prospectively by Crestar on January 1, 1994. In future reporting periods,
securities classified as available for sale will be reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains or losses (net of tax effect) excluded from earnings and
reported as a component of shareholders' equity. Upon implementation of SFAS 115
in the first quarter of 1994, Crestar expects to classify a total of
approximately $2.9 billion of securities with an unrealized gain of $46 million
(as of January 1, 1994) as securities available for sale. The total unrealized
gain on securities available for sale, net of deferred taxes, will be recorded
as an increase to shareholders' equity upon adoption of SFAS 115. The unrealized
net gain (or loss) on securities available for sale recorded as a component of
shareholders' equity will be subject to change in future periods due to

fluctuations in market values, acquisition activities, and sales, purchases,
maturities and calls of securities classified as available for sale.

(6) Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties.
Nonperforming loans consist of loans on which income is recognized on the cash
basis (nonaccrual loans) and loans which meet the accounting definition of a
troubled debt restructuring (restructured loans). Nonperforming loans are
classified as loans in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There were
no material commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were
classified as nonperforming at December 31, 1993. At December 31, 1993 and 1992,
credits accounted for as troubled debt restructurings that were included in
nonaccrual loans totaled $21.9 million and $35.6 million, respectively.

In addition to the loans classified as nonaccrual at December 31, 1993 and
1992, there were $23.4 million and $26.0 million, respectively, that were past
due 90 days or more, the majority of which were collateralized or in the process
of collection. Instalment and bank card past due loans are subject to
established charge-off procedures as discussed in note 1(f).

Non-cash additions to foreclosed properties were $17.2 million, $114.1 million
and $92.6 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The amounts of
nonperforming assets at December 31 are as follows:

The Parent's 5% subordinated debentures are convertible, at the option of their
holders, into the Parent's common stock on or before May 1, 1994, at a
conversion price of $9.25 per share. From date of issuance to December 31, 1993,
$29,866,000 of the principal amount had been converted into 3,228,364 shares of
common stock. These debentures plus any accrued interest are redeemable, at the
Parent's option, in whole or in part, at 100 percent.

The 73/4% debentures due 1997 were redeemed at par value in September 1993.

The 81/4% subordinated notes, issued in July 1992, are not redeemable prior to
maturity. The 81/4% notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for federal bank regulatory
purposes.

The 85/8% subordinated notes may not be exchanged or redeemed prior to maturity,
except upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the federal income tax
treatment of the notes to the Corporation. The 85/8% notes qualify as Tier 2
capital for federal bank regulatory purposes.

Outstanding debt agreements at December 31, 1993 place restrictions upon the
disposal of subsidiaries' common stock, the payment of dividends and the
acquisition by the Parent or its subsidiaries of the Parent's capital stock.
Under these restrictions, all retained earnings were available for dividends as
of December 31, 1993.

Expenses relating to the issuance of the 81/4% and 85/8% notes and the 5%
debentures are being amortized to maturity on a straight-line basis. Upon
conversion to common stock, the unamortized expense attributable to the 5%
debentures is charged to capital surplus.

Mortgage indebtedness consists of the debt relating to four pledged facilities
owned by Crestar Bank which have an aggregate carrying value of $33,979,000 at
December 31, 1993. Payments in 1993, including interest, were $2,157,000.
Mortgage payments in 1994 are expected to approximate the 1993 amount.

The Corporation made payments of $17,928,000, $13,534,000 and $16,134,000 in
interest on long-term debt in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

On September 24, 1993, Crestar filed a shelf registration with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Under this registration statement, the Company may
issue up to $300,000,000 in unsecured subordinated debt securities, preferred
stock or common stock, or any combination thereof. Securities may be issued

separately or as units, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of
sale.

The combined maturities of all long-term debt for the years 1994 through 1998
are as follows:

(13) Income Taxes
Effective January 1, 1993, Crestar adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). There was no
material effect on the results of operations from the adoption of this
accounting method.

The current and deferred components of income tax expense allocated to
operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are as follows:

In thousands
Current: 1993 1992 1991
Federal $54,060 $ 37,996 $ 20,491

Total deferred tax expense (benefit) 9,291 (19,654) (16,482)
Total income tax expense $62,989 $ 19,689 $ 6,060

In addition to the state and local income tax expenses above, which pertain to
the non-bank affiliates and to the non-Virginia banks, Crestar Bank incurred
Virginia bank franchise taxes of $2,810,000 in 1993, $2,845,000 in 1992 and
$3,330,000 in 1991. This tax is imposed upon banks in Virginia in lieu of income
and personal property taxes. Crestar Bank remits 80 percent of the tax to the
Virginia municipalities in which it does business and the remaining 20 percent
to the State of Virginia.

The differences between the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal
income tax rate to income before income taxes and the actual income tax expense
allocated to operations are as follows:

The Corporation made income tax payments of $52,234,000, $37,371,000 and
$20,853,000 during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. At December 31, 1993, the
net deferred tax asset of $48,717,000 consisted of the following:

Deferred Deferred
Tax Tax
In thousands Assets Liabilities
Allowance for loan losses $71,113 $ -

Loan acquisition discount - 2,636
Other 5,240 3,740
Total deferred taxes $93,742 $45,025
Net deferred tax asset $48,717

The net deferred tax asset at January 1, 1993, included a valuation allowance of
$1.1 million (zero at December 31, 1993) representing a capital loss
carryforward expiring in 1998. This allowance was reduced to zero as a result of
a decrease in the corresponding temporary difference during 1993. Crestar has
sufficient taxable income in the available carryback periods and future taxable
income from reversing taxable temporary differences to realize substantially all
of its deferred tax assets. Management believes, based on the Corporation's
history of generating significant earnings and expectations of future earnings,
that it is more likely than not that all recorded deferred tax assets will be
realized.

The primary timing differences and the resulting deferred income tax benefits
for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991 are as follows:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

Net deferred income taxes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are
included in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate.

The tax returns through 1987 have either been examined or are no longer subject
to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). During 1993, the IRS
continued an examination of the tax returns for 1988 through 1990. Management
believes that any deficiency that may be determined will not have a material
effect on consolidated earnings.

(14) Shareholders' Equity And Earnings Per Share
During 1993 the Corporation purchased and retired 522,300 shares of common stock
at an average cost of $40.31 per share. There were no shares of common stock
purchased and retired in 1992 or 1991.

During 1993, $2,000 of subordinated debentures were converted to 216 shares of
common stock. During 1992 and 1991, $17,000 and $15,000, respectively, of
subordinated debentures were converted to 1,837 and 1,621 shares of common
stock, respectively.

In October 1992, Crestar completed the public offering and sale of 3,450,000
shares of common stock at $29.25 per share, providing a net addition of $97.1
million to shareholders' equity.

At December 31, 1993, common stock was reserved for issuance to directors,
officers or employees with respect to stock options granted from 1987 through
1993 as explained in note 18. There were 500,000 shares reserved for the
Performance Equity Plan, which provides awards to key executives based upon
attainment of specific long-term corporate goals. No shares were beneficially
owned by a subsidiary. There were 14,876 shares of common stock reserved for the
conversion of the 5% convertible subordinated debentures at December 31, 1993.

In December 1993, all 900,000 shares of the Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock Series B were redeemed at 103% of the stock's stated value, or a price per
share of $51.50, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

Average common and common equivalent shares used in the determination of
earnings per share were:

(16) Regulatory Requirements And Restrictions
Crestar Bank, Crestar Bank N.A. and Crestar Bank MD (Banks) are subject to
certain requirements imposed by state and federal banking statutes and
regulations. These requirements, among other things, establish minimum levels
for capital and restrict the amount of dividends that may be distributed and the
amount of loans that may be made by the Banks to the Parent and require that the
Banks maintain a minimum reserve balance with the Federal Reserve Bank.

Under the current supervisory practices of the Banks' regulatory agencies, prior
approval from those agencies is required if cash dividends declared in any given
year exceed net income for that year plus retained earnings of the two preceding
years. The amount of dividends available to the Parent from the Banks at January
1, 1994, without prior approval, was approximately $106.0 million. Cash
dividends paid by the Banks to the Parent in 1993, 1992 and 1991 were $93.8
million, $30.1 million and $28.1 million, respectively.

Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act places limitations on the amount of

credit that may be extended to the Parent by the Banks. Generally, up to 10% of
the Banks' regulatory capital, surplus, undivided profits, allowance for loan
losses and contingency reserves may be loaned by the Banks to the Parent. As of
December 31, 1993, $116.3 million of credit was available to the Parent under
this limitation, although no extensions of credit were outstanding.

For the reserve maintenance period in effect at December 31, 1993 and 1992, the
Banks were required to maintain average daily balances totaling approximately
$339.6 million and $291.6 million, respectively, with the Federal Reserve Bank.
The average amount of reserve balances for the year ended December 31, 1993
totaled approximately $294.2 million.

As of January 1, 1993, aggregate loans to directors and executive officers and
their associates were $13,874,000. Additions and repayments totaled $946,000 and
$3,966,000 respectively, during 1993 and the balance was $10,854,000 at year
end. These loans were made in the ordinary course of business and were arms-
length in terms of credit risk, interest rates and collateral requirements
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions. These loans do not represent
more than a normal credit risk. None of these loans were nonaccrual, past due or
restructured at December 31, 1993.

(17) Pension Plans
As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation had various non-contributory defined
benefit pension plans. Benefits under the plans are based on length of service
and a percentage of qualifying compensation during the final years of
employment. The Corporation's funding policy is to contribute annually the
maximum amount that can be contributed for federal income tax purposes.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During 1991 Crestar purchased annuities to settle certain pension obligations
for selected retirees of the Corporation. As a result, the projected benefit
obligation was reduced by $10,255,000 and a pre-tax gain of $2,236,000 was
recognized.
Net periodic pension expense in 1993, 1992 and 1991 includes the following
components:

<TABLE>
In thousands 1993 1992 1991
<S> <C> <C> <C>

Net periodic pension expense $ 1,994 $ 2,466 $ 3,726
</TABLE>

The following table sets forth the Plans' funded status and amounts recognized
in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
based on a measurement date of September 30 for each respective year:

In thousands 1993 1992
Accumulated benefit obligation, including vested

benefits of $81,540 in 1993 and $55,667 in 1992 $ (82,621) $(56,943)

Unrecognized net asset at October 1, 1985, being
recognized over 15 years (2,614) (3,031)
Prepaid (accrued) pension expense $ (874) $ 972

The weighted average discount rate and the rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation were 7.25% and 5.0%, respectively, in 1993 and 8.0%
and 5.0%, respectively, in 1992. The expected long-term rate of return on assets
was 8.5% for both 1993 and 1992.

(18) Other Employee Benefit Plans
The Corporation maintains a stock incentive plan which allows for the granting
of incentive and non-qualified stock options to all employees on a discretionary
basis. The Corporation also maintains a stock option plan under which no future
options will be granted, but under which previously granted options were
outstanding at December 31, 1993. Stock options are granted at prices equal to
the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options are exercisable
starting one year from the date of grant, or upon retirement, disability or
death, and expire seven years from the date of grant for options granted prior
to 1989 and ten years from the date of grant for options granted in 1989 and
thereafter. Effective in January 1992, all stock appreciation rights (SARs),
which had previously been granted in tandem with options, were canceled. No new
grants of SARs have been made since that time.

The following summarizes activity relating to options and SARs:

</TABLE>

On January 1, 1993, Crestar adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than

Pensions." Under this accounting rule, costs of retiree benefits other than
pensions are accrued in a manner similar to pension costs. Prior to 1993, these
other retiree benefit costs were expensed when paid, and totaled $1.7 million in
1992 and $1.2 million in 1991. The effect of adopting this statement was to
increase employee benefits expense for 1993 by approximately $2.1 million.
Postretirement benefits expense for periods prior to January 1, 1993 has not
been restated.
The following table presents the projected status of Crestar's postretirement
life and contributory health insurance benefit plans for eligible retirees as of
December 31, 1993:

In thousands
Accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations (other than pensions):
Retirees $(27,821)
Eligible active plan participants (5,599)
Ineligible active participants (7,740)
Total (41,160)
Unrecognized net loss 5,512
Unrecognized transition obligation
to be recognized over 20 years 32,490
Accrued postretirement benefit expense $ (3,158)

Postretirement benefit expense for the year ended December 31, 1993 included
these components:

In thousands
Service cost $ 573
Interest cost 2,131
Amortization of transition obligation 1,710
Net postretirement benefit expense $4,414

The weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered benefits for health insurance is 13% for 1994 and is assumed to decrease
gradually to 6% in 2000 and remain at that level thereafter. Increasing the
assumed health care trend rates by one percentage point in each year would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the medical plan
by approximately $2.5 million, and would increase the aggregate of the service
and interest components of net postretirement benefit expense by approximately
$250 thousand for 1993. The weighted average discount rate used in projecting
the accumulated plan benefit obligation was 7.25%, and the average rate of
annual compensation increase ranged from 5.0% to 7.8%, depending upon the age of
the participant.

The Corporation maintains a grantor trust to pay certain employee benefits as
they become due. Assets of the trust are restricted to use for applicable
employee benefit plans, including deferred compensation and medical benefit
plans. These trust assets of approximately $63 million at December 31, 1993 are
included in the Corporation's total assets.

The Corporation has a thrift plan and a profit-sharing plan covering
substantially all full-time employees beginning January 1 after date of hire.
The Corporation makes matching contributions of 50 cents for every $1 of
employee contributions to the thrift plan, up to 6 percent of base pay. Employer

profit-sharing contributions are determined by applying a formula based on
return on equity to covered compensation. Thrift and profit-sharing plan
expenses totaled $11.0 million, $8.3 million and $3.4 million in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112), "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," establishes accounting standards for
benefits provided to inactive or former employees after employment, but before
retirement. For Crestar, such benefits consist principally of short-term
disability benefits. Under the new standard, which becomes effective on January
1, 1994, estimated costs of postemployment benefits are accrued during the
period of active employment rather than expensed when paid. Crestar expects to
incur a pre-tax charge of approximately $2.0 million in the first quarter of
1994 upon adoption of this accounting standard.

(22) Commitments, Contingencies And Other Financial Instruments
In the normal course of business, Crestar is a party to commitments, contingent
liabilities and other financial instruments that are not reflected in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. Commitments to extend credit,
put options, standby letters of credit, interest rate caps, interest rate floors
and collars, interest rate swaps, and forward contracts are some of the vehicles
used by Crestar in meeting the financing needs of its customers and managing its
own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These items involve, to varying
degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Any losses which may result from
these transactions are not expected to have a material effect on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. Notional principal amounts often
are used to express the volume of the transaction, but the amounts potentially
subject to credit risk are much smaller.

The following table presents the contract or notional amount of each class of
instrument and the estimated unrealized gain (loss) of such instruments at
December 31, 1993 and 1992:

Forward contracts to hedge lending commitments 3,400 (5,247) 943,330 556,246
Total $ 25,335 $28,745 $3,449,686 $3,451,527
</TABLE>

Unless noted otherwise, the Corporation does not require collateral to support
off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk.

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a
customer which typically contain clauses that permit cancellation of the
commitment in the event of credit deterioration of the borrower. Standby letters
of credit are conditional commitments issued by Crestar to guarantee the
performance of customers to a third party. Crestar receives a commitment fee for
entering into such agreements.

The credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters
of credit is similar to direct lending; therefore, all of these items are
subject to the Corporation's loan approval and review procedures and policies.
Based upon management's credit evaluation of the customer, Crestar may require
the customer to provide various types of collateral as security for the
agreement, including balances on deposit, investment securities, real estate and
inventory.

The total contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements, since many of these items are expected to expire without being
drawn upon. At December 31, 1993, approximately $6.5 million of the standby
letters of credit and $20.9 million of commercial and similar letters of credit
were participated to other financial institutions.

A geographic concentration exists within Crestar's loan portfolio since most of
Crestar's business activity is with customers located in Virginia, Maryland or
Washington, DC. Based upon Standard Industrial Classification codes used for
regulatory purposes, the Corporation had no aggregate loan concentrations of 10%
or more of total loans in any particular industry at December 31, 1993. However,
under a broader view of the portfolio, Crestar had $1.1 billion in loans
outstanding to real estate developers and investors at year-end 1993. These
loans are diversified by geographic region within Crestar's market and by
project type and are made in accordance with the Corporation's normal credit and
underwriting guidelines and risk management policies.

The Corporation services mortgage loans other than those included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and, in some cases, accepts a
recourse liability on the serviced loans. At December 31, 1993, approximately
$376.8 million of the balance of these loans serviced with recourse is insured
by governmental agencies or private insurance companies.

Crestar has agreed to repurchase at the holder's option certain housing
authority bonds at par value under the terms of various tender option
agreements. Approximately $5.2 million of the $12.9 million in total repurchase
risk associated with this put bond program has been participated to another
financial institution.

The Corporation enters into a variety of interest rate cap, floor, collar, and
swap agreements as hedges (to manage its interest rate exposure) and as an
intermediary (to enable customers to transfer, modify or reduce their interest
rate risk). At December 31, 1993, the total notional amount of these instruments
that hedge the Corporation's interest rate risk was $2.1 billion, which included
$1.5 billion in swaps to convert certain variable-rate assets to fixed rates in
order to manage Crestar's interest sensitivity position: $55 million in swaps
utilized to convert specifically identified time deposits and short-term
borrowings to variable interest rates in order to lock in a spread on the
variable-rate assets that they fund; $4 million in swaps to hedge the interest
rate risk associated with the aforementioned tender option agreement; $400
million in caps to minimize interest rate risk associated with certain variable-
rate deposits and overnight securities; and $200 million of interest rate floor
agreements to minimize interest rate risk associated with variable rate assets.
The Corporation believes that such off-balance sheet transactions have been
successful in attaining interest rate sensitivity goals.

The following chart provides additional details on the interest rate swaps,
floors and caps utilized by Crestar at December 31, 1993 as hedges against
interest rate risk.

Total financial instruments

*Not applicable
</TABLE>

Interest rate floors and caps included in the above schedule are tied to the
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The average fixed strike rate at
December 31, 1993 for interest rate floors was 5.50%, and for interest rate caps
was 8.25%.

Credit risk associated with interest rate swaps, floors and caps is generally
limited to the estimated replacement cost of those instruments in a gain
position. No interest rate swaps, floors or caps used as hedges against interest
rate risk were sold by Crestar during 1993 or 1992.

At December 31, 1993, Crestar had entered into $385.3 million of interest rate
cap, floor, collar and swap agreements as a financial intermediary for
customers. As an intermediary, Crestar typically becomes a principal in the
exchange of interest payments between parties and, therefore, is exposed to loss
should one of the parties default. The Corporation performs normal credit
reviews on each counterparty and minimizes its exposure to the interest rate
risk inherent in these items by entering into offsetting positions or by using
hedging techniques to minimize risk. Notional principal amounts are used to
express the volume of the transaction, but the amounts potentially subject to
credit risk are much smaller and are limited to the value of the contractual
cash flows.

The Corporation entered into $943.3 million (contract amount) of forward
agreements to reduce the interest rate risk arising from changes in market rates
from the time various lending commitments are made until those commitments are
funded.

The fair values of off-balance sheet financial instruments were estimated based
on the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into
account the remaining terms of the agreements and creditworthiness of
counterparties. Unfunded loan commitments are generally priced at market at the
time of funding and are subject to certain credit standards. The carrying value
of interest rate caps, floors, collars and swaps used as hedges and other off-
balance sheet financial instruments was not material at year-end 1993 or 1992.

A large portion of Crestar's investment securities and securities held for sale
portfolios is comprised of mortgage-backed obligations issued by various Federal
agencies. At December 31, 1993 the total amount invested in these securities was
$1.5 billion or 41% of the combined investment securities and securities held
for sale portfolios.

Certain litigation is pending against Crestar. Management, after reviewing this
litigation with legal counsel, is of the opinion that these matters, when
resolved, will not have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

(23) Fair Value Of Financial Instruments
The majority of Crestar's assets and liabilities are financial instruments;

however, most of these financial instruments lack an available trading market.
Significant estimates, assumptions and present value calculations were therefore
used for purposes of the following disclosure, resulting in a great degree of
subjectivity inherent in the indicated fair value amounts. Comparability among
financial institutions may be difficult due to the wide range of permitted
valuation techniques and the numerous estimates and assumptions which must be
made. The Corporation's remaining assets and liabilities which are not
considered financial instruments have not been valued differently than has been
customary with historical cost accounting, nor have lines of business such as
trust or mortgage banking services been separately valued.

Valuation methods, estimated fair values and carrying values at December 31,
1993 and 1992 are as follows:

<TABLE>

Money market investments 650,633 1,181,032 650,633 1,181,032
</TABLE>

The fair values of cash and due from bank balances and of money market
investments are equal to the carrying values. Financial instrument assets
actively traded in a secondary market were valued using available quoted market
prices.

Other financial instrument assets 180,111 191,928 179,086 192,041
</TABLE>

The Company's loan portfolio was valued at discounted values of projected cash
flows. The applicable discount rates were based on rates paid on U.S. Treasury
securities with various maturity dates, adjusted for noninterest operating
costs, anticipated credit losses and prepayment risk. This valuation excludes
the additional value of customer relationships connected with Crestar's bank
card, home equity line or similar revolving line of credit arrangements. Other
financial instrument assets consist largely of customers' liability on
acceptances and accrued interest receivable, for which fair value approximates
carrying value. The fair value of other instruments was estimated based on
discounted values of projected cash flows.

<TABLE>

Deposits with no stated maturities $7,481,765 $6,760,060 $7,481,765 $6,760,060
</TABLE>

Deposit liabilities payable on demand, consisting of demand deposits, interest
checking deposits, money market deposit accounts and regular savings deposits,
by definition have an estimated fair value equal to carrying value. Recent
purchase transactions of bank deposits have reflected premiums of approximately
one to four percent of the recorded book value of total deposits. The premium
percent attributable to deposits with no stated maturities would be higher than
that range due to the low-cost nature of such deposits over their projected life
and their value as a low-cost source of funds.

Other financial instrument liabilities 200,230 284,795 200,276 284,886
</TABLE>

Deposits with stated maturities were valued using discounted cash flows
incorporating rates paid on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted for factors such
as operating expenses and prepayment risk. Short-term borrowings have a fair
value that approximates carrying value. Long-term debt was valued based on
interest rates currently available to Crestar for debt with similar terms and
remaining maturities. Other financial instrument liabilities consist largely of
liability on acceptances, interest payable on deposits, and balances due upon
settlement of securities purchases, for which estimated fair value approximately
carrying value. The fair value of other liability instruments was estimated
based on discounted net cash flows expected to be incurred. Information on
estimated fair values of off-balance sheet transactions is provided in financial
statement note 22.

The Board Of Directors And Shareholders
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crestar
Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in
shareholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1993. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosure in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Crestar Financial

Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its methods of accounting to
adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Statement On Corporate Responsibility
The financial statements on pages 32 to 56 have been prepared by management in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include some
amounts that are necessarily based on our best estimates and judgments. We are
responsible for the accuracy, integrity, objectivity, consistency and fair
presentation of the financial statements and all other financial information
contained in this Annual Report. One way we fulfill these responsibilities is by
relying on a system of internal controls, which has been designed to ensure that
transactions are properly authorized and recorded in our financial records.
Included in the system is an internal auditing function that independently
assesses the effectiveness of internal controls and recommends possible
improvements thereto. Because of inherent limitations in any system of controls,
there can be no absolute assurance that errors or irregularities will not occur.
Nevertheless, we believe that our system of internal controls provides
reasonable assurance as to the integrity and reliability of our financial
records.

Some of the financial information in this Annual Report is presented on a tax-
equivalent basis to improve comparative analysis. However, in all other
respects, it is consistent with the audited financial statements.

Through its Audit committee, which is composed of directors who are not officers
or employees of the Corporation, the Board of Directors fulfills its oversight
responsibility for determining that the accounting policies employed by
management in preparing the Corporation's financial statements are appropriate
and that our system of internal controls is adequately reviewed and maintained.
The Committee periodically reviews, with management and the internal auditors,
accounting policies, control procedures, and audit and regulatory examination
reports of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. In addition, our independent
auditors meet regularly with and have full and free access to the Committee,
privately and with management present, to discuss the results of their audits
and other auditing, accounting and financial reporting matters. The Committee
reports to the full Board after each of its meetings.

KPMG Peat Marwick have audited the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Their report, located above, represents their judgment as to whether
our consolidated financial statements present fairly our financial position and
results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

We are committed to ensure that corporate affairs are conducted in accordance

with consistently applied standards of conduct applicable to all officers and
associates. In essence, everyone is expected to manage their responsibilities
with integrity. Our standards provide guidance on general business conduct,
political activities, community involvement, outside employment and business
activities, conflict of interests, personal finances, and the use and safeguard
of confidential information.

Crestar Financial Corporation

Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Operations And Financial Condition
Crestar Financial Corporation And Subsidiaries

This commentary provides an overview of Crestar Financial Corporation's (Crestar
or the Corporation) financial condition, changes in financial condition and
results of operations for the years 1991 through 1993. The following discussion
should assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and supplemental financial information.

Earnings Overview
Crestar Financial Corporation reported net income of $140.5 million in 1993, a
76% increase over the $79.8 million earned in 1992. Net income for 1992 of $79.8
million was 136% higher than 1991. These increases reflected the continued
positive effects of lower credit costs, growth in noninterest income and
management of controllable expenses.

The key profitability measures of return on average assets and return on average
total shareholders' equity improved in 1993 over 1992 as a result of
significantly increased earnings. These ratios, along with other selected
earnings and balance sheet information for each of the years in the five-year
period ended December 31, 1993, are shown in Table 1.

Primary earnings per share of $3.68 in 1993 increased 59% over 1992 following an
increase of 137% in 1992. Significant items affecting the change in primary
earnings per share for 1993 and 1992 are summarized in Table 2. Each applicable
item is net of federal income taxes computed using a 35% rate for 1993 and a 34%
rate for 1992 and 1991.

Mergers And Acquisitions
During 1993, Crestar continued to enhance its presence in current markets
through the completion of two acquisitions and the announcement of five
additional acquisitions, two of which have been consummated in January 1994. In
May 1993, Crestar acquired CFS Financial Corporation (CFS), located in northern
Virginia. Initially, over $650 million in deposits and 19 branches were added to
Crestar's existing network. For the year ended December 31, 1993, the CFS
acquisition contributed approximately $.05 per share to consolidated earnings.
In June 1993, Crestar acquired from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
deposits and selected assets of City National Bank of Washington, a one-branch
institution closed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Total
deposits of approximately $21 million were acquired.

In January 1994, Crestar Mortgage Corporation acquired Mortgage Capital
Corporation, a privately held wholesale mortgage production company based in St.
Paul, Minnesota. Mortgage Capital Corporation originated approximately $500
million in residential mortgages in 1993. Also in January 1994, Crestar
Financial Corporation acquired Virginia Federal Savings Bank, headquartered in
Richmond, Virginia. Total deposits of approximately $500 million were added at
the time of acquisition. Financial results for 1993 do not include these two
1994 purchase method acquisitions.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, Crestar announced that it had signed definitive
agreements to purchase Providence Savings and Loan Association of Vienna, NVR
Savings Bank of McLean and Annapolis Bancorp, Inc. of Maryland. Deposits

totaling over $1.0 billion are expected to be added in 1994 as a result of these
three transactions. Financial statement note 2 contains additional information
concerning mergers and acquisitions.

Common Stock And Dividends
On December 31, 1993, Crestar's common stock price was $417/8, up 7% from the
December 31, 1992 closing price of $39. This growth compares favorably with the
performance of the Keefe Index, which increased 3%. The Keefe Index is a
composite of bank stocks tracked by Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., a widely
known banking industry analyst and investment banking company.

During the third quarter of 1993, Crestar's common stock began trading on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CF." Previously, Crestar common stock
was traded on the over-the-counter market and quoted on the National Market
System of NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations). Book value per common share was $28.32 at December 31, 1993. The
year-end common stock price of $417/8 was 1.48x book value. Total market
capitalization at December 31, 1993 was $1.6 billion. On the basis of 1993 fully
diluted earnings per share of $3.67 and the year-end market price of $417/8, the
December 31, 1993 price/earnings ratio was 11.4x.

Dividends declared in 1993 were $1.14 per common share, compared with $.80 per
share in 1992 ($.20 per quarter). Reflecting improved earnings, the common
dividend was increased three times during 1993. The current quarterly dividend
of $.33 per share, or $1.32 on an annualized basis, represents a level
equivalent to Crestar's pre-recession dividends declared. The Corporation's
objective is to pay dividends of approximately 30% to 40% of earnings to common
shareholders. Common dividends declared in 1993 were 31% of net income available
to common shareholders compared with 34% in 1992. In 1991, a year during which
economic conditions depressed earnings performance and asset growth, common
dividends declared represented 88% of net income available to common
shareholders.

Capital Resources And Adequacy
Crestar's capital position continued to strengthen as evidenced by significant
equity growth and strong capital ratios. Average shareholders' equity grew 24%,
6% and 2% in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The 1993 increase was primarily
attributable to higher earnings, the issuance of 1.4 million shares of common
stock in connection with the May 1993 CFS acquisition, and the October 1992
public issuance of 3.5 million shares which was not fully reflected in average
shareholders' equity until 1993. Two treasury stock programs, totaling 950,000
shares, were authorized in 1993. During the year, the Corporation purchased and
retired 522,300 shares of common stock at an average price of $40.31 per share,
primarily to meet the needs of the dividend reinvestment plan and in
anticipation of common stock to be issued in the 1994 purchase of Annapolis
Bancorp, Inc. In December 1993 all 900,000 shares of Crestar's Adjustable Rate
Preferred Stock Series B were redeemed with low-cost funds at 103% of the
stock's stated value, or $51.50 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
The Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity provide details
of these and other equity transactions.

Because 1993 growth in average equity of 24% outpaced the 6% growth in average
assets, the average equity to assets ratio increased more than 120 basis points
over 1992 and the year-end equity leverage ratio (defined as average total
assets divided by average total shareholders' equity) decreased from 14.20x in

1992 to 12.12x in 1993. Significant equity growth also affected other ratios, as
shown in Table 3. A key measure of equity's ability to absorb losses is the
ratio of average equity to average loans. This measure increased 271 basis
points to 15.19% for 1993. The equity formation rate (calculated as net income
less dividends declared divided by average total equity) increased to 9.24% in
1993 from 6.04% in 1992.

Risk-based capital ratios are another measure of capital adequacy. At December
31, 1993, Crestar's consolidated risk-adjusted capital ratios were 10.5% for
Tier 1 and 13.5% for total capital, well above the required minimums of 4.0% and
8.0%, respectively. These ratios are calculated using regulatory capital (either
Tier 1 or total capital) as the numerator and both on- and off-balance sheet
assets as the denominator. Tier 1 capital consists primarily of common equity
less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Total capital adds certain
debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses to Tier 1
capital. One of four risk weights, primarily based on credit risk, is applied to
both on- and off-balance sheet assets to determine the asset denominator. Under
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) rules, each of Crestar's three
subsidiary banks was considered "well-capitalized," the highest category of
capitalization defined by the regulators allowing for the lowest level of FDIC
insurance premium payments, as of December 31, 1993.

Additional regulatory capital measures include the Tier 1 leverage ratio and the
tangible leverage ratio. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital
divided by average total assets less goodwill and certain other intangibles and
has a regulatory minimum of 3.0%, with most institutions required to maintain a
ratio of at least 4.0% to 5.0% depending primarily upon risk profiles. At
December 31, 1993, Crestar's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.9%. The tangible
leverage ratio is calculated by excluding intangibles from both assets and
capital and is utilized by the Federal Reserve Board in evaluating proposals for
expansion or acquisitions. At December 31, 1993, Crestar's tangible leverage
ratio was 7.3%, well within accepted Federal Reserve Board ranges.

A double leverage ratio of over 100% measures the extent to which the equity
capital of subsidiaries is supported by Parent Company debt rather than equity.
Calculated as the investment in its subsidiaries divided by its own equity
accounts, Crestar Financial Corporation's double leverage was 97% at December
31, 1993, basically unchanged from 96% at December 31, 1992 and down from 100%
at December 31, 1991. Financial statement note 21 contains Parent Company
financial statements.

In September 1993, Crestar filed a shelf registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Under this registration statement, the
Corporation may issue in the future up to $300 million in subordinated debt
securities, preferred stock or common stock, or any combination thereof. Also in
September 1993, the 73/4% debentures due 1997 were redeemed at par value.

Net Interest Income And Net Interest Margin
The fundamental source of Crestar's earnings, net interest income, is defined as
the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting
those assets. Significant categories of earning assets are loans and securities
while deposits and short-term borrowings represent the major portion of
interest-bearing liabilities. The level of net interest income is impacted
primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities,
as well as changes in the levels of interest rates.

Net interest income in Table 4 is presented on a tax-equivalent basis to enhance
the comparability of assets with different tax attributes. This comparability is
achieved through increasing interest income on tax-exempt assets by an amount
equal to the Federal income taxes which would have been paid had the income been
fully taxable. This tax-equivalent adjustment is based on the applicable
statutory federal corporate income tax rate of 35% in 1993 and 34% in 1992 and
1991, and resulted in an increase to pre-tax income from earning assets in 1993,
1992 and 1991 of $12.6 million, $16.0 million and $22.1 million, respectively.
On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income increased $41.5 million or 8% in
1993 following a $54.9 million or 12% rise in 1992. These increases reflect an
increase in average earning assets of 6% in 1993 and 3% in 1992 as well as an
improved rate environment in both years.

The net interest margin is calculated as tax-equivalent net interest income
divided by average earning assets and represents the Corporation's net yield on
its earning assets. In 1993, the net interest margin of 4.78% improved 11 basis
points from 4.67% in 1992. From 1991 to 1992, the net interest margin improved
38 basis points, reflecting the benefit of substantial growth in core deposits.
Significant items affecting the change in the net interest margin from 1992 to
1993 are summarized in Table 5.

Positive influences on the 1993 margin resulted from a change in balance sheet
mix and lower levels of nonperforming assets. Changes in balance sheet mix
increased the 1993 net interest margin by approximately 29 basis points. On the
funding side, reduced higher-cost term deposits coupled with growth in
noninterest-bearing sources of funds (primarily shareholders' equity and net
demand deposits) provided a 17 basis point benefit to the 1993 net interest
margin. On the asset side, reduced levels of lower-yielding money market
investments and a shift in loan mix from commercial loans to higher-yielding
consumer loans aided the 1993 margin by approximately 12 basis points.

As nonperforming assets continued to decline, a corresponding decrease occurred
in their negative impact on the net interest margin. The lower levels of
nonperforming assets in 1993 had a favorable impact on the net interest margin
of approximately 8 basis points. Additional income of approximately $9.3 million
for 1993 and $22.7 million for 1992 would have been realized had all
nonperforming assets performed as originally expected.

The benefits from off-balance sheet hedging activities (primarily interest rate
swaps) declined in 1993 compared with 1992 as the notional principal on swaps
was reduced significantly in 1993 due to maturities. Off-balance sheet hedging
activities contributed $34.3 million to net interest income in 1993, compared
with $58.4 million in 1992. The reduction equated to a 23 basis point negative
impact on the 1993 net interest margin.

The May 1993 CFS acquisition added approximately $18.2 million to Crestar's 1993
net interest income. The impact on Crestar's 1993 net interest margin from CFS
was insignificant.

Provision And Allowance For Loan Losses
Both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses
are impacted by many factors, including general economic conditions, actual and
prospective credit losses, loan performance measures, historical trends, and
other circumstances, both internal and external. The amount of the provision for

loan losses is established based on evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses. Individual loan-by-loan reviews are performed on large
commercial and real estate exposures in lower quality regulatory risk ratings.
Smaller commercial and real estate credits are analyzed utilizing a formula-
based approach that encompasses the risk factors discussed above. Loan loss
allowances for the various consumer credit portfolios are based on historical
and anticipated losses and on current and projected characteristics of the
various portfolios. Management's evaluation and resulting provision and
allowance decisions are reviewed by the Board of Directors
on a quarterly basis.

Crestar's credit quality continued to reflect significant improvement in 1993.
Total credit costs, defined as the provision for loan losses and foreclosed
properties expense, were $81.8 million in 1993, a reduction of $77.6 million or
49% from $159.4 million in 1992. Crestar made provisions for loan losses of
$48.8 million in 1993, down $50.5 million or 51% from 1992. This paralleled a
53% decrease in the provision for loan losses in 1992. Poor economic conditions
and the accompanying deterioration in the quality of the commercial and real
estate loan portfolios resulted in a provision for loan losses of $209.5 million
in 1991.

As a result of the continued improved credit quality noted above, 1993 net
charge-offs of $64.8 million were down $49.1 million or 43% from 1992. In both
1993 and 1992, charge-offs related to real estate developers and investors
(REDI) contributed disproportionately to total net charge-offs, comprising 49%
of total net charge-offs in 1993 and 55% in 1992. The REDI designation is based
on borrower type and encompasses non-owner occupied real estate and construction
loans as well as other forms of credit extended to real estate developers or
investors. Total REDI charge-offs for 1993 were $31.8 million, down $31.1
million or 49% from 1992. As a percent of average REDI loans, net charge-offs
were 2.8% in 1993 and 5.0% in 1992. Current expectations are that the 1994 ratio
of total net charge-offs to average loans will improve from 1993, although
growth in consumer loan categories, which tend to have higher loss ratios than
commercial loans, may mitigate some of the improvement from real estate-related
losses. This expectation is based upon assumptions regarding the general
economic climate in Crestar's principal markets and the performance
characteristics of the loan portfolio, including Crestar's continued
success in resolving remaining nonperforming loans. Changes in these conditions
may produce different results.

The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1993 was $211 million,
representing 2.89% of year-end loans, and covering 218% of total nonperforming
assets and 264% of total nonperforming loans. Comparative measures at the end of
1992 were $205 million or 3.11% of loans, 93% coverage of total nonperforming
assets and 144% coverage of total nonperforming loans. Improvement in the two
coverage ratios was due to the significant reduction in nonperforming assets.
Detail of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the past five years
is shown in Table 6. Based on current expectations relative to portfolio
characteristics and performance measures including loss projections, management
considers the level of the allowance adequate. Although the allowance for loan
losses is a general allowance applicable to all loan categories, the allocation
provided in Table 6 is made to provide an indication of the relative risk
assessment of the components of the loan portfolio.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income increased 14% in 1993 following a 7% decrease in 1992.
Excluding securities gains, noninterest income increased $31.2 million or 15%
over 1992, compared with a 1992 increase of $29.2 million or 16% over 1991. The
1993 increase in noninterest income reflected growth in the core noninterest
income categories of trust and investment advisory income, service charges on
deposit accounts and bank card-related fee income, as well as higher mortgage
servicing and origination income. Trust and investment advisory income increased
$6.4 million or 13% over 1992 due primarily to a higher level of assets under
management. In 1993, trust assets held by Crestar's Trust and Investment
Management Group topped $30 billion, and assets under management totaled $8.4
billion at year-end 1993. Service charges on deposit accounts grew $5.5 million
or 7% over 1992. In 1992, increased income from service charges on deposit
accounts was the most significant contributing factor to higher
noninterest income excluding securities gains. These improvements for both years
reflected a higher transaction deposit base as well as price increases and
higher transaction volume. Bank card-related income rose $4.4 million or 19% in
1993 over 1992, aided by promotional activities that provided a 73% increase in
loan balances from year-end 1992 to 1993. Mortgage origination and servicing-
related income grew $7.6 million or 24% in 1993 following a $9.2 million or 40%
increase in 1992. In both years, higher origination volume generated during the
low interest rate environment and the related refinancing activity, as well as
gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights, contributed to the increases.
In 1993, mortgage originations totaled over $3.0 billion, compared with $2.5
billion in 1992. As a consequence, Crestar's loan servicing portfolio grew to
$6.7 billion at December 31, 1993 from $4.8 billion at year-end 1992.

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense increased $21.2 million or 4% in 1993 following an increase
of $96.2 million or 24% in 1992. Excluding foreclosed properties expense,
noninterest expense increased 11% in 1993 and 12% in 1992. The 1993 increase
reflected acquisition-related costs as well as expenses incurred in growing
noninterest revenue-generating businesses such as mortgage, investment banking
and bank card. Additional expenses arising from the CFS acquisition were
approximately $11.6 million for 1993. Expense increases in the mortgage and
investment banking and sales groups amounted to approximately $17.2 million over
1992, driven largely by refinance-related amortization of purchased mortgage
servicing rights and volume-based commission expense incentives. Expense
increases in the bank card group were approximately $5.8 million in 1993
reflecting direct promotional expenses and volume-driven staffing increases.
Excluding these direct expenses and the impact of foreclosed
properties expense, noninterest expense increased 4% in 1993.

Foreclosed properties expense of $33.1 million was down $27.1 million or 45%
from 1992. Market write-downs on foreclosed properties in 1993 were $4.5 million
versus $24.0 million in 1992. Net losses on the sale of foreclosed properties
were $4.9 million in 1993 compared with $1.6 million in 1992. A $6.4 million
provision for losses on foreclosed properties was recorded in 1993 compared with
a $12.0 million provision recorded in 1992.

Crestar adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106) in the
first quarter of 1993. The effect of adopting this statement was to increase
1993 employee benefit expense by approximately $2.1 million. Financial statement
note 18 contains additional information regarding SFAS 106.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" was issued in the fourth quarter of 1992. This
Statement, effective in 1994, relates to accounting for benefits provided to
former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement and requires
employers to recognize a liability for such benefits when certain conditions are
met. Crestar expects to incur a pre-tax charge of approximately $2.0 million in
the first quarter of 1994 upon adoption of this accounting standard.

Total capital expenditures for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were approximately $54.6
million, $45.9 million and $45.5 million, respectively. The 1993 figure included
expenditures for branch and office refurbishments, and new branch computer
technology. Expenditures in 1994 are anticipated to approximate $65.0 million
and will include amounts for the construction of a new headquarters building for
Crestar Mortgage Corporation.

Income Taxes
In 1993, income tax expense was $63.0 million, up from $19.7 million in 1992 and
$6.1 million in 1991. The 1993 increase was attributable to higher earnings. The
effective tax rates for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were 31.0%, 19.8% and 15.2%,
respectively.

Effective January 1, 1993, Crestar adopted the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." As shown in financial
statement note 13, the effect of adoption was a reduction of first quarter
income tax expense of $540 thousand. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are based on the differences between financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities. The tax effects of these differences are
measured using enacted tax rates that will be effective for the period during
which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided
against deferred tax assets if, and to the extent, it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. In management's
judgment, no valuation allowance was necessary at December 31, 1993. Deferred
tax expense is measured by the change in the net deferred tax assets or
liabilities for the period.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted in August 1993, changed
the federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1,
1993. The increase in the statutory tax rate did not have a material impact on
Crestar's 1993 income tax expense because the $1.8 million impact of the tax
rate increase was partially offset by a $1.6 million favorable deferred tax
adjustment resulting from revaluing the net deferred tax assets at the new
statutory rate.

Corporations are required to pay the greater of the regular corporate income tax
or the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The excess of the AMT over regular tax is,
generally, a credit available to reduce future income tax expense. In 1992,
income tax expense was reduced by $6.5 million by the utilization of 1991 and
1990 AMT credit carryforwards.

Liquidity And Interest Sensitivity
Bank liquidity is the ability to meet potential cash outflows promptly and in a
cost-effective manner. Liquidity is provided through the ability to generate new
deposits or borrowings as needed, longer-term investment securities that can
serve as collateral for borrowings, marketable short-term investments, and

maturing loans and investments.

Core deposits provide a typically stable source of liquidity. Interest-bearing
core deposits represented 65% of total funding sources at December 31, 1993
compared with 66% at December 31, 1992. Core deposits are supplemented by
additional sources of liquidity in the form of short-term borrowings and large
CDs, normally available from both national and local markets. While Crestar's
short-term borrowings consist largely of local funds, national sources are also
utilized to acquire term funds. Crestar's liquidity position is actively managed
on a daily basis, monitored regularly by the Asset/Liability Management
Committee (ALCO) and reviewed periodically with the Board of Directors. ALCO's
overall objective is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of
prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, the interest rate and economic
outlook, market opportunities, and customer requirements. General strategies to
accomplish this objective include maintaining a strong balance sheet, achieving
solid core deposit growth, accepting manageable interest rate risk, adhering to
conservative financial management practices and following prudent dividend
policies.

Interest sensitivity refers to the volatility of net interest income as a result
of changes in interest rates and is measured in several ways. Crestar's goal is
to limit interest rate exposure to prudent levels as determined by ALCO. The
primary tool used by ALCO is net interest income simulations. A two-year net
interest income forecast based on a "most likely" interest rate forecast is
prepared regularly, as are net interest income forecasts based on alternative
high and low interest rate scenarios. The expected dynamics of the balance
sheet, including shifts in loans and deposits, are included in simulations. The
high- and low-rate forecasts are compared to the "most likely" scenario. ALCO
evaluates and limits the amount of net interest income at risk in the high and
low scenarios.

A second interest sensitivity tool is the quantification of market value changes
for all assets and liabilities given an increase or decrease in interest rates.
This approach to interest rate risk provides a longer term view of the risk,
capturing all expected future cash flows. Assets and liabilities with option
characteristics are valued based on numerous interest rate path valuations. The
banking industry, including regulators, is moving toward a market value type of
interest sensitivity assessment. Crestar has been developing this tool and will
incorporate it as another component of interest rate risk management to
supplement the results achieved through simulation.

The final interest rate risk tool used by Crestar is the interest rate "gap," or
mismatch in repricing between interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, which
provides a general indication of interest sensitivity at a specific point in
time.
Although crude by today's standards, it remains the most commonly available
interest rate risk measurement technique. Table 9 reflects the earlier of the
maturity or repricing dates for various assets and liabilities at December 31,
1993. At that point in time, Crestar had a cumulative negative six-month gap
with $3.6 billion excess of interest-sensitive sources of funds over uses of
funds. This generally indicates that earnings should improve in a declining
interest rate environment as liabilities reprice more quickly than assets. The
opposite would be true of a positive, or asset-sensitive, gap.

In addition to the traditional gap measurement presentation, Table 9 also

presents interest sensitivity on an adjusted basis. The first of the adjustments
reflects the tendency for movements in consumer deposit rates to lag movements
in open market rates. This adjustment is made through the use of beta factors,
which recognize that certain consumer deposit rates are less interest-sensitive
than open market rates. These beta factors are based on a historic ratio of
actual changes in consumer deposit rates to changes in market rates. In addition
to a beta adjustment, the table also incorporates an adjustment to reflect the
sensitivity of much of the Corporation's commercial demand deposit balances to
the level of interest rates. On a cumulative six-month basis at December 31,
1993, Crestar had a negative adjusted gap of $1.0 billion excess of interest-
sensitive sources of funds over uses of funds.

The Corporation, in managing its interest rate risk, enters into a variety of
interest rate caps, floors and swaps. The Corporation performs normal credit
reviews on each counterparty when undertaking these transactions. Because
financial derivatives typically do not have actual principal dollars transferred
between parties, notional principal amounts are used to express the volume of
such transactions; however, amounts potentially subject to credit risk are much
smaller than the notional amounts. At December 31, 1993, the notional amount of
interest rate caps, floors and swaps (excluding customer positions where Crestar
acts simply as an intermediary) was $2.1 billion. Net unrealized gains on these
instruments totaled $21.2 million as of year-end 1993. Financial statement note
22 contains additional information pertaining to these types of agreements.

Estimated fair values of financial instruments held at December 31, 1993 and
1992 are presented in financial statement note 23. Management is concerned about
the comparability of fair value estimates between financial institutions due to
the wide range of valuation techniques utilized and the numerous estimates and
assumptions that must be made, given the absence of active secondary markets for
many financial instruments. This is particularly true for estimated fair values
computed for loan portfolios and deposit liabilities. Lack of uniform valuation
methodologies introduces a great degree of subjectivity to such fair value
estimates.

A brief description of the methodologies used in computing fair value estimates,
and the resulting estimated fair values, are provided in financial statement
note 23. Crestar's loan portfolio, which constitutes the Corporation's largest
financial instrument asset category, had an estimated fair value significantly
in excess of recorded book value at December 31, 1993. An environment of
decreasing interest rates, coupled with improving credit quality trends, were
major factors in the determination of the estimated fair value for net loans.
Deposit liabilities payable on short notice or demand, which constituted over
74% of Crestar's total deposits at December 31, 1993, were assigned an estimated
fair value equal to the balance payable on demand, in accordance with mandatory
accounting standards; however, recent purchase transactions of bank deposits
have generally reflected premiums of approximately 1% to 4% of recorded book
value, reflecting the relationship value of such deposits over their projected
life and their value as a low cost source of funds.

With respect to the investment securities portfolio, market value exceeded book
value at December 31, 1993 by $21.1 million, consisting of $23.1 million in
unrealized gain positions and $2.0 million in unrealized loss positions.
Securities held for sale were in a similar position, with market value exceeding
book value at December 31, 1993 by $32.8 million, consisting of $33.9 million in
unrealized gain positions and $1.1 million in unrealized loss positions.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115), will be adopted by
Crestar in the first quarter of 1994. In future reporting periods, securities
classified as available for sale will be reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains or losses (net of tax effect) excluded from earnings and reported as a
component of shareholders' equity. Upon implementation of SFAS 115 in the first
quarter of 1994, Crestar expects to classify approximately $2.9 billion of
securities with an unrealized gain of $46 million (as of January 1, 1994) as
securities available for sale. The total unrealized gain on securities available
for sale, net of deferred taxes, will be recorded as an increase to
shareholders' equity upon adoption of SFAS 115. The unrealized net gain (or
loss) on securities available for sale recorded as a component of shareholders'
equity will be subject to change in future periods due to fluctuations in market
values, acquisition activities, and sales, purchases, maturities and calls of
securities classified as available for sale.

Debt ratings are presented in Table 10. In the third quarter of 1993, Standard &
Poor's raised its ratings on Crestar's subordinated notes from BBB- to BBB. In
its announcement, Standard & Poor's cited Crestar's strong financial condition,
a continuing trend of improving profitability and conservative risk management
practices as reasons for the rating upgrade.

Sources Of Funds
Crestar's largest and most important funding source is core deposits, which
increased $607 million or 6% over December 31, 1992 compared with growth of 10%
in 1992. Total core deposits attributable to the May 1993 CFS acquisition were
approximately
$560 million at December 31, 1993. The largest increase over 1992 was in savings
accounts, which increased $325 million or 36%. Transaction accounts, which
include demand, interest checking and money market deposit accounts, grew $396
million or 7% over 1992. These increases reflect successful promotional
campaigns for the Crestar Key Account, an integrated account linking checking,
savings and money market accounts together on one statement, allowing combined
balances to reduce service charges. The increased savings and transaction
accounts were partially offset by declines in money market certificates, which
fell $63 million or 10%, and other domestic time deposits, which decreased 2%
from 1992. These declines reflect the low interest rate environment and consumer
preferences for short-term investments in such times. Crestar's acquisitions of
various financial institutions, as discussed in financial statement note 2, are
expected to add approximately $1.5 billion in deposits in 1994.

Purchased liabilities are composed of certificates of deposit of $100,000 and
over (large CDs), deposits in foreign offices, and short-term borrowings. Total
purchased liabilities decreased $14 million or 1% from December 31, 1992. The
mix of purchased liabilities continued to shift away from large CDs into short-
term borrowings, coinciding with liquidity needs and balance sheet management
strategies in a low interest rate environment. At December 31, 1993,
approximately 51% of Crestar's purchased funds consisted of funds invested by
local customers and, as such, are less volatile than other categories of
purchased funds. National sources accounted for 49% of purchased liabilities. At
December 31, 1993, Crestar had $2.4 billion market value of unpledged marketable
securities.

Uses Of Funds

Total earning assets at December 31, 1993 increased $692 million or 6% from
year-end 1992 compared with an 11% increase in 1992. The 1993 increase reflected
approximately $600 million related to the CFS acquisition. In 1992, higher
levels of securities held for sale, money market investments and mortgage loans
held for sale were partially offset by a decline in loans.

Total securities (both investment and held for sale) increased $293 million or
9% over December 31, 1992 partly due to acquired CFS securities. This followed a
$1.2 billion or 58% increase in 1992, primarily due to the purchase of U.S.
Treasury securities classified in the held for sale category. The composition of
long-term investment securities along with related yield and maturity
information as of December 31, 1993 is presented in Table 11. Both average
expected maturity and actual stated maturity are shown in Table 11. The average
expected maturity considers prepayments and amortization, resulting in a more
realistic measure of maturities than actual stated maturity. The "Other
interest-earning" category consists largely of collateralized mortgage
obligations and certificates of automobile collateralized receivables. Crestar's
holdings of tax-exempt securities have declined over the past five years and
management expects that trend to continue as maturities occur within the
portfolio. Table 12 presents the distribution of tax-exempt securities by
investment grade as determined by Moody's Investors Service. All
of the $5.0 million of securities shown as not rated by Moody's at year end are
rated A or better by Standard & Poor's. None of Crestar's securities holdings by
individual issuer (excluding U.S. Treasury and Federal agencies) exceeded 10% of
total shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993.

During 1993, over $350 million in U.S. Treasury securities and almost $15
million in adjustable rate preferred stock were sold from the held for sale
category for net gains of $2.2 million. In 1992, sales of government agency
mortgage-backed securities from the held for sale category resulted in gains of
$3.6 million.

Money market investments decreased a total of $530 million or 45% from December
31, 1992, reflecting an appropriate level of money market investments given
liquidity needs and balance sheet management strategies. In 1992, money market
investments increased $202 million or 21% over December 31, 1991 primarily in
the area of short-term U.S. Treasury securities, reflecting liquidity
enhancement measures as well as the investment of funds received from the
October 1992 stock issuance. Increased activity at Crestar Mortgage Corporation
contributed to a higher level of mortgage loans held for sale, which increased
$224 million over December 31, 1992.

Year-end total loans net of unearned income increased $705 million or 11% in
1993 after decreasing 7% in 1992. Period-end loans attributable to the CFS
acquisition were approximately $480 million. In 1992, loans decreased largely
due to the effects of a sluggish economy and weak loan demand. The largest
category of loans, commercial loans, remained relatively flat in 1993 following
a 13% decrease in 1992. The balance of tax-exempt loans continued to decline,
decreasing 20% in 1993. Instalment loans increased 13% in 1993, reflecting both
the CFS acquisition and internally generated growth in indirect loans. In 1992,
instalment loans decreased 1%. Bank card loans increased $412 million or 73% in
1993 as a result of the aforementioned promotional activity. In 1992, bank card
loans decreased 1%.

Real estate mortgage loans increased $194 million or 13% over 1992, and real

estate construction loans increased $10 million or 5% over last year, primarily
due to the CFS acquisition. Based upon Standard Industrial Classification codes
used for bank regulatory reporting purposes, the Corporation had no aggregate
loan concentrations of 10% or more of total loans in any particular industry at
year-end 1993. However, under a broader view of the portfolio, Crestar had $1.1
billion in REDI loans outstanding at year-end 1993 and 1992. This represented
16% and 17% of total loans at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Although
the balance of REDI loans at December 31, 1993 increased slightly from December
31, 1992, excluding $148 million acquired in connection with CFS, REDI balances
declined $144 million or 13% from 1992. Generally, REDI balances have shown a
downward trend over the past several years due to migration into foreclosed
properties, sales of projects, paydowns and pay-outs of construction and income
property projects, and charge-offs and write-downs. Diversification of the
portfolio by geographic region and by project type is detailed in Table 15.
Crestar's Greater Washington region comprises the largest portion of this
portfolio, with the primary exposure in this region being commercial in nature.
The second largest portion of Crestar's real estate portfolio is in its Eastern
region, with exposure in this region primarily in the residential sector.

Risk Elements
Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, formally restructured loans
and foreclosed properties. Generally, loans are placed in nonaccrual status when
principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier if it is known or
expected that interest will not be paid or collection of all principal and
interest is unlikely. Loans may be restructured as to rate, maturity or other
terms as determined on an individual credit basis. Properties are considered
foreclosed if acquired through traditional legal procedures or in settlement of
loans, or when the customer has abandoned the property to Crestar. Past due
loans are loans which are delinquent 90 days or more but which are currently not
in nonaccrual status based on various accounting and collectibility criteria.
Table 16 presents the level of these assets for the past five years and Tables
17 and 18 summarize quarterly activity in nonperforming loans and foreclosed
properties for 1993 and 1992.

At December 31, 1993, nonperforming assets of $96.8 million were down 56% from
December 31, 1992, despite $18.4 million of acquisition-related additions in
1993, $6.5 million of which was remaining at December 31, 1993. REDI
nonperforming assets totaled $62.3 million and comprised 64% of total
nonperforming assets and 5% of total REDI loans at December 31, 1993. REDI
nonperforming assets decreased 57% from December 31, 1992. Apart from the REDI
portfolio, commercial nonperforming assets declined steadily during the year and
consumer nonperforming assets were negligible throughout 1993. Foreclosed
properties at December 31, 1993 declined 78% from December 31, 1992. Included at
December 31, 1993 was a $5.6 million valuation allowance to address exposure to
prevailing market and economic conditions and the potential impact of such
conditions on the marketability of the portfolio. Total nonperforming assets at
December 31, 1994 are expected to drop slightly from December 31, 1993
barring an unexpected deterioration in the economy; however, interim periods in
1994 could show increases in total nonperforming balances due to announced
acquisitions.

Potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in
accordance with contractual terms but for which potential operating or financial
concerns of the obligors have caused management to have serious doubts regarding
the ability of such obligors to continue to comply with present repayment terms.

At December 31, 1993, such potential problem loans that are not included in
Table 16 as nonperforming or past due loans amounted to approximately $205
million. In addition, $14 million of standby letters of credit in various
industries were being monitored at December 31, 1993. Depending on changes in
the economy and other future events, these loans and others not presently
identified could be classified as nonperforming assets in the future. There are
no loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard, or
special mention that have not been disclosed above, that either (i) represent or
result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will
materially impact future operating results, liquidity or capital resources or
(ii) represent material credits about which management is aware of any
information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability
of such borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan" (SFAS 114). Effective January 1, 1995, SFAS 114 requires that
impaired loans within the scope of the statement be measured and reported on the
basis of the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate. Crestar currently believes the impact on results of
operations of adopting SFAS 114 will be immaterial.

Inflation
The effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different
than on non-banking companies since virtually all of a bank's assets and
liabilities are monetary in nature. In particular, interest rates are
significantly affected by inflation, but neither the timing nor magnitude of the
changes are directly related to price level indices; therefore, the Corporation
can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income
and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expenses.
