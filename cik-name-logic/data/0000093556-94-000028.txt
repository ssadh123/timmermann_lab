FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 19, 1994

STANLEY REPORTS RECORD RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER

New Britain, Connecticut...The Stanley Works today announced record
third quarter sales and earnings. Sales of $633 million in the third
quarter were 10% higher than the prior year. Net earnings were $32.2
million, or $.72 per share, representing a 29% increase over the same
quarter in 1993.

Richard H. Ayers, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, "The 10%
increase in third quarter sales was driven primarily by internal growth
of 9% spread across all businesses. Small price increases and net
acquisition and divestiture activity represented a 1% increase in sales
from the prior year. Currency had a positive but minor impact on
sales." 

Mr. Ayers added, "Our operating results continue to benefit from
increased sales volume generated by our worldwide growth initiatives and
favorable economic conditions. While all business segments realized
solid volume increases, the most notable improvements were in the
Specialty Hardware and Engineered Tools businesses."

Gross margins improved to 32.7% from 31.1% in the prior year, largely
the result of manufacturing efficiencies realized from increased volume,
especially in our Mechanics Tools business, and the successful
transition of previously foreign-sourced fastening tools to U.S.
in-house manufacture. Operating expenses were 22.1% of sales compared
with 21.9% in the previous year. Operating efficiencies achieved
through higher sales volume were offset by the costs of company
initiatives for long-term growth.

Interest-net expenses of $6.9 million were essentially unchanged from
last year despite higher interest rates in 1994. Other-net expenses of
$9.1 million included additional reserves established for environmental
remediation as well as the effects of divestiture activities in the
quarter. Other-net expenses of $3.6 million in the prior year included
a $5.0 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a non-operating asset which
was substantially offset by reserves established for the closing of a
manufacturing facility at our wholly-owned subsidiary, Mac Tools, Inc.

The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% compared with 41.7%
last year. The higher effective rate last year reflected the cumulative
effect of 1993 federal tax rate changes on the quarter.

Net sales for the first nine months of 1994 were $1.8 billion, an
increase of 9% over the $1.7 billion reported in the same period last
year. Net earnings for the period were $91.5 million, or $2.04 per
share, up 22% from net earnings of $75.0 million, or $1.67 per share
last year, before the effect of a change in accounting principle. 

Net sales in the U.S. increased 8% for the quarter. The increase
resulted from strong internal growth of 9%, a 1% price increase, and
divestiture activity, which decreased sales by 2% from the prior year.

Net sales in Europe increased 13% from last year. Unit volume gains
generated a 4% increase in sales and the incremental effect of an
acquisition added 3%. The recent strengthening in European currencies
increased sales by 6% in the quarter. Price increases continued to have
little impact on sales.

(page 3)

Net sales in Other Areas increased 15% for the quarter. In
ternal growth of 8% resulted from strengthening in our Canadian
businesses and our continuing growth in the Far East. Price increases,
when offset by the negative effects of currency, added 3% to sales. The
net incremental effect of acquisitions increased sales by 4%. Operating
profits of $7.9 million, or 8.6% of sales, were reduced from last year
as a result of increased expenses associated with our growth initiatives
throughout the Pacific Rim.

Net sales for the Tools segment increased 8% from the prior year. 
Internal growth of 7% was the primary contributor. While all businesses
experienced solid unit volume gains, these gains were most notable in
our Fastening Systems business. Price increases for the segment
resulted in a 2% sales increase with currency having a negligible
impact. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures decreased sales
by 1%. Operating profits increased 35% to $53.6 million and resulted in
operating margins of 11.5% compared with 9.3% in the prior year. The
improvement in operating profits is the result of increased sales
volume, operating efficiencies, and the successful transition of
previously foreign-sourced fastening products to in-house manufacture. 
In addition, the third quarter last year included one-time charges
related to the closing of a Mac Tools, Inc. manufacturing facility.

Net sales for the Hardware segment increased 7% from the prior year,
reflecting internal growth of 6% plus price increases and currency
effects of 1%. Operating profits increased 26% to $7.7 million. 
Operating margins improved to 9.7% from 8.3% last year.

Net sales for the Specialty Hardware segment increased 21% from the
prior year, exclusively from internal growth. Operating profit of $8.1
million was 17% higher than last year. Operating margins of 9.2% were
slightly below last year's margins of 9.4%, the result of growth
initiatives, primarily in Europe, of our Access Technologies business.

Commenting on the quarter and outlook for the year, Mr. Ayers stated: 
"We are pleased with our strong sales and earnings results for the
quarter and the first nine months of 1994. We are also pleased that
these results are in keeping with our expectations for both the quarter
and the year thus far." 

Mr. Ayers continued, "We attribute this strong performance to a
combination of factors. First, is our company-wide focus on profitable
growth, including geographic expansion and strategic investments in new
products and new markets. Second, is our long-term strategy to ensure
that the underlying structure of our company remains modern and
efficient, reflecting the appropriate use of technology to provide a
sound base from which we can continue to grow. Finally, 1994 has
provided improved economic conditions for our businesses worldwide. 
Based on these factors, we believe The Stanley Works will achieve the
significant full year sales and earnings growth that we had predicted at
the start of 1994."
