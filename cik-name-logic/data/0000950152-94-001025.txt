Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
------------------------------------- 

On September 30, 1994, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, an Ohio corporation 
("Cliffs"), acquired through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cliffs Minnesota 
Minerals Company, a Minnesota corporation ("CMMC") (Cliffs and CMMC 
collectively called "Buyers"), all of the outstanding shares of stock of Cyprus
Northshore Mining Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Northshore")
(consisting of 100 shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share), from
Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, a Delaware corporation ("Cyprus"). Northshore
in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cyprus Silver
Bay Power Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Power"). For the stock of
Northshore, Buyers made a cash payment to Cyprus of $66,000,000, plus an
estimated net working capital amount of $31,245,115.73, for a total of
$97,245,115.73. The Buyers paid for the acquisition from current cash and
marketable securities. An appropriate cash adjustment will be made
between the Buyers and Cyprus within forty-five (45) days of the closing date
to cover the difference between the estimated net working capital paid at
closing and actual net working capital determined upon receipt of actual
financial information as of the September 30, 1994 closing date, which
adjustment may be in either Cyprus or Buyers' favor. 

Northshore is primarily engaged in the production of iron ore pellets
and Power is primarily engaged in the retail and wholesale sale of electric
power. The principal assets of Northshore consist of an iron ore mine and
processing facilities, with a current annual capacity of four million tons of
iron ore pellets, supported by six million tons of annual concentrate capacity,
and the principal asset of Power consists of a 115 megawatt power generation 
plant. Cliffs intends that Northshore will continue its iron ore business as 
presently conducted.

Agreement or otherwise for or on account of Adverse
Consequences under Section 7(b) or 7(d), unless and until all
such damages in the aggregate exceed $1,000,000, in which case

of the aggregate of such claims over the initial $1,000,000 up
to a maximum of $11,000,000 of such claims.
