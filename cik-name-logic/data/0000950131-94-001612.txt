Heller Financial, Inc.
----------------------
Reports Growth in 1994 Third Quarter, Nine Month
------------------------------------------------
Net Income and Improvement in Nonearning Assets
-----------------------------------------------

Chicago -- (October 27, 1994) -- Heller Financial, Inc. reported growth in
both income before income taxes and net income for the 1994 three month and nine
month periods along with continuing improvement in nonearning assets, Michael S.
Blum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said today.

Income before income taxes was $49.7 million for the 1994 third quarter and
$132.5 million for the nine months, representing respective increases of 71
percent and 43 percent compared to the 1993 periods. Even with the company
approaching full taxpayer status in 1994, net income was $30.4 million for the
third quarter and $93.1 million for the nine months, reflecting growth of 8
percent and 3 percent from the year earlier periods.

Operating revenues of $145.2 million for the three months and $410.3 million
for the nine months were 14 percent and 7 percent higher than the prior year
periods due to growth in fees and other income from several product categories
and a third quarter increase in net interest income. Fees and other income grew
33 percent for the quarter and 25 percent for the nine-month period due to
increased revenues from real estate business initiatives, higher gains from
investments and higher revenues from asset-based

businesses. The increase in operating expenses principally reflects costs
related to business initiatives in the asset based product category as costs in
other core businesses decreased. As evidence of an improving portfolio, the
provision for losses in 1994 decreased 10 percent and 13 percent from the prior
year periods as the level of problem loans continued to recede and the
performance of financings originated since 1990 remained strong.

The company continues to make consistent progress toward improved asset
quality, one of its major goals. At September 30,1994, nonearning assets had
declined by $116 million, a 27 percent reduction from year-end 1993, and a $202
million reduction from a year ago. The ratio of total nonearning assets to
total lending assets was 4.0 percent at the end of the 1994 third quarter
compared to 5.9 percent at year-end 1993. The company's target range for
nonearning assets is from 3 percent to 5 percent.

"We continue to be optimistic about our long-term prospects due to the solid
growth the company has experienced thus far in 1994 combined with the ongoing
improvement in overall asset quality and the progress we've made in the area of
portfolio diversification," said Blum.

organization which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Fuji Bank, Limited, the
