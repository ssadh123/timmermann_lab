FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GIBSON SETTLES DERIVATIVES LITIGATION WITH BANKERS TRUST
--------------------------------------------------------

COMPANY TO RECORD $14.5 MILLION GAIN IN CURRENT QUARTER
-------------------------------------------------------

Gibson Greetings, Inc. (NASDAQ: GIBG) announced that it has
settled its claim against Bankers Trust Company for losses
arising from interest rate derivative transactions. As a
result of the settlement, Gibson will record a net pretax gain
of $14.5 million in the current quarter of its fiscal year
ending December 31, 1994.

Gibson first announced derivative losses on March 4, 1994 and
had recorded cumulative losses of $20.7 million on its two
remaining transactions at September 30, 1994. As part of the
settlement, the Company has paid Bankers Trust $6.18 million
which includes the reimbursement of approximately $3.4 million
of cash payments made to Gibson which had been recorded as gains
with respect to a number of earlier transactions. In return,
the remaining transactions will be terminated with no further
liability to Gibson.

"We are delighted with the settlement, which resolves all matters
in dispute with Bankers Trust and eliminates management distraction
and ongoing legal expenses," said Benjamin J. Sottile, Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Gibson.
