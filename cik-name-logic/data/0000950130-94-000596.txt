Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits
---------------------------------

On March 22, 1994 AmSouth Bancorporation ("AmSouth") filed a report on Form 8-K 
presenting pro forma financial statements giving effect to certain pending 
mergers and acquisitions as of December 31, 1993, as described in Item 5 of that
Form 8-K. AmSouth revised those pro forma financial statements to reflect 
the reclassification of certain liabilities and filed a Form 8-K/A on April 4,
1994 to amend the March 22, 1994 Form 8-K by substituting the pro forma
financial statements filed as part of that Form 8-K/A for the pro forma
financial statements filed with the March 22, 1994 Form 8-K. Due to a 
typographical error the amount of the "Other Borrowed Funds" shown in the 
"AmSouth and Fortune Pro Forma Combined" column of the Unaudited Pro Forma 
Combined Condensed Statement of Condition was incorrectly listed as "677,648" 
instead of "647,648." This form 8-K/A is being filed to substitute corrected 
pro forma financial statements for the pro forma financial statements that were 
part of the Form 8-K/A filed on April 4, 1994. 

Listed below are the financial statements and pro forma financial information
filed as part of this report.

(A) Financial Statements of Business Acquired:

None required.

(B) Pro Forma Financial Information:

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
are attached.

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Condition as of
December 31, 1993

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Earnings for the 
twelve months ended December 31, 1993.

(C) Exhibits:

None
<PAGE>

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of condition as
of December 31, 1993, gives effect to (i) the pending acquisitions of OBC,
FloridaBank, Parkway, Calhoun, and Citizens by AmSouth, assuming such
acquisitions are accounted for as poolings of interests, and (ii) the pending
acquisition of Fortune, assuming such acquisition is treated as a purchase for
accounting purposes, as if all such transactions had been consummated on
December 31, 1993. The effect of the Tampa acquisition is not expected to be
material to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of condition
and is not included.

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of earnings for
the twelve months ended December 31, 1993, gives effect to (i) the pending
acquisitions of OBC, FloridaBank, Parkway, Calhoun and Citizens assuming such
acquisitions are accounted for as poolings of interests, and (ii) the pending
acquisition of Fortune and the December 9, 1993 acquisition of Mid-State Federal
Savings Bank ("Mid-State Federal"), assuming that the acquisitions are treated
as purchases for accounting purposes, as if all such transactions had been
consummated on January 1, 1993. The effect of the Tampa acquisition is not
expected to be material to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement
of earnings and is not included.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are presented
for information purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the combined
financial position or results of operations which would actually have occurred
if the transactions had been consummated in the past or which may be obtained in
the future.

(1) To eliminate goodwill $ (10,272)

(2) To eliminate core deposit intangible (3,277)

(3) To establish income tax liability (1,000)

the assets and liabilities of Fortune estimated at fair values. Current
market values of investment securities were determined using publicly quoted
prices. Certain long-term fixed rate loans and deposits were valued based on
prevailing market interest rates. The final purchase accounting adjustments

change.

Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 125,841
-----------------
$ 280,606
=================
</TABLE>

The fair market value of the loans is approximately equal to the book 
value; therefore, no fair value adjustment is necessary.

Deferred taxes are established on the net difference between the fair 
value adjustments and the deductible portion of the estimated acquisition 
costs.

(C) Fortune stock options which are exercisable prior to the merger are
assumed to be exercised before the merger as follows:

<TABLE> 
<S> <C> 
Number of Fortune options outstanding 160,314
Average exercise price per share 16.00
------------------
Proceeds from exercise $ 2,565
==================
</TABLE> 

The impact upon Fortune's statement of condition as a result of the
exercise will be the issuance of 160,314 shares of $0.01 par value common
stock with a resulting $2 increase in common stock, a $2,563 increase in
capital surplus and a $2,565 increase in cash.

If the outstanding Fortune stock options are not exercised prior to the
merger, AmSouth has the option, on a case by case basis, to convert the
options into either (1) an option to purchase, on the same terms as the
Fortune common stock, shares of AmSouth Common Stock in an amount and at a
price appropriately adjusted to reflect the per share consideration
received by holders of Fortune common stock; or (2) cash in an amount
equal to the difference between (a) the per share consideration to be
received by holders of Fortune common stock in the merger and (b) the
exercise price of such option. The assumption that all of the Fortune
stock options will be exercised before the merger represents the most
dilutive outcome. If either option (1) or option (2) discussed above were
to occur, the pro forma combined condensed statement of condition and
statement of earnings would not be materially different from that
reported.

(D) Fortune's 10% subordinated convertible debentures are assumed to be
converted into Fortune common stock before the merger as follows:

<TABLE> 
<S> <C> 
Outstanding subordinated convertible debentures $ 17,044
Fortune conversion ratio 25.5
-----------------
Fortune shares issued upon conversion 668,000
=================
</TABLE> 

The impact upon Fortune's statement of condition as a result of the
conversion will be the issuance of approximately 668,000 shares of $0.01
par value common stock with a resulting $7 increase in common stock, a
$17,037 increase in capital surplus and a $17,044 reduction in other
borrowed funds.

(E) In connection with the acquistion, each common and preferred shareholder
of Fortune may make an election to receive either cash or AmSouth Common
Stock based on a formula which takes into consideration AmSouth's stock
price during a future pricing period. The transaction is valued at
$268,516, and the consideration will be comprised of approximately 50%
cash and 50% AmSouth Common Stock (subject to adjustment based upon the
average price per share of AmSouth Common Stock). The cash consideration
is assumed to be funded by AmSouth's issuance of $142,488 of long-term
debt at an assumed interest rate of 6.95%.

Based upon an average price per share of AmSouth Common Stock of $28.125,
approximately 4,481,000 shares of AmSouth Common Stock will be issued with
a resulting $4,481 increase to common stock and a $121,547 increase in
capital surplus. The remaining capital of Fortune, after all fair value
adjustments and accounting adjustments will be eliminated.

(F) To eliminate intercompany loan.

(G) Upon consummation of the merger with OBC, each share of OBC common stock
will be converted into 0.4907 of a share of AmSouth Common Stock. The OBC
transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, therefore the
effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase AmSouth shareholders'
equity by the total equity of OBC. The unaudited pro forma financial
statements have been prepared assuming that AmSouth will issue in the
aggregate 1,332,469 (0.4907 X 2,715,445) shares of AmSouth Common Stock to
the shareholders of OBC. A reclassification from capital surplus to common
stock results from the issuance of the shares.

(H) Upon consummation of the merger with FloridaBank, each share of
FloridaBank common stock will be converted into 0.4902 of a share of
AmSouth Common Stock. The FloridaBank transaction will be accounted for as
a pooling of interests; therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity
will be to increase AmSouth shareholders' equity by the total equity of
FloridaBank. The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been
prepared assuming that AmSouth will issue in the aggregate approximately
755,000 (0.4902 X 1,541,000) shares of AmSouth Common Stock to the
shareholders of FloridaBank. A reclassification from common stock to
capital surplus results from the issuance of the shares.

(I) Upon consummation of the merger with Parkway, each share of Parkway common
stock will be converted into 0.4886 of a share of AmSouth Common Stock.
The Parkway transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests;
therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase
AmSouth shareholders' equity by the total equity of Parkway. The unaudited
pro forma financial statements have been prepared assuming that AmSouth
will issue in the aggregate 489,597 (0.4886 X 1,002,041) shares of AmSouth
Common Stock to the shareholders of Parkway. A reclassification from
capital surplus to common stock results from the issuance of the shares.

(J) Parkway's mandatory 9% convertible subordinated debentures are assumed to
be converted into 163,750 shares of Parkway common stock which converts
into approximately 80,000 (0.4886 X 163,750) shares of AmSouth Common
Stock. The impact upon shareholders' equity is to increase common stock by
$80 and capital surplus by $1,230.
<PAGE>

(K) Upon consummation of the merger with Calhoun, each share of Calhoun common
stock will be converted into 0.9991 of a share of AmSouth Common Stock.
The Calhoun transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests;
therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase
AmSouth shareholders' equity by the total equity of Calhoun. The unaudited
pro forma financial statements have been prepared assuming that AmSouth
will issue in the aggregate 413,957 (0.9991 X 414,330) shares of AmSouth
Common Stock to the shareholders of Calhoun. A reclassification from
capital surplus to common stock results from the issuance of the shares.

(L) Upon consummation of the merger with Citizens, each share of Citizens
common stock will be converted into 0.3609 of a share of AmSouth Common
Stock. The Citizens transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests; therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity will be to
increase AmSouth shareholders' equity by the total equity of Citizens. The
unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared assuming that
AmSouth will issue in the aggregate 1,483,800 (0.3609 X 4,111,388) shares
of AmSouth Common Stock to the shareholders of Citizens. A
reclassification from capital surplus to common stock results from the
issuance of the shares.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS
TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993
(In Thousands Except Per Share Amounts)

(A) On December 9, 1993, Mid-State Federal was merged into AmSouth Bank of
Florida, a wholly owned subsidiary of AmSouth in a transaction accounted
for as a purchase under GAAP. Therefore, the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Statement of Condition at December 31, 1993, includes the
balances acquired from Mid-State Federal, as well as, the necessary
purchase accounting adjustments. Included in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Statement of Earnings for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1993, is the Mid-State Federal statement of earnings for the
twelve months ended September 30, 1993, the last available twelve month
period (which is representative of normal operations).

(B) Mid-State Federal's accretion and amortization of purchase price
adjustments resulting from the adjustments to estimated fair values, as
set forth below and included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Statement of Condition are as follows:

The expected decrease for each of the twelve months ended December 31,
indicated below, on future net income and shareholders' equity of the
projected aggregate purchase accounting adjustments reflected in the
accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
assuming the merger was consummated on January 1, 1993 are as follows:

</TABLE> 

The Excess of Cost Over Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired is being
amortized on a straight line basis over twenty years. The accretion
(amortization) of all other items is generally over a shorter period and on
an accelerated method. Therefore, the expected reduction in earnings and
shareholders' equity increases for each year ending December 31, 1994-1998.
