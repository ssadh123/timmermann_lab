<FN>
<F1>The write-off resulting from the Arizona Corporation Commission order
settling the Company's rate case resulted in a negative coverage ratio and
an earnings coverage deficiency of approximately $317 million at December
31, 1991. Excluding the effects of the write-off, the coverage ratio would
have been 2.11 for the same period.
