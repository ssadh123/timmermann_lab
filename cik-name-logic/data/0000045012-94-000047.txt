DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL HALLIBURTON
INDUSTRIAL SERVICES BUSINESS UNIT

DALLAS, Texas -- Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) today
announced that its subsidiary, Brown & Root Industrial Services,
Inc., has entered into a definitive agreement with HydroChem
Industrial Services, Inc. for the sale of such subsidiary's
Halliburton Industrial Services business unit for an undisclosed
amount. The closing of the sale, which is subject to receipt of
certain regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed by the
end of 1994.

The Halliburton Industrial Services business unit provides
chemical cleaning, hydrojetting and vacuum removal services to

revenues of approximately $45 million in 1993.

Thomas H. Cruikshank, chairman of the board and chief

Halliburton Industrial Services business unit is consistent with
other recently initiated actions to sell peripheral businesses
and to refocus resources on Halliburton's core energy services
and engineering and construction activities."
