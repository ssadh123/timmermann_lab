ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

As of January 27, 1994, TCI Communications, Inc. ("TCI") (formerly
Tele-Communications, Inc. or "Old TCI") and Liberty Media Corporation
("Liberty") entered into a definitive agreement to combine the two companies
(the "Mergers"). The transaction was consummated on August 4, 1994 and was
structured as a tax free exchange of Class A and Class B shares of both
companies and preferred stock of Liberty for like shares of a newly formed
holding company, Tele-Communications, Inc. (formerly TCI/Liberty Holding
Company or "Holding Company"). In connection with the Mergers, Old TCI changed
its name to TCI Communications, Inc. and Holding Company changed its name to
Tele-Communications, Inc. Old TCI common shareholders received one share of
Holding Company for each of their shares. Liberty common shareholders received
0.975 of a share of Holding Company for each of their shares. Holders of
Liberty Class E, 6% Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Junior Preferred Stock
("Liberty Class E Preferred Stock") received shares of a new preferred stock of
Holding Company having designations, preferences, rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions that are substantially identical to those of the
Liberty Class E Preferred Stock, except that the holders of the new preferred
stock will be entitled to one vote per share in any general election of
directors of Holding Company. The other classes of preferred stock of Liberty
held by Old TCI were converted into the right to receive that number of shares
of a new series of preferred stock of Holding Company having a substantially
equivalent fair market value. Historical and pro forma financial information
reflecting the Mergers is included herein under Item 7 of this Report.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As of August 8, 1994, Holding Company, TCI and TeleCable Corporation
("TeleCable") entered into a merger agreement, whereby TeleCable will be merged
into TCI. The aggregate purchase price of $1.6 billion will be paid with
shares of Holding Company Class A common stock (currently estimated to be
41,666,667 shares), assumption of liabilities amounting to approximately $300
million and shares of a Holding Company convertible preferred stock with an
aggregate initial liquidation value of $300 million. Such preferred stock
shall accrue dividends at 5-1/2% per annum, shall be convertible at the option
of its holders into 10 million shares of Holding Company Class A common stock
and shall be redeemable by Holding Company after 5 years. The merger requires
the approval of the shareholders of TeleCable and various franchise and
government authorities.

________________________________________________________________________________

(1) GENERAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Liberty Media Corporation, those of all majority-owned
subsidiaries and entities for which there is a controlling voting
interest ("Liberty" or the "Company"). All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

As of January 27, 1994, Liberty and TCI entered into a definitive
agreement to combine the two companies (the "Mergers"). The
transaction was consummated on August 4, 1994, and was structured as a
tax free exchange of Class A and Class B shares of both companies and
preferred stock of Liberty for like shares of a newly formed holding
company, TCI/Liberty Holding Company. In connection with the Mergers,
TCI ("Old TCI") changed its name to TCI Communications, Inc. and
TCI/Liberty Holding Company changed its name to Tele-Communications,
Inc. ("Holding Company"). Old TCI shareholders received one share of
Holding Company for each of their shares. Liberty common shareholders
received 0.975 of a share of Holding Company for each of their common
shares.

Liberty owned 2,988,009 shares of TCI Class A common stock and
3,537,712 shares of TCI Class B common stock. Upon consummation of
the Mergers, Liberty received 2,988,009 shares of Class A common stock
of Holding Company and 3,537,712 shares of Class B common stock of
Holding Company.

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements are
unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair
presentation of the results for such periods. The results of
operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of
results for the full year. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1993.

Other intangible assets include amounts assigned to long-term cable
contracts which provide for payments of distribution fees totaling
$33.2 million. These fees are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the terms of the agreements ranging from 5 to 15

years. Of the $33.2 million assigned to these contracts, $18.9
million represents contracts with TCI.

Certain amounts have been reclassified for comparability with the 1994
presentation.

In these notes to the consolidated financial statements, any reference
to TCI in connection with the issuance of the Company's preferred
stock includes subsidiaries of TCI.

(2) PRIMARY AND FULLY DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON AND COMMON
EQUIVALENT SHARE

Primary and fully diluted earnings attributable to common shareholders
per common and common equivalent share for the six months and three
months ended June 30, 1994 was computed by dividing net earnings
attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding (131,076,469 and 130,939,861, respectively).

Loss per common share attributable to common shareholders for the six
months and three months ended June 30, 1993 was computed by dividing
net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding (130,294,014 and 131,472,698,
respectively). Common stock equivalents were not included in the
computation of weighted average shares outstanding because their
inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

(3) SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

Cash paid for interest was $8,025,000 and $13,068,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Cash paid for
income taxes during the six months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 was
$7,581,000 and $5,241,000, respectively.

On November 11, 1993, Liberty entered into an agreement with the staff
of the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to which Liberty agreed to
divest all of its equity interests in QVC during an 18 month time period
if QVC was successful in its offer to buy Paramount Communications, Inc.
("Paramount") and not to vote or otherwise exercise or influence control
over QVC until such time as QVC withdrew its offer for Paramount.
Simultaneously, Liberty agreed to withdraw from a stockholders agreement
pursuant to which Liberty and certain other stockholders exercised
control over QVC (the "Stockholders' Agreement"). On February 15, 1994,
QVC terminated its offer for Paramount. Upon termination of such offer,
Liberty had the right to be reinstated as a party to the Stockholders'
Agreement so long as such option was exercised within 90 days after such
termination.

________________________________________________________________________________

On November 16, 1993, Liberty sold 1,690,041 shares of common stock of
QVC to Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") for aggregate consideration of
approximately $31,461,000. The sale to Comcast reduced Liberty's
interest in QVC common stock (on a fully diluted basis) from 21.6% to
18.5%. Liberty continued to account for its investment in QVC under the
equity method although it no longer exercised significant control over
such affiliate, due to the pending determination of whether the Company
would rejoin the control group under the Stockholders' Agreement. As a
result of the election on May 13, 1994, by Liberty to forego the
exercise of its option to be reinstated as a party to the Stockholders'
Agreement, Liberty began as of that date to account for its investment
in QVC under the cost method.

On August 5, 1994, Liberty, Comcast and QVC announced that they had
entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement")
pursuant to which Comcast and Liberty would acquire QVC. In accordance
with the Merger Agreement, Comcast and Liberty commenced a tender offer
for all shares of stock of QVC at a net cash price of $46 per share of
QVC Common Stock and a net cash price of $460 per share of QVC Preferred
Stock on August 11, 1994. Following expiration of the tender offer, a
corporation controlled by both Comcast and Liberty will merge with QVC
and any remaining shares of QVC will be converted into cash at the same
price as offered in the tender offer.

The total cost of the acquisition of the remainder of QVC stock not
currently owned by Comcast or Liberty and to pay certain fees and
expenses will be approximately $1.42 billion. Comcast and Liberty have
agreed to fund approximately $296 million and $20 million, respectively,
of the acquisition with the balance to be provided through debt
financing, which after the merger is expected to be an obligation of
QVC. The transaction is conditioned upon Comcast and Liberty obtaining
the requisite financing on satisfactory terms to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of QVC, upon receipt of certain governmental
approvals and other customary conditions. Should the transaction be
consummated, Liberty's investment in QVC would once again be accounted
for under the equity method.

Certain of the shares of stock of QVC owned by Liberty are subject to
repurchase by QVC in the event that commitments to carry its programming
are not met. Approximately 46% of the shares which the Company holds or
would hold upon exercise or conversion

of convertible securities, are "unvested" and are subject to such
repurchase rights by QVC. QVC's repurchase rights with respect to QVC
securities held by the Company are exercisable over a period of time,
ending in the year 2004, if certain carriage commitments made by
Satellite Services, Inc., ("SSI"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of TCI, are not met. Under the terms of a certain agreement pursuant to
which the Company acquired from TCI a substantial number of the QVC
securities it now beneficially owns, TCI has agreed to reimburse the
Company in the event QVC exercises its right to repurchase certain of
the "unvested" shares. Such reimbursement will be based on the value
assigned such shares when the Company acquired them from TCI, which is
substantially below the current market price of such shares.

Pursuant to an agreement among the Company, Comcast and Mr. Barry
Diller, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of QVC, ("Diller"), Diller
had the right, exercisable during a 30-day period beginning in June
1994, to purchase 1,627,934 shares of QVC Common Stock from the Company.
This right expired on July 11, 1994.

On July 11, Rainbow Program Enterprise ("Rainbow") purchased a 49.9%
general partnership interest in AMC from Liberty under the terms of a
buy/sell provision contained in the AMC partnership agreement. In
connection with the purchase, Rainbow acquired an option to purchase the
remaining 0.1% general partnership interest in AMC from Liberty for
approximately $373,000. The proceeds of $180,249,000 included the
economic benefit of Liberty's consulting agreement with AMC assigned by
Liberty to Cablevision Systems Corporation, the parent company of
Rainbow.

Certain of the Company's affiliates are general partnerships and any
subsidiary of the Company that is a general partner in a general
partnership is, as such, liable as a matter of partnership law for all
debts (other than non-recourse debts) of that partnership in the event
liabilities of that partnership were to exceed its assets.

(a) In December 1992, Home Shopping Network, Inc. ("HSN"), a cost
investment of the Company at that time and a consolidated
subsidiary of the Company at December 31, 1993, distributed the
capital stock of Silver King Communications, Inc. ("SKC"),
formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of HSN, to their stockholders
of record, including Liberty. This transaction was treated as a
stock dividend by HSN. At the time of said dividend,
intercompany indebtedness in an amount of approximately $135
million owed by SKC to HSN was converted into a secured
long-term senior loan to SKC (a cost investment of the Company).
Such loan is evidenced by a promissory note, the terms of which
are governed by a loan agreement and the liability evidenced
thereby is secured by substantially all of SKC's assets, and
bears interest on the unpaid principal amount at 9.5% per annum.
On August 1, 1994, SKC repaid the outstanding principal and
accrued interest to HSN.

Management of the Company estimates that the market value, calculated
utilizing a multiple of cash flow approach, agreed upon sales price or
publicly quoted market prices, of all of the Company's other investments
aggregated $752 million and $406 million at June 30, 1994 and December
31, 1993, respectively. No independent external appraisals were
conducted for those assets which were valued utilizing a multiple of
cash flow approach.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," ("Statement No. 115")
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. Under the
new rules, debt securities that the Company has both the positive intent
and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Debt
securities that the Company does not have the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale or trading and carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as
available-for-sale are carried as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as
trading are reported in earnings.

The Company applied the new rules beginning in the first quarter of
1994. Application of the new rules resulted in a net increase of
$44,392,000 to stockholders' equity as of March 31, 1994, adjusted to
$241,471,000 as of June 30, 1994, representing the recognition of
unrealized appreciation, net of taxes, for the Company's investment in
equity securities determined to be available-for-sale. However, the
unrealized holding gains do not include any unrealized gain associated
with the Company's investment in the aforementioned shares of common
stock of TCI, which were subsequently exchanged for shares of common
stock of Holding Company, as such common stock is deemed to be
restricted stock. Restricted stock, under Statement No. 115, is not
considered to have a readily determinable fair value. The majority of
the Company's available-for- sale securities as of June 30, 1994,
represents Liberty's investment in QVC, previously accounted for under
the equity method. The Company holds no debt securities.

(8) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

GENERAL

Liberty is authorized to issue 300,000,000 Class A shares and
100,000,000 Class B shares. Liberty had 87,515,378 Class A shares and
43,338,720 Class B shares outstanding at June 30, 1994, and December 31,
1993.

The Class A common stock has one vote per share and the Class B common
stock has ten votes per share. Each share of Class B common stock is
convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A
common stock.

STOCK OPTION

The Company has an employment agreement with an officer (who is also a
director). Pursuant to this agreement, such officer was granted an
option to acquire 100,000 shares of Liberty Class B common stock at a
purchase price of $256 per share (reflects actual shares issued). The
employment agreement was amended and the option was exercised with cash
and a $25,500,000 note. This note bears interest at 7.54% per annum.
During October 1991, such officer tendered to the Company in partial
payment of such note 800,000 shares of TCI Class B common stock,
resulting in a net reduction of $12,195,000 in the amount payable under
the note.

The 100,000 shares issued by Liberty upon exercise of this option,
together with all subsequent dividends and distributions thereon,
including shares issued in the Stock Splits (collectively totaling
16,000,000 shares of Liberty Class B common stock and 200,000 shares of
Class E Preferred Stock at December 31, 1993, the "Option Units"), are
subject to repurchase by the Company under certain circumstances. The
Company's repurchase right will terminate as to 20% of the Option Units
per year, commencing March 28, 1992, and will terminate as to all of the
Option Units in the event of death, disability or under certain other
circumstances.

On October 24, 1992, said officer of the Company entered into a letter
agreement with respect to the timing and method of payment under the
promissory note and the release

I-21 (continued)

________________________________________________________________________________

of the 200,000 shares of Class E Preferred Stock from the collateral
securing the promissory note. The remaining principal balance on the
note is approximately $14,500,000. The next scheduled payment will be
on October 24, 1994 in the principal amount of approximately $4,300,000
plus interest accrued from December 31, 1993 to the payment date.

STOCK PLAN

The Company has a Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") in order to
provide a special incentive to officers and other persons. Under the
Stock Plan, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
and other awards valued by reference to, or that are otherwise based on,
the value of Class A common stock may be granted in respect to a maximum
of 40,000,000 shares of Class A common stock. Shares to be delivered
under the Stock Plan will be available from authorized but unissued
shares of Class A common stock or from shares of Class A common stock
reacquired by the Company. Shares of Class A common stock that are
subject to options or other awards that terminate or expire unexercised
will return to the pool of such shares available for grant under the
Stock Plan.

In June 1993, the Company granted an aggregate of 56,000 non-qualified
stock options with stock appreciation rights to certain officers and key
employees under the Stock Plan. Each option is exercisable for one
share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $19.08. The
options vest in five equal annual installments commencing June 3, 1994
and expire in June 2003. Estimates of compensation relating to these
stock options with stock appreciation rights have been recorded through
June 30, 1994, but are subject to future adjustments based upon market
value and, ultimately, on the final determination of market value when
the rights are exercised.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

The Company has granted to certain of its officers stock appreciation
rights with respect to 2,240,000 shares of Liberty Class A common stock.
These rights have an adjusted strike price of $0.80 per share, become
exercisable and vest evenly over seven years. Stock appreciation rights
expire on March 28, 2001. Estimates of compensation relating to these
stock appreciation rights have been recorded through June 30, 1994, but
are subject to future adjustment based upon market value and,
ultimately, on the final determination of market value when the rights
are exercised. Stock appreciation rights with respect to 780,000 shares
have been exercised.

________________________________________________________________________________

In 1993, the President of HSN received stock appreciation rights with
respect to 984,876 shares of HSN's common stock at an exercise price of
$8.25 per share. These rights vest over a four year period and are
exercisable until February 23, 2003. The stock appreciation rights will
vest upon termination of employment other than for cause and will be
exercisable for up to one year following the termination of employment.
In the event of a change in ownership control of HSN, all unvested stock
appreciation rights will vest immediately prior to the change in control
and shall remain exercisable for a one year period. Stock appreciation
rights not exercised will expire to the extent not exercised. These
rights may be exercised for cash or, so long as HSN is a public company,
for shares of HSN's common stock equal to the excess of the fair market
value of each share of common stock over $8.25 at the exercise date.
The stock appreciation rights also will vest in the event of death or
disability.

Estimated compensation relating to these stock appreciation rights has
been recorded through June 30, 1994, but is subject to future adjustment
based upon market value, and ultimately, on the final determination of
market value when the rights are exercised.

(9) TRANSACTIONS WITH TCI

Certain subsidiaries of Liberty produce and/or distribute sports and
other programming to cable television operators (including TCI) and
others. Charges to TCI are based upon customary rates charged to
others.

Certain subsidiaries of Liberty purchase, at TCI's cost plus an
administrative fee, certain pay television and other programming through
a subsidiary of TCI. In addition, HSN pays a commission to TCI for
merchandise sales to customers who are subscribers of TCI's cable
systems. Aggregate commissions and charges to TCI were approximately
$11,248,000 and $4,391,000 for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

(10) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, DUE TO/FROM TCI,
PREPAID EXPENSES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES, SALES RETURNS 
AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE

The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments.

DEBT AND DEBT DUE TCI

The carrying amount approximates fair value.

PREFERRED STOCKS, SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION REQUIREMENTS

The fair values of the Company's preferred stocks subject to mandatory
redemption requirements were based on management's estimates. These
estimates were made by reference to the market values of other similar
publicly traded instruments. Neither independent external appraisals
nor dealer quotes were obtained. The estimated fair value of the
Company's preferred stocks subject to mandatory redemption at June 30,
1994 was $165,516,000.

LIMITATIONS

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot
be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect the estimates.

(11) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In February of 1991, the Company entered into an agreement with certain
of its stockholders which provides the Company the right upon the
occurrence of a "call triggering event" to require such persons to sell
the shares of Liberty common stock owned by them, and would provide such
persons the right upon the occurrence of a "put triggering event" to
sell their shares of Liberty common stock, in a registered public
offering or to one or more third parties selected by the Company. A
"call triggering event" consists of the issuance or adoption of a decree
by a governmental authority and the determination by an independent
committee of the Board of Directors that divestiture by any or all of
such persons of his or its Liberty common stock is necessary in order to
comply with the decree or is in the best interest of the Company in
light of material restrictions that would be imposed on the Company's
business absent such divestiture. A "put triggering event" consists of
the issuance or adoption of a decree by a governmental authority
requiring any or all of such persons to divest his or its shares of
Liberty common stock or TCI common stock or rendering such person's
continued ownership thereof illegal or subject to fine or penalty or
imposing material restrictions on

such person's full rights of ownership of such shares, provided that one
of the essential facts giving rise to such decree or that renders such
decree applicable to such person is the dual ownership by such person of
voting securities of both the Company and TCI. In each case, the
Company would guarantee the sale price for certain of the shares to be
sold. Liberty's rights and obligations under this agreement were
terminated upon consummation of the Mergers.

Liberty leases business offices, has entered into pole rental agreements
and transponder lease agreements, and uses certain equipment under lease
arrangements. In addition, as of June 30, 1994, the Company had
long-term sports program rights contracts which require payments through
1998 aggregating approximately $34,982,000.

The Company is obligated to pay fees for the license to exhibit certain
qualifying films that are released theatrically by various motion
picture studios through December 31, 2006 (the "Film License
Obligations"). As of June 30, 1994, these agreements require minimum
payments aggregating approximately $287 million. The aggregate amount
of the Film License Obligations is not currently estimable because such
amount is dependent upon the number of qualifying films produced by the
motion picture studios, the amount of United States theatrical film
rentals for such qualifying films, and certain other factors.
Nevertheless, the Company's aggregate payments under the Film License
Obligations could prove to be significant.

The following unaudited condensed pro forma balance sheet of TCI,
dated as of June 30, 1994, assumes that the Mergers, whereby TCI and Liberty
each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holding Company, had occurred as of
such date (see note 1).

In addition, the unaudited condensed pro forma statements of
operations of TCI for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and the year ended
December 31, 1993 assume that the Mergers had occurred prior to January 1,
1993.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the Mergers had occurred
prior to January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma financial statements of
TCI should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited pro forma
financial statements of Liberty and Holding Company and the related notes
thereto included elsewhere herein and the respective historical financial
statements and the related notes thereto of TCI and Liberty. The pro forma
financial statements of Holding Company represent a combination of the separate
pro forma statements of TCI and Liberty in giving effect to the Mergers.

(1) The Mergers were structured as a tax free exchange whereby the common
stock of Old TCI and Liberty and the preferred stock of Liberty were
exchanged for like shares of Holding Company. The Agreement provided
that each share of Old TCI's and Liberty's common stock (including
shares held by Old TCI's or Liberty's subsidiaries) would be converted
into one share and 0.975 of a share, respectively, of the
corresponding class of Holding Company's common stock. Shares of
Liberty Class E Preferred Stock were converted into shares of a
preferred stock of Holding Company having designations, preferences,
rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions substantially
identical to the shares of preferred stock being converted. Shares of
the remaining Liberty preferred stock held by subsidiaries of Old TCI
were converted into shares of a class or series of Holding Company
preferred stock having an equivalent value.

(2) Represents the conversion of Old TCI's investment in Liberty common
stock into an investment in Holding Company common stock and the
conversion of Old TCI's investment in Liberty preferred stock into an
investment in Holding Company preferred stock having an equivalent
value. Such amount is reflected as a reduction of stockholders'
equity due to its related party nature. Such conversion of shares is
reflected at the carryover basis of Old TCI's investment in Liberty.

(3) Reflects the reclassification to "Investment in Holding Company" of
79,335,038 shares of Old TCI Class A common stock held by subsidiaries
of TCI replaced with Holding Company common stock of the corresponding
class.

(4) Reflects the elimination of Old TCI's share of Liberty's historical
earnings. See note (2) above.

(5) Reflects the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

(6) Reflects the elimination of the preferred stock dividend requirement
on Old TCI preferred stock converted into common stock of Old TCI

The following unaudited condensed pro forma balance sheet of Liberty,
as of June 30, 1994, assumes Liberty had changed its accounting for its
investment in QVC, Inc. ("QVC") to the cost method and that the sale by Liberty
of the 49.9% partnership interest in American Movie Classics Company ("AMC")
had occurred as of such date. Additionally, such balance sheet also assumes
that the Mergers, whereby TCI and Liberty each became wholly-owned subsidiaries
of Holding Company, had occurred as of such date.

In addition, unaudited condensed pro forma combined statements of
operations of Liberty for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and for the year

prior to January 1, 1993:

(a) the change in accounting for Liberty's investment in QVC to
the cost method,

(b) the sale by Liberty of its 49.9% partnership interest in AMC,

(c) the Recapitalization Agreement, as defined in note 10,

(d) the acquisition of 20 million shares of Class B common stock
of Home Shopping Network, Inc. ("HSN"),

(e) the Tender, as defined in note 11,

(f) the acquisition of all general and limited partnership
interests in Mile Hi Cablevision Associates, Ltd. ("Mile Hi")
as described in note 12,

(g) the conversion of all the outstanding shares (10,974 shares)
of Liberty's Class A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Class A
Preferred Stock") into 4,405,678 shares of Liberty Class A
common stock and 55,070 shares of Class E, 6% Cumulative
Redeemable Exchangeable Junior Preferred Stock ("Class E
Preferred Stock"), and

(h) the Mergers.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the foregoing events had
actually occurred prior to January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma combined
financial statements of Liberty should be read in conjunction with the

(1) On July 11, 1994, Rainbow Program Enterprises ("Rainbow") purchased a
49.9% general partnership interest in AMC from Liberty under the terms
of a buy/sell provision contained in the AMC partnership agreement.
In connection with the purchase, Rainbow acquired an option to
purchase the remaining 0.1% general partnership interest in AMC from
Liberty for $373,000. The proceeds of $180,249,000 included the
economic benefit of Liberty's consulting agreement with AMC assigned
by Liberty to Cablevision Systems Corporation, the parent company of
Rainbow.

(2) On November 11, 1993, Liberty entered into an agreement with the staff
of the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to which Liberty agreed to
divest all of its equity interests in QVC during an 18 month time
period if QVC was successful in its offer to buy Paramount
Communications, Inc. ("Paramount") and not to vote or otherwise
exercise or influence control over QVC until such time as QVC withdrew
its offer for Paramount. Simultaneously, Liberty agreed to withdraw
from a stockholders agreement pursuant to which Liberty and certain
other stockholders exercised control over QVC (the "Stockholders'
Agreement"). On February 15, 1994, QVC terminated its offer for
Paramount. Upon termination of such offer, Liberty had the right to
be reinstated as a party to the Stockholders' Agreement so long as
such option was exercised within 90 days after such termination.

On November 16, 1993, Liberty sold 1,690,041 shares of common stock of
QVC to Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") for aggregate consideration of
approximately $31,461,000. The sale to Comcast reduced Liberty's
interest in QVC common stock (on a fully diluted basis) from 21.6% to
18.5%. Liberty continued to account for its investment in QVC under
the equity method, although it no longer exercised significant control
over such affiliate, due to the pending determination of whether the
Company would rejoin the control group under the Stockholders'
Agreement. As a result of the election on May 13, 1994 by Liberty to
forego the exercise of its option to be reinstated as a party to the
Stockholders' Agreement, Liberty began as of that date to account for
its investment in QVC under the cost method.

(3) Represents cash received from the sale of the 49.9% partnership
interest in AMC by Liberty, pursuant to the terms of the buy/sell
provision contained in the AMC partnership agreement (see note 1), and
the corresponding increase in investment in affiliates, payables and
accruals, and common stockholders' equity. Such increase in
investment in affiliates is due to a negative balance in Liberty's
carrying value due to distributions in excess of Liberty's basis in
such investment. The increase in payables and accruals represents the
estimated current income taxes payable on the sale. Increase in
deferred income taxes represents the reversal of the temporary
difference resulting from basis for income tax purposes in excess of
basis for financial statement purposes. The increase in common
stockholders' equity is due to the difference between Liberty's
carrying value of such investment and the purchase price of the same
reduced by the estimated income tax effect. Such gain ($183,208,000)
is not reflected in the pro forma combined statement of operations due
to its non-recurring nature.

(4) The Mergers were structured as a tax free exchange whereby the common
stock of Old TCI and Liberty and the preferred stock of Liberty were
exchanged for like shares of Holding Company. The Agreement provided
that each share of Old TCI's and Liberty's common stock (including
shares held by Old TCI's or Liberty's subsidiaries) would be converted
into one share and 0.975 of a share, respectively, of the
corresponding class of Holding Company's common stock. Shares of
Liberty Class E Preferred Stock were converted into shares of a
preferred stock of Holding Company having designations, preferences,
rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions substantially
identical to the shares of preferred stock being converted. Shares of
the remaining Liberty preferred stock held by subsidiaries of Old TCI
were converted into shares of a class or series of Holding Company
preferred stock having an equivalent value. Adjustment represents the
conversion of Liberty's investment in Old TCI common stock into an
investment in Holding Company common stock. Such amount is reflected
as a reduction of stockholders' equity due to its related party
nature. Such conversion of shares is reflected at the carryover basis
of Liberty's investment in Old TCI.

(5) Reflects the elimination of the historical preferred stock of Liberty
held by Old TCI or its subsidiaries. Such historical preferred stock
of Liberty was converted into Holding Company preferred stock having
an equivalent value. See note 4.

(6) Elimination of share of earnings of QVC through May 13, 1994.

(7) Elimination of share of earnings of AMC.

(8) Estimated income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

(9) Reflects the elimination of the preferred stock dividend requirement
on Liberty preferred stock converted into preferred stock of Holding
Company. See note 4.

(10) On June 3, 1993, Liberty completed the transaction contemplated by the
Recapitalization Agreement entered into on March 26, 1993 with certain
subsidiaries of TCI (such transaction is included in the Liberty
historical column of the pro forma balance sheet). Pursuant to the
Recapitalization Agreement, Liberty purchased 100% of the outstanding
shares of its Class C Redeemable, Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the
"Class C Preferred Stock") and 927,900 shares of its Class A common
stock. Liberty paid a purchase price of approximately $175 million
for the Class C Preferred stock and approximately $19 million for the
Class A common stock. The aggregate purchase price of approximately
$194 million was satisfied by delivery of $12 million in cash and four
promissory notes totaling $182 million. In the accompanying unaudited
condensed pro forma statements of operations, the preferred stock
dividend requirement on such purchased preferred stock has been
eliminated.

(11) On February 11, 1993, Liberty acquired from RMS Limited Partnership
20,000,000 shares of Class B common stock (the "Class B Stock") of HSN
for an aggregate purchase price of $58 million in cash and 8,000,000
shares of the Class A common stock of Liberty. Additionally, on June
1, 1993, Liberty completed the purchase of approximately 16 million
shares of the common stock ("Common Stock") of HSN at a price of $7.00
per share (the "Tender"). In addition, Liberty had acquired Common
Stock of HSN previous to the acquisition of the Class B Stock (such
transactions are included in the Liberty historical column of the pro
forma balance sheet).

(12) On March 15, 1993, Mile Hi Cable Partners, L.P. ("New Mile Hi")
completed the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of all the general and
limited partnership interests in Mile Hi, the owner of the cable
television system serving Denver, Colorado (such acquisition is
included in the Liberty historical column of the pro forma balance
sheet). New Mile Hi is a limited partnership formed among Community
Cable Television ("CCT") (78% limited partnership interest), Daniels
Communications, Inc. ("DCI") (1% limited partnership interest) and P &
B Johnson Corp. (21% general partnership interest), a corporation
controlled by Robert L. Johnson, a member of the Board of Directors of
Liberty. CCT is a general partnership in which a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Liberty is a 50.001% partner and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TCI is a 49.999% partner. New Mile Hi is a consolidated
subsidiary of Liberty for financial reporting purposes.

Prior to the Acquisition, Liberty, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
indirectly owned a 32.175% interest in Mile Hi through its ownership
of a limited partnership interest in Daniels & Associates Partners
Limited ("DAPL"), one of Mile Hi's general partners.

DAPL was liquidated on March 12, 1993, at which time a subsidiary of
Liberty (and partner in DAPL) received a liquidating distribution
consisting of a portion of DAPL's partnership interest in Mile Hi
representing the 32.175% interest in Mile Hi and a loan receivable of
approximately $50 million (the "Mile Hi Note").

Of the $110 million in cash required by New Mile Hi to complete the
transaction, $105 million was loaned to New Mile Hi by CCT and $5
million was provided by Mr. Johnson's corporation as a capital
contribution to New Mile Hi. Of the $5 million contributed by Mr.
Johnson's corporation, approximately $4 million was provided by CCT
through loans to Mr. Johnson and trusts for the benefit of his
children. CCT funded its loans to New Mile Hi and the Johnson
interests by drawing down $93 million under its revolving credit
facility and by borrowing $16 million from TCI in the form of a
subordinated note.

(13) Depreciation and amortization of the purchase price of Mile Hi and HSN
allocated to its tangible and intangible assets are based upon
weighted average lives of 12-1/2 years for tangible assets, 30 years
for intangible assets and 40 years for franchise costs.

(14) Represents interest on borrowings to finance the cash portion of the
consideration for the acquisition of the partnership interests in Mile
Hi and the interest on the promissory notes delivered to TCI pursuant
to the Recapitalization Agreement (see note 10). Interest on the
borrowings for the Mile Hi acquisition is calculated at the weighted
average rate of 6% in effect for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(15) Reflects the reduction in interest expense arising from the assumed
repayment of Mile Hi debt at January 1, 1993 and the elimination of
the intercompany interest expense recorded by Mile Hi on its debt to
CCT.

(16) Elimination of share of losses of Mile Hi through March 15, 1993.

(17) Represents the interest income on the loan to a minority partner (see
note 12).

(18) Represents the minority partners' 22% interest in the pro forma losses
of Mile Hi adjusted for the effects of the acquisition (see note 12).

(19) Represents the minority shareholders' 58.5% interest in the pro forma
losses of HSN (see note 11).

(20) Represents the preferred stock dividend requirement on the additional
shares of Class E Preferred Stock related to the conversion of all of
the outstanding shares (10,974 shares) of Liberty's Class A Preferred
Stock into 4,405,678 shares of Liberty Class A common stock and 55,070
shares of Class E Preferred Stock.

The following unaudited condensed pro forma balance sheet of Holding
Company, dated as of June 30, 1994, assumes that the Mergers, whereby TCI and
Liberty each became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Holding Company, had occurred
as of such date.

In addition, the unaudited condensed pro forma statements of
operations of Holding Company for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and the
year ended December 31, 1993 assume that the Mergers had occurred prior to
January 1, 1993.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the Mergers had occurred
prior to January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma financial statements of
Holding Company should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited pro
forma financial statements of TCI and Liberty and the related notes thereto
included elsewhere herein and the respective historical financial statements
and the related notes thereto of TCI and Liberty. The pro forma financial
statements of Holding Company represent a combination of the separate pro forma
statements of TCI and Liberty in giving effect to the Mergers.

MERGER VALUE; CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 3.1 Merger Value. Subject to adjustment
as provided in Section 3.2, the aggregate value of the consideration
deliverable by Parent in the Merger (the "Merger Value") shall be
$1,600,000,000 (the "Base Merger Value"), deliverable as follows: (i)
1,000,000 shares ($300,000,000 in aggregate initial

-3-
<PAGE> 9
liquidation value) of Preferred Stock of Parent having the designation, rights
and preferences set forth in a certificate of designation in the form attached
as Exhibit A (such class of stock, "Parent Preferred Stock"); and (ii) the
balance in shares of Class A Common Stock of Parent (such class of stock,
"Parent Common Stock" and, together with Parent Preferred Stock, "Parent
Stock").

Section 3.2 Adjustment of Merger Value.

(a) To determine the Merger Value, the Base Merger Value
shall be reduced by:

(i) the amount of Net Liabilities as of
the Effective Date; and

(ii) the amount, if any, by which
$1,540,000,000 exceeds 11.43 times Annualized EBITDA as of the
Effective Date.

(b) For purposes of this Section 3.2, "Net Liabilities"
means the difference, determined as of the Effective Date, without duplication,
between: (x)(i) all Liabilities (other than Liabilities for deferred taxes,
Income Taxes, dividends payable, deferred revenue from the sale of QVC stock,
and minority interests and any Liability caused by any action taken directly by
Parent or Sub or any Subsidiary of either of them (excluding actions taken by
any of them pursuant to this Agreement)) plus or minus (plus, if a payable, and
minus, if a

-4-
<PAGE> 10
receivable), (ii) all Income Taxes (excluding deferred taxes) receivable or
payable (excluding state and local income taxes arising as a result of
transactions described in Section 8.13 hereof) including, for any taxable
period that includes but does not end on the Effective Date, an accrual for
such Income Taxes through the Effective Date as if such period ended on the
Effective Date; and (y) (i) cash, cash equivalents, securities (excluding all
shares of the capital stock of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. held by the
Company) and accounts receivable (excluding notes payable to the Company by
executives of the Company in connection with purchases of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Company's Executive Stock Purchase Plans; provided, that, cash
obtained by the Company upon a sale or redemption of such notes shall not be
excluded from any calculation of Net Liabilities), plus (ii) prepaid expenses,
but only to the extent that the book value thereof can be realized after the
Effective Date. "Income Taxes" shall mean the Company's current but not
deferred federal, state and local income Taxes. The items taken into account
in the calculation of Net Liabilities, unless otherwise specifically provided,
shall be determined for the Company on a consolidated basis in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a basis consistent
with that applied in the preparation of the

-5-
<PAGE> 11
Company's financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(c) For purposes of this Section 3.2: (i) "EBITDA"
means, for any particular period, the earnings of the Company for such period,
determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, before "home office
operating expenses" and extraordinary items and before deduction therefrom of
any amount on account of interest, gain or loss on disposal of assets, Income
Taxes, depreciation and amortization and all amounts attributable to minority
interests in any Subsidiary that is not wholly owned, directly or indirectly,
by the Company, it being agreed that EBITDA shall be calculated in a manner
consistent with that used by the Company in estimating its "revised system cash
flow" for 1994, as set forth in a document entitled "TeleCable's Revised 1994
Budget" dated June 14, 1994, a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule
3.2(c); and (ii) "Annualized EBITDA" means, as of any date of determination,
400% of the EBITDA for the most recent period of three full calendar months
ended prior to such date.

Section 3.3 Adjustment Procedures.

(a) Not later than a date that the Company reasonably
believes is 20 business days prior to the Effective Date the Company shall
deliver to Parent a schedule, accompanied by all reasonably necessary
supporting information, setting forth the

-6-
<PAGE> 12
Company's reasonable and good faith estimates of Net Liabilities, Annualized
EBITDA and Merger Value, all such estimates to be as of the Effective Date.
Such schedule shall be accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial
officer of the Company to the effect that the estimates contained therein were
made in good faith and on a reasonable basis. Following receipt of such
schedule, Parent shall have 10 business days to review such schedule and
supporting information and to notify the Company of any disagreements with the
Company's estimates contained thereon. If Parent provides a notice of
disagreement with the Company's estimate of the Merger Value contained in such
schedule within such 10 business day period, Parent and the Company shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute and to reach an agreement
prior to the Effective Date on the estimated Merger Value as of the Effective
Date. The estimate so agreed upon by Parent and the Company or (if the parties
do not reach such an agreement on the estimated amount of the Merger Value
prior to the Effective Date or if Parent fails to provide a notice of
disagreement with the Company's estimate of the Merger Value within the time
provided) the estimate of the Merger Value contained in the schedule delivered
to Parent by the Company, shall be the basis for determining the amount of
Parent Common Stock issuable immediately after the Effective Date, subject to
further adjustment as provided in this Section. Not later than a

-7-
<PAGE> 13
date that the Company reasonably believes (and provides notice to the Parent at
least 5 business days before such date) is 45 business days prior to the
Effective Date, the Parent shall deliver to the Company a list (the "Prepayment
List") of all indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company that the Parent
desires the Surviving Corporation to prepay. The schedule delivered by the
Company pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall, in its calculation of Net
Liabilities, include as Liabilities, any penalties or premiums payable upon the
prepayment of the indebtedness included on the Prepayment List (whether or not
the Company has taken any action that would legally obligate the Company to pay
any such penalty or premium).

(b) Not later than 60 days following the Effective Date,
Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Shareholders' Representative a
schedule substantially in the form of the schedule described in subsection (a)
above providing detailed calculations, as of the Effective Date, of Net
Liabilities, Annualized EBITDA and the Merger Value, together with all
reasonably necessary supporting information. Such calculations shall be
accompanied by a certificate of a vice president of Parent that such
calculations were prepared in good faith and on a reasonable basis. With
respect to the indebtedness listed on the Prepayment List, the schedule
provided pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall reflect in its calculation

-8-
<PAGE> 14
of Net Liabilities only those penalties or premiums payable upon prepayment of
such indebtedness as the Surviving Corporation (i) has actually paid as of the
date such schedule is delivered or (ii) is, as of the date such schedule is
delivered, irrevocably legally obligated to pay thereafter.

(c) Following receipt of the information referred to in
subsection (b) above, Shareholders' Representative shall have 10 business days
to review such information and to notify Parent in writing of any disagreement
with Parent's calculations, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature and extent of such disagreement.

(d) If Shareholders' Representative fails to provide a
notice of disagreement with Parent's calculations of Net Liabilities,
Annualized EBITDA and the Merger Value within the period specified in
subsection (c) above, Parent's calculations thereof referred to in subsection
(b) above shall be final, conclusive and nonappealable.

(e) If Shareholders' Representative provides a notice of
disagreement with Parent's calculations within the period specified in
subsection (c) above, Parent and Shareholders' Representative shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve any such dispute for a period of 30 days following the
notification thereof. At the end of such period, if the dispute is not
resolved or the negotiation period has not been mutually

-9-
<PAGE> 15
extended, the matter shall be referred to an independent public accounting firm
selected by mutual agreement of the parties (or, if the parties cannot agree to
the selection of such a firm within 10 days after Shareholders' Representative
shall have provided a notice of disagreement, an independent public accounting
firm selected by mutual agreement of KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse),
which firm shall render its decision as to whether Parent's position is
correct, Shareholders' Representatives' position is correct or some position
between the two is correct (together with an explanation of the basis therefor)
to the parties to the dispute not later than 45 days following submission of
the dispute to it, which decision shall be final, conclusive and nonappealable.

(f) Upon the final determination of Net Liabilities,
Annualized EBITDA and the Merger Value pursuant to subsections (b)-(e) above,
(i) if the Merger Value as of the Effective Date is determined to be less than
the estimate of the Merger Value made pursuant to subsection (a) above, the
Merger Value shall be deemed to be reduced by the amount of the difference,
effective as of the Effective Date, and Certificates representing the number of
Holdback Shares, if any, remaining after subtracting from the total number of
Holdback Shares the number of Holdback Shares determined by dividing (x) such
reduction in the Merger Value by (y) $24.00, shall be delivered to the
shareholders of

-10-
<PAGE> 16
the Company entitled thereto or (ii) if the Merger Value as of the Effective
Date is determined to be greater than the estimate of Merger Value made
pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Parent shall issue to the shareholders of
the Company entitled thereto the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall include all the Holdback Shares) equal to the difference between (a) the
number of shares issuable upon final determination of the Merger Value (based
on a $24.00 price per share) and (b) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock previously issued to the shareholders of the Company based upon the
estimate of Merger Value pursuant to subsection (a) above.

(g) The Company and the Parent shall make the
calculations required pursuant to this Section 3.3 in a manner consistent with
the accounting practices and methodologies utilized by the Company in the
preparation of its December 31, 1993 audited financial statements.

Section 3.4 Conversion of Shares. As of the
Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of any common stock of the Company:

(a) Cancellation of Shares. All shares of Class A Common
Stock of the Company ("Company Class A Common Stock") and all shares of Class B
Common Stock of the Company ("Company Class B Common Stock" and collectively
with the Company Class A Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock") which are
held by the

-11-
<PAGE> 17
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, shall be
cancelled.

(b) Conversion Numbers. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (except shares
subject to Section 3.4(a)) shall be converted into and shall become (i) that
number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Common Conversion Number and (ii) that number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Preferred Stock equal to the Preferred
Conversion Number. For purposes of this Merger Agreement: (A) "Common
Conversion Number" means the number determined as of the Effective Date by
dividing (x) the quotient resulting from dividing the Merger Value, less
$300,000,000, by $24.00 by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding at the Effective Date, including as shares of Company Common
Stock deemed to be outstanding for purposes of calculating the Common
Conversion Number, without duplication, shares issuable pursuant to any
outstanding option, warrant, convertible security or other right to acquire
Company Common Stock issued or granted by the Company, whether or not then
exercisable or convertible, but excluding shares of Company Common Stock held
by any Subsidiary of the Company; and (B) "Preferred Conversion Number" means
the number determined as of the Effective Date by

-12-
<PAGE> 18
dividing (x) 1,000,000 by (y) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding at the Effective Date, including as shares of Company Common
Stock deemed to be outstanding for purposes of calculating the Preferred
Conversion Number, without duplication, shares issuable pursuant to any
outstanding option, warrant, convertible security or other right to acquire
Company Common Stock issued or granted by the Company, whether or not then
exercisable or convertible, but excluding shares of Company Common Stock held
by any Subsidiary of the Company.

(c) Adjustment to Conversion Numbers. (i) Except as
provided in subsection (ii) below, in the event of any stock dividend, stock
split, reclassification, recapitalization, combination or exchange of shares
after the date hereof with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Parent
Common Stock, the Common Conversion Number and the Preferred Conversion Number
shall be adjusted accordingly; (ii) with respect to any stock or rights
offering made to the holders of Parent Common Stock by the Parent or any
Affiliate of the Parent, all (but not less than all) of the holders of the
Company Common Stock shall, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
that are to be issued hereunder to them at the Effective Date, be entitled to
participate at the sole discretion of the Shareholders' Representative, for all
purposes, and subject to all requirements and limitations of such offering as
if they were holders of

-13-
<PAGE> 19
Parent Common Stock as of the relevant time, and receive the benefits of such
offering effective as of the Effective Date.

(d) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this
Merger Agreement to the contrary, but only in the circumstances and to the
extent provided by the VSCA, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date and that are held by
shareholders who were entitled to but did not vote such shares in favor of the
Merger and who shall have properly and timely delivered to the Company a
written demand for payment of the fair value of shares of Company Common Stock
in the manner provided in, and shall have complied with all of the relevant
provisions of, Sections 13.1-730 et seq. of the VSCA ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive, or be exchangeable for,
shares of Parent Stock. Instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 13.1-737 of the VSCA; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall subsequently withdraw his demand for payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares or (ii) if any holder fails to establish
and perfect his entitlement to the relief provided in such Section 13.1-735 of
the VSCA, the rights and obligations of such holder to receive such fair value
shall terminate, and such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into the right to receive, and to

-14-
<PAGE> 20
have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Date, shares of Parent Stock
in accordance with Section 3.4(b) hereof. Prior to the Effective Date, the
Company will not settle any demand with respect to any Dissenting Shares
without the consent of Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

(e) Holdback Shares. To effect the adjustments to the
Merger Value, Parent shall retain, out of the Parent Stock otherwise issuable
immediately after the Effective Date, 1,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
(the "Holdback Shares"), pending final determination of the Merger Value and
distribution of certificates representing that portion, if any, of the Holdback
Shares required to be delivered to the shareholders of the Company entitled
thereto, as provided in Section 3.3(f).

Section 3.5 Parent to Make Certificates
Available. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent shall select
Bank of New York, or such other Person or Persons reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to act as Exchange Agent for the Merger (the "Exchange Agent").
Prior to the Effective Date, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent
certificates ("Certificates") representing the Parent Stock to be delivered in
accordance with Section 3.4(b) hereof. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Date, each holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of one or more certificates
representing such stock for

-15-
<PAGE> 21
cancellation, certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock and Parent Preferred Stock into which such shares are converted in the
Merger and cash in consideration of fractional shares as provided in Section
3.7 hereof. Parent Stock (other than Holdback Shares not required to be
delivered) into which Company Common Stock shall be converted in the Merger
shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Date.

Section 3.6 Dividends; Transfer Taxes. Upon
surrender by a Person of the certificates representing Company Common Stock,
there shall be paid to such Person in whose name the Certificates representing
Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock shall be issued any dividends or
other distributions which shall have become payable with respect to such Parent
Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock in respect of a record date after the
Effective Date. Any transfer taxes payable by the holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger and the conversion of Company Common Stock
into Parent Stock shall be paid by the Parent except that any transfer taxes
payable as a result of the issuance of Parent Stock to a Person other than the
registered holder of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Date shall be
paid by the shareholder.

Section 3.7 No Fractional Shares. No
certificates or scrip representing any numbers other than a whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock shall be

-16-
<PAGE> 22
issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates representing Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(b) hereof. In lieu of any such fractional
share, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred
Stock upon surrender of certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock
for exchange, pursuant to Section 3.4(b) hereof, shall be paid upon such
surrender cash in an appropriate amount based upon the value of the Parent
Common Stock (determined by reference to the closing sale price thereof on the
last trading day preceding the Effective Date) and the initial liquidation
value of the Parent Preferred Stock.

Section 3.8 Shareholders' Approval. After the
Registration Statement has been declared and remains effective, the Company
shall take all action necessary, in accordance with applicable law and its
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, to have this Agreement and the
transaction contemplated hereby approved by the holders of capital stock of the
Company. The Company shall notify Parent of the date set for any shareholder
action to be taken in connection with approval of the Merger not later than 30
days prior to such date. Subject to Section 8.9 hereof, the Board of Directors
of the Company will recommend that holders of Company Common Stock vote in
favor of and approve the

-17-
<PAGE> 23
Merger and the adoption of this Merger Agreement at the Company Meeting.

Section 3.9 Closing of the Company's Transfer
Books. At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock shall be made
thereafter. In the event that, after the Effective Date, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock and/or cash as provided in
Sections 3.4(b) and 3.7.

Section 3.10 Assistance in Consummation of the
Merger. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company shall provide all reasonable
assistance to, and shall cooperate with, each other to bring about the
consummation of the Merger as soon as possible in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Merger Agreement. Parent shall cause Sub to perform all of
its obligations in connection with this Merger Agreement.

Section 3.11 Closing. The closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement shall take place (i) at the
offices of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, One Citicorp Center, 153 East 53rd Street,

incurred any unsatisfied withdrawal liability, as defined in Section 4201 of
ERISA, with respect to any multiemployer plan, nor has any of them incurred any
liability due to the termination or reorganization of any multiemployer plan,

the Code by the Internal Revenue Service, and to the Knowledge of the Company,
nothing has occurred with respect to any such plan since such determination
which could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such exemption or
the imposition of any material liability, penalty or

tax under ERISA or the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan has at all times been
maintained in all material respects, by its terms and in operation, in
accordance with all applicable laws.

(d) All contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) required to have
been made under the Company Benefit Plans or by law (without regard to any
waivers granted under Section 412 of the Code) to any funds or trusts
established thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the due
date thereof (including any valid extension), and no accumulated funding
deficiency exists with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans subject to
Section 412 of the Code.

(e) No Company Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV
of ERISA has: (i) an accumulated benefit obligation that exceeds the assets of
such plan, determined as of the last applicable annual valuation date using the
actuarial methods, factors and assumptions used for the most recent actuarial
report with respect to such plan prepared in accordance with Statement Number
87 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or (ii) been a plan with
respect to which there has been a "reportable event," as defined in Section
4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder, which would require the giving of
notice to the PBGC. Except for premiums paid to the PBGC, neither the Company
nor any Code Affiliate has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any

-38-
<PAGE> 44
liability under Section 4062 or 4063 of ERISA to the PBGC, or any trustee
appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA, except for any such liability which
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

reports, documents and notices to the participants or beneficiaries of the
Company Benefit Plans, except for such violations which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(g) There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits
which have been asserted or instituted against the Company Benefit Plans, the
assets of any of the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan
administrator, or against any fiduciary of the Company Benefit Plans with
respect to the operation of such plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor
does the Company have Knowledge of facts which could reasonably form the basis
for any such actions, claims or lawsuits, except for any such actions, claims
or lawsuits which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

-39-
<PAGE> 45

cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to provide indemnification to the
employees, officers and directors of the Company to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law in full force and effect for a period of not
less than six years from the Effective Date and (ii) subject to the occurrence
of the Effective Date, Parent hereby guarantees unconditionally full payment
and performance of such indemnification. In the event the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each

Division") for additional information or documentation and to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to all inquiries and requests received from
any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in connection with

Merger Agreement, the Parent and the Company shall take all such reasonably
necessary action.

(c) From and after the Effective Date, Parent shall

Voting Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit C and the holders of Common
Stock listed on Schedule 8.8(e)(ii) (which Schedule also lists the number of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock held by
each such holder) are entering into a Voting Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D. Further, the Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to
secure written agreements from the holders (including, without limitation,
those listed on Schedules 8.8(e)(i) and (ii)) of a sufficient number of shares
of Company Class A Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock to ensure
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 9.1(a) hereof, such
reasonable efforts to include the recommendation by the Chairman of the
Company's Board of Directors that such holders enter into such an agreement.

Section 8.9 No Solicitation. Subject to the
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company, as

-61-
<PAGE> 67
advised by outside counsel, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers, directors, representatives or agents shall
take any action to (i) initiate the submission of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
participate in negotiations with any Person in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly communicate to the Parent any solicitation
or inquiry received by the Company and the terms of any proposal or inquiry
that it may receive in respect of any Acquisition Proposal, or of any such
information requested from it or of any such negotiations or discussions being
sought to be initiated with it. "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposed
(A) merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (B)
sale, lease or other disposition directly or indirectly by merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise of all or any substantial part of
the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (C) issue, sale or other
disposition of securities representing 50% or more of the voting power of the
Company Common Stock or (D) any transaction in which any Person shall acquire
beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership or any "group" (as such term
is defined under the Exchange Act) shall have been formed

-62-
<PAGE> 68
which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 50%
or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock.

Section 8.10 Special Dividends. Notwithstanding
anything else in this Merger Agreement to the contrary:

(a) Prior to the Effective Date, the Company may, in lieu
of its Regular Company Dividends covering the period described in clause (i),
declare a special cash dividend on the Company Common Stock to holders of
record of such shares as of the record date established therefor (which record
date shall be prior to the Effective Date) with a payment date prior to or on
the Effective Date. Such special dividend may be in an amount per share not
greater than the product of (A) a fraction, (i) the numerator of which equals
the number of days between the record date with respect to the most recent
regular common stock dividend paid by the Company and the Effective Date and
(ii) the denominator of which equals 90, and (B) $.75.

(b) Upon written notice to Parent given within 45 days
after the date of this Merger Agreement, the Company may declare, in addition
to the special dividend described in subsection (a) of this Section, a special
cash dividend on the Company Common Stock to holders of record of such shares
on the record date established therefor (which record date shall be prior to
the Effective Date) with a payment date prior to the Effective Date in an
aggregate amount equal to "Free Cash Flow." "Free Cash

-63-
<PAGE> 69
Flow" means EBITDA less the sum of (i) the Company's home office expenses, (ii)
scheduled payments of interest and principal on indebtedness for borrowed money
and (iii) capital expenditures, in each case as determined for the period from
July 1, 1994 to the end of the most recent month ending prior to the Effective
Date for which the information necessary to calculate Free Cash Flow is then
available.

Section 8.11 Cancellation of Stock Restrictions.
Immediately prior to and contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, all of
the Company's rights to repurchase shares of Company Common Stock acquired by
the Company executives pursuant to the Company's Executive Stock Purchase Plans
in effect from time to time, at the formula price stock set forth in related
Stock Restriction Agreements entered into between the Company and such
executives, shall be cancelled. Schedule 8.11 lists the shareholders and the
number of shares to which this action relates. Because Parent Common Stock is
publicly traded and freely transferable, no purpose would be served in
continuing the Company's rights of repurchase. Accordingly, the Company,
Parent and Sub agree that such cancellation is noncompensatory and that no
consideration whatsoever will at any time be required to be provided to the
Company by the holders of Company Common Stock affected by such cancellation.
Because such cancellation is noncompensatory, the Company, Parent and Sub
irrevocably agree

-64-
<PAGE> 70
that no tax deduction, credit, claim for refund or tax benefit of any nature
will be claimed by reason of such cancellation in any individual or
consolidated tax return filed by any of them for any tax year. On or before 30
days following the Effective Date, Parent shall cause Sub to provide a written
statement to each of the shareholders listed on Schedule 8.11, which statement
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, which notice shall be
prepared by the Company and provided to Parent prior to the Effective Date.

Section 8.12 Information in Disclosure Documents,
Registration Statements, Etc. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company agrees that
none of the information supplied by it for inclusion in the Registration
Statement for the purpose of registering the shares of Parent Common Stock and
Parent Preferred Stock to be issued in the Merger and the Parent Common Stock
into which the Parent Preferred Stock is convertible, will at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective and at the Effective Date, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Parent
and Sub agree that the Registration Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the

-65-
<PAGE> 71
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

Section 8.13 Merger of Holding Companies into the
Company. Prior to the Effective Date the Company shall (i) cause its wholly
owned Subsidiary, TeleCable Investment Corporation, a Virginia corporation, to
merge with and into the Company's wholly owned Subsidiary, TeleCable
Technologies, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("TTI"), and (ii) thereafter cause
TTI to merge with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving
corporation.
