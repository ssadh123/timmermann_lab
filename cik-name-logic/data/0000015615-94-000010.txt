To the Boards of Directors and
Shareholders of Church & Tower Group

In our opinion, the combined financial statements listed in the accompanying 
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the 
Church & Tower Group at December 31, 1993, and the results of their operations 
and their cash flows for the year in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Group's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these 
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An 
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a 
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Report of Predecessor Independent Accountants

To the Boards of Directors and
Shareholders of Church & Tower Group

We have audited the combined financial statements of the Church & Tower Group 
listed in the accompanying index as of December 31, 1992 and for each of the 
two years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.

We did not audit the financial statements of 9001 Joint Venture, a joint venture
that is majority-owned by a company in the Group, for the years ended December 
31, 1992 and 1991. These statements reflect total assets of $3,064,573 as of 
December 31, 1992 and total revenues of $14,495,378 and $8,240,290 for each of 
the two years ended December 31, 1992, respectively. Those statements were 
audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our 
opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for 9001 Joint Venture,
is based solely on the reports of other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other 
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of other auditors, the 
combined financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Church & Tower Group as of December 31, 
1992 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the 
two years ended December 31, 1992 in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

CHURCH & TOWER GROUP
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991

1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Church & Tower Group (the Group) represents the combination of two Florida 
corporations, Church & Tower of Florida, Inc. (CT Florida) and Church & Tower,
Inc. (CT), which, prior to March 11, 1994, were owned by members of the Mas 
family. Effective March 11, 1994, the Group was acquired by Burnup & Sims Inc.
See Note 2.

CT Florida, established in 1969, is engaged in the construction and maintenance 
of outside plant (underground cable and conduit, aerial lines, manholes, etc.) 
for utility companies servicing the geographical areas of Dade and Broward 
counties in South Florida. CT, incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the 
State of Florida, engages in construction contracts and serves, primarily, as 
CT Florida's manpower and equipment subcontractor. 

CT Florida holds three Master Contracts with BellSouth Telecommunications (Bell
South). The contracts expire at various times through 1996, and provide for 
annual price revisions based on changes in the construction price index, as 
calculated and published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. CT Florida also 
provides construction services under individual contracts to Bell South and 
Miami-Dade Water & Sewer Authority (Miami-Dade).

In 1990, CT formed 9001 Joint Venture for the purpose of constructing a 
detention center for Metro-Dade County. From its initial 60% interest in the 
joint venture, CT increased its participation to 89.8% and 99.7% during 1991 
and 1992, respectively. Accordingly, the accounts of 9001 Joint Venture have 
been consolidated with the accounts of CT in the accompanying combined financial
statements.

Also in 1990, CT entered into a joint venture agreement with an international 
construction contractor. In this venture, CT has had a 20% interest in two 
governmental projects and accounts for its investment under the equity method.

Effective June 1, 1992, CT merged its operations with those of Communication 
Contractors, Inc. (CCI) in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of 
interests. CCI, also wholly owned by a member of the Mas family, provided 
construction subcontracting services (manpower and equipment) to CT Florida 
during the year ended December 31, 1991 and for the period from January 1, 1992 
through May 31, 1992. The accompanying financial statements for 1992 and 1991 
include the operations of CCI.

In the latter part of 1992, the Company entered into a joint venture for the 
removal of debris related to Hurricane Andrew. The Company has a 25% interest
in this venture and recorded approximately $1,087,000 of income during 1993 
related to its equity in the earnings of this venture. The venture was 
essentially completed in 1993.

A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of 
the accompanying combined financial statements is presented below:

Page 11 of 31
<PAGE>
CHURCH & TOWER GROUP
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991
(Continued)
Principles of combination

The combined financial statements include the accounts of CT Florida and CT and
their majority owned joint venture. All significant intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated.

Revenue recognition

Revenues and related costs for short term construction projects are recognized 
when the projects are completed.

Revenues from long term construction contracts are recognized under the 
percentage-of-completion method. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined.

Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are 
classified as current liabilities and represent billings in excess of revenues 
recognized.

Property and equipment, net

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated 
useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over 
the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the 
improvements. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. Expenditures for betterments and major improvements are 
capitalized.

Beginning in 1993, the Group changed prospectively the estimated useful life of 
construction and excavation equipment from 10 to 7 years. This change in 
estimated useful lives did not have a material effect on the 1993 financial 
statements.

Income taxes

CT Florida and CT have elected to be taxed under the Subchapter S provisions of 
the Internal Revenue Code, which provide that taxable income is to be included 
in the Federal income tax returns of the individual shareholders. Accordingly, 
no provision for income taxes has been recorded in the accompanying combined 
statements of income and retained earnings.

As explained in Note 2, the Group has been acquired by Burnup & Sims Inc. 
("Burnup"). As a result of this acquisition, the Group will be taxed as a C 
Corporation. Upon its change in tax status, the Group will record income taxes 
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the Group to use the liability 
method of accounting for income taxes based on temporary taxable and deductible 
differences between the tax bases of the Group's assets and liabilities and 
their financial reporting bases. The change in tax status by the Group is 
expected to result in a net deferred tax asset of approximately $435,000 due
to the tax effect of deductible temporary differences, principally related to 
certain provisions recorded at December 31, 1993 related to environmental and 
other matters.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991
(Continued)

Earnings per share

Earnings per share for the three years ended December 31, 1993, were computed 
using the number of shares outstanding after giving effect to the exchange of 
shares at March 11, 1994 as described in Notes 2 and 10.

Cash and cash equivalents

The Group has defined cash and cash equivalents as those highly liquid 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Environmental expenditures

Environmental expenditures that result from the remediation of an existing 
condition caused by past operations, that do not contribute to current or 
future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recognized when 
cleanup is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated.

Reclassifications

Certain accounts in the accompanying combined financial statements for the 
years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991 have been reclassified for comparative
purposes.

2 - ACQUISITION:

On October 15, 1993, the shareholders of the Group entered an agreement, as 
amended, pursuant to which the Group was acquired, through an exchange of 
stock, effective March 11, 1994, by Burnup, a publicly traded company with 
business activities similar to the Group. As a result of the acquisition,
the shareholders of the Group received approximately 65% of the shares of 
Burnup in exchange for 100% of the shares of CT and CT Florida. The reverse 
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of Burnup by the Group. The name 
of the resulting merged entity was changed to MasTec, Inc. ("MasTec"). The 
results of operations of the Group will be included with those of MasTec for
periods subsequent to the effective date of the acquisition. 

3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

The Group rents and purchases construction equipment from affiliates. During 
1993, 1992 and 1991, the Group incurred approximately $249,000, $222,000 and 
$497,000 of equipment rental expense and purchased approximately $1,432,000, 
$127,000 and $605,000, respectively, from these affiliates.

Additionally, at December 31, 1993 and 1992 the Group had recorded $97,450 and 
$42,839 as amounts due from affiliates. These amounts are included in accounts 
receivable in the accompanying combined balance sheets.

CHURCH & TOWER GROUP
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991
(Continued)

During 1993, the Group declared distributions to shareholders of $11,500,000. 
Of the amounts declared, $8,500,000 was paid in cash and $3,000,000 remains 
payable at December 31, 1993 in the form of notes payable to shareholders. The 
notes bear interest at the prime rate of interest plus 2% (8% at December 31, 
1993) and are payable in semi-annual instalments of $500,000 beginning in 
August 1994, plus accrued interest, through February 1998. The loans are 
unsecured.

The Group is a party to certain non-cancelable operating leases expiring 
October 1998 with an affiliate related to its equipment yards. Annual rental 
payments are $48,000. 

4 - SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:

The Group provides construction services primarily to BellSouth and Miami-Dade. 
As a result, the Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk with 
respect to these customers. Revenues from BellSouth and Miami-Dade for the 
years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 were approximately $29.1 million, 
$22.3 million and $15.7 million; and $4.4 million, $1.9 million and $1.1 
million, respectively. Accounts receivable from BellSouth and Miami-Dade at 
December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $3.3 million and $5.7 million; and $2.4 million 
and $108,000, respectively.

In addition, the Group, through its 9001 Joint Venture, recognized revenue from 
Metro-Dade County in connection with the construction of the detention center 
of approximately $10.7 million, $8.2 million and $14.4 million during the years 
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. At December 31, 1993 
and 1992 there were contracts receivable from Metro-Dade County in the amount 
of $400,000 and $2,542,833, respectively.

5 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:

The Group's operations are organized into two principal business segments - 
utility services and general construction. Income from operations consists of 
income before equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures and minority 
interest in earnings of consolidated joint venture. There are no material 
intersegment sales or transfers. Identifiable assets are those assets used for 
operations in each business segment. Corporate assets are principally invested 
cash and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.

12 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

In connection with certain construction contracts, the Company has signed 
certain agreements of indemnity in the aggregate amount of approximately $20 
million, of which approximately $9 million relate to the uncompleted portion of 
contracts in process. These agreements are to secure the fulfillment of 
obligations and performance of the related contracts. Management believes that 
no losses will be sustained from these agreements.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the Group's operation of 
underground fuel storage tanks. The Group is in the process of removing, 
restoring and upgrading these tanks, as required by the applicable laws, and 
has identified certain tanks and surrounding soil which will require remedial 
cleanups.

Under the terms of the contract with Metro-Dade County, the Group has provided 
a warranty to the County with respect to materials and workmanship for a one 
year period from the date of substantial completion, as defined in the 
contract. In management's opinion, no significant losses are expected as a 
result of this warranty.

Jorge Gamez, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Jorge A. Gamez,
deceased, vs. Church & Tower, Inc., a Florida corporation, et al. Civil Action
93-07318 CA 20, filed in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit in and
for Dade County, Florida on March 22, 1993, as amended on April 20, 1994, to
include MasTec, Inc. The claim alleges that a Group employee was negligent in
the operation of a truck and trailer combination which resulted in a death. 
Although no amounts are stated in the preliminary case filings, the plaintiff
has made a demand for $7.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Group provided approximately 
$2.3 million, net of $1 million of insurance coverage, related to the above 
matters. This amount has been included in other current liabilities in the 
accompanying combined balance sheet at December 31, 1993. Management believes, 
based on consultations with its legal and other advisors, that the amount 
provided is adequate to cover the estimated losses expected to be incurred in 
connection with these matters.

In November 1993, Albert H. Kahn (the "plaintiff") filed a class action and 
derivative complaint, Civil Action 13248, (the "1993 Complaint") against 
Burnup, the members of Burnup's Board of Directors, CT, CT Florida, Jorge Mas 
Canosa, Jorge Mas and Juan Carlos Mas (CT, CT Florida, Jorge Mas Canosa, Jorge 
Mas and Juan Carlos Mas are referred to as the "CT Defendants"). In December 
1993, plaintiff amended the 1993 Complaint ("1993 Amended Complaint"). 
The 1993 Amended Complaint alleges, among other things, that (i) the Burnup's 
Board of Directors and National Beverage Corp. ("NBC"), as Burnup's largest 
stockholder at the time, breached their respective fiduciary duties by approv-
the acquisition which, according to the allegations of the 1993 Complaint, 
benefits Mr. Caporella at the expense of Burnup's stockholders, (ii) the CT 
Defendants had knowledge of the fiduciary duties owed by NBC and Burnup's Board 

Page 19 of 31
<PAGE>

CHURCH & TOWER GROUP
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991
(Continued)

of Directors and knowingly and substantially participated in their breaches 
thereof, (iii) the Special Transaction Committee of Burnup's Board of Directors 
which approved the Acquisition Agreement and Redemption was not independent 
and, as such, was not in accordance with the 1990 Settlement, (iv) Burnup's 
Board of Directors breached its fiduciary duties by failing to take an active 
and direct role in the sale of the Company and failing to ensure the 
maximization of stockholder value in the sale of control of the company; and (v)
Burnup's Board of Directors and NBC, as Burnup's largest stockholder, breached 
their respective fiduciary duties by failing to disclose completely all material
information regarding the acquisition. The 1993 Complaint also claims 
derivatively that each member of Burnup's Board of Directors engaged in 
mismanagement, waste and breach of their fiduciary duties in managing Burnup's 
affairs. On November 29, 1993, plaintiff filed a motion for an order 
preliminarily and permanently enjoining the acquisition. On March 7, 1994, the
court heard arguments with respect to plaintiff's motion to enjoin the 
acquisition and on March 10, 1994, the court denied plaintiff's request for 
injunctive relief.

The Company believes that the allegations in the 1993 Complaint and the 1993 
Amended Complaint are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend this 
action.

Effective January 1994, the Group entered into a non-cancelable operating lease
for its office facilities. Future minimum rentals under the lease agreement
are $123,900 for 1994 and 1995.

13 - CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED):

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income of
Burnup and the CT Group for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1993 are 
presented as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 1992. The unaudited 
pro forma consolidated balance sheet is presented as if the acquisition had 
occurred on December 31, 1993.

The pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only and may not be 
indicative of the future results of operations or financial position of MasTec, 
or what the results of operations or financial position of MasTec would have 
been if the acquisition had occurred on the dates set forth.

These pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in 
conjunction with the historical combined financial statements and notes 
thereto of the CT Group included herein. 

Page 20 of 31
<PAGE>

As discussed in Note 1, the acquisition will be treated as a "reverse 
acquisition" for financial reporting purposes, with the CT Group considered to 
be the acquiring entity. As a result, the pro forma adjustments include 
adjustments to reflect the estimated fair values of the net assets of Burnup; 
the capital structure has been adjusted to reflect the outstanding capital 
structure of the surviving legal entity. MasTec has not yet finalized the 
allocation of the purchase price but believes that a substantial portion of 
the purchase price ultimately will be allocated to property and real estate 
investments. The purchase accounting adjustments have been made assuming a 
fair value of $5.60 per share for Burnup's Common Stock, which was determined 
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 "Business 
Combinations" using the average trading price for the period from the date the 
acquisition was announced to the date of consummation (March 11, 1994). The 
fair value approximates the price determined by the CT Group and Burnup in 
arriving at the number of shares to be issued. 

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are derived from 
the historical financial statements of Burnup and the CT Group. The pro forma 
consolidated balance sheet combines Burnup's January 31, 1994 balance 
sheet with the CT Group's December 31, 1993 balance sheet. The pro forma 
consolidated statements of income combine Burnup's historical statements of 
operations for the twelve months ended January 31, 1994 and 1993 with the CT 
Group's historical statements of income for the fiscal year ended December 
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
