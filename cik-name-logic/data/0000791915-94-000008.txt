Notes to Interim Financial Statements
September 30, 1993

1. Interim Statements:

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited
financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting
solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present
fairly the financial information included therein. While IC
Designs believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the
information not misleading, it is suggested that this financial
data be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,
1992.

2. Income Taxes:

IC Designs adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 (FAS109), "Accounting for Income Taxes". The adoption
of FAS109 changes the method of accounting for income taxes
from the deferred method (APB11) to an asset and liability
approach. The impact of adopting FAS109 was not significant.

<PAGE>19
Form 8

Item 7 (b) Pro Forma Financial Information
-------------------------------
Included are the unaudited pro forma condensed
balance sheet for Cypress Semiconductor
Corporation at September 27, 1993 and the
related pro forma statement of operations for the
nine month period ended September 27, 1993. Also
included is the pro forma statement of operations
for the year ended December 28, 1992.

On October 22, 1993, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock
of IC Designs, Inc. (ICD) for $16 million cash. ICD became a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the historical income
tax basis of its assets and liabilities carried over. In
connection with this acquisition, the Company also entered into
non-competition agreements ranging from one to five years with
certain directors and employees of ICD for an aggregate payment of
$4 million. In addition, a separate incentive compensation program
was established for the senior management of ICD providing for an
annual bonus pool based on ICD's future pretax profits.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects
the acquisition of ICD under the purchase method of accounting.
The pro forma financial information gives effect to the acquisition
as if the transaction had taken place on September 27, 1993 for the
pro forma condensed balance sheet and the beginning of 1992 for the
pro forma condensed statements of operations.

The unaudited pro forma statements of operations are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have
been achieved if the transaction had occurred on the dates
indicated and should not be construed as representative of future
operations. The historical financial statements of ICD are
included elsewhere in this filing, and the unaudited pro forma
financial information presented herein should be read in
conjunction with those financial statements and related notes.

NOTE 1. THE ACQUISITION

The total purchase price aggregates $20,300 (including
$300 of direct acquisition cost). The purchase price
has been allocated to ICD's assets and liabilities based on
the book value of ICD's current assets and liabilities, which
management believes approximates their fair value, and
independent appraisal for all other identifiable tangible and
intangible assets. The excess purchase price over the fair
value of identifiable assets and liabilities of $2,011
is recorded as goodwill.

Cash and short-term investments $ 3,671
Accounts receivable 2,024
Inventory 863
Other assets 48
Property and equipment 400
Completed technology 4,000
In-process technology 11,000
Covenants-not-to-compete 4,000
Goodwill 2,011
Accounts payable ( 1,082)
Other accrued liabilities ( 735)
Deferred taxes ( 5,900)

(c) To record intangible assets acquired at their fair value:

Completed technology $ 4,000
In-process technology of

(e) To reflect one-time charge for the fair value of in-process
technology (net of deferred taxes) and elimination of ICD
historical stockholder's equity:

One-time charge of $11,000 for

deferred taxes of $4,300) $ 6,700
Elimination of ICD's equity 5,065
----------
$ 11,765
==========
