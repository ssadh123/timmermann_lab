Form 8-K New England Telephone and Telegraph Company
January 24, 1994

ITEM 5. Other Events.

New England Telephone and Telegraph Company (the "Company") had net 
income of $81.3 million in 1993, compared with net income of 
$486.6 million for 1992. The 1993 results include after-tax charges 
of $414.0 million. The principal componets of these charges were: 
$291 million for business restructuring, primarily related to
efforts to redesign operations to improve efficiency and customer
service, including consolidation of work locations and lease
terminations, retraining employees, relocation expenses,
systems re-engineering, and other incremental costs associated
with work force reductions, including $240 million after-tax for
severance and post-retirement medical costs for employees leaving
the Company through 1996; approximately $85 million of after-tax 
restructure costs were allocated to the Company from a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Company and New York Telephone Company, Telesector 
Resources Group, Inc., primarily related to its restructuring; 
and $25 million for the Company's adoption of Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits", effective January 1, 1993.
The Company expects to reduce its work force by approximately
6,300 employees by the end of 1996.

Operating revenues were $4,070.2 million for 1993, up 3.8 percent 
from $3,921.9 million for 1992. Operating expenses in 1993 were 
$3,773.0 million. Excluding the effect of business restructuring 
and other charges, operating expenses for 1993 were 
$3,094.6 million, an increase of 2.8 percent from $3,009.2 million 
in 1992.

There were 5,905,968 access lines in service at December 31, 1993, 
an increase of 3.2 percent over the same period last year. The 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges, which reflects the effect of the 
restructuring charges, was 1.34 for the year ended December 31, 1993.

On February 17, 1994, the Board of Directors of NYNEX Corporation 
approved a special pension enhancement to the NYNEX Management 
Pension Plan. Eligible management employees who choose to retire 
through December 31, 1996 will be credited with an additional six 
years toward their age and six years toward their length of service 
for the purpose of determining pension eligibility and benefits. 
This enhancement, which will be offered at different times through 
1996 according to local force requirements, is expected to help the 
Company reduce the management portion of its work force. Any 
additional charges related to the pension enhancement will be 
recorded through 1996 as employees choose to retire under the plan.
