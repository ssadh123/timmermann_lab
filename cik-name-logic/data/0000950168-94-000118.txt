REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pilliod Holding Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pilliod
Holding
Company as of January 31, 1994 and May 1, 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the nine
month period
ended January 31, 1994 and the year ended May 1, 1993. These financial
statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Pilliod Holding Company at
January 31,
1994 and May 1, 1993 and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for
the nine month period ended January 31, 1994 and the year ended May 1, 1993
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in the nine
month period
ended January 31, 1994 the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes.

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Effective prior to the start of business on January 31, 1994, all
issued and outstanding
shares of the Company's common stock were acquired by LADD Furniture,
Inc. (LADD)
(the "Acquisition") (see Note 2). The consolidated financial
statements include all
transactions which occurred prior to the closing of the Acquisition.
All operations of the
Company on January 31, 1994 were for the benefit of LADD.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pilliod
Holding Company
(Company) and the combined accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary,
The Pilliod
Cabinet Company (Cabinet Company). Prior to the Acquisition, the
Company's fiscal
year ended on the Saturday nearest April 30.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost
or market.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment are
provided over the
estimated useful lives of the assets using both straight-line and
declining balance
methods.

Goodwill, which arose at the time of the March 19, 1985 acquisition of
Cabinet
Company, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.

Profit Sharing Plan

Substantially all of the Company's employees are participants in a
profit sharing plan.
Contributions to the plan are at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. Contributions of
$110,000 were made in fiscal 1994; no contributions were made in
fiscal 1993.

1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Changes in Method of Accounting for Income Taxes

In the nine month period ended January 31, 1994, the Company adopted
the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes,"
("SFAS No. 109"). As permitted by the Statement, prior year financial
statements were
restated effective with the March 19, 1985 acquisition of Cabinet
Company. Previous
accounting rules required that assets acquired in a business
combination be recorded at
their net-of-tax value and allowed the tax effects to be discounted.
SFAS No. 109 requires
that such acquired assets be recorded at their full assigned value
with offsetting deferred
taxes which may not be discounted.

Under the liability method required by the Statement, deferred tax
assets and liabilities
are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse.

2. Acquisition of the Company

Effective January 31, 1994 all issued and outstanding shares of the
Company's common
stock were acquired by LADD. In connection with the Acquisition, the
Company,
concurrent with the closing, repaid substantially all outstanding
long-term debt out of
funds provided by LADD. Prior to but as a result of the Acquisition,
the Company paid
management bonuses, redeemed all outstanding stock options and
incurred certain other
expenses, all of which are included in nonrecurring costs in the
accompanying 1994
statement of operations.

3. Concentration of Credit Risk

Cabinet Company is principally engaged in the business of furniture
manufacturing.
Substantially all accounts receivable are from department stores and
furniture retailers.
Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of credit
reports, payment
practices and, in most cases, financial condition. Collateral or
letters of credit are
generally not required. Credit losses are provided for in the
financial statements and
consistently have been within management's expectations.

F-8

<PAGE>

4. Inventories

Under the LIFO method, inventories have been reduced by approximately
$717 and $118
at January 31, 1994 and May 1, 1993, respectively, from amounts which
would have been
reported under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

5. Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consists of the following:

January 31, May 1,
1994 1993

Land and improvements $ 764 $ 730
Buildings 8,244 7,895
Machinery and equipment 19,502 18,031

payable monthly 3,000 3,000
Various equipment lease obligations, payable
monthly to August 1995 (see Note 6) 247 348

30,560 25,043
Amounts due within one year 4,568 4,661
$25,992 $20,382

All notes payable and long-term debt are classified in accordance with
their terms at
January 31, 1994 as if the Acquisition and related transactions
described in Note 2 had
not occurred. As a condition of the Acquisition, the Company, with
funds provided by
LADD, repaid substantially all notes payable and long-term debt
concurrent with the
closing on January 31, 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands)

6. Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt (continued)

On April 28, 1993 the Company entered into an agreement with the holders of its
subordinated notes to amend the notes. The agreement required the 
payment of all 
accrued and unpaid interest through February 18, 1993 and the 
forgiveness of $2,175 of
principal. The amended agreement required the payment of an additional
$1,000 if a
Change of Control Event occurred prior to April 28, 1994. Recognition
of gains on the
debt restructuring was deferred pending expiration of the contingency.
As a result of the
Acquisition, the $1,000 contingent payment became due and was paid by
the Company,
concurrent with the closing, out of funds provided by LADD. The
January 31, 1994 and
May 1, 1993 carrying value of the subordinated debt consists of
remaining principal
balance, expected interest over the life of the notes and net
contingent amounts payable.

7. Common Stock

In addition to the 9,000,000 shares of authorized Class A common
stock, the Company is
authorized to issue 9,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, of which
none have been
issued. The two classes of common stock entitle the holders to the
same rights and
privileges except that Class A common stock entitles the holder to
voting rights while
Class B common stock has no voting rights.

Shareholders of Class A common stock are permitted to exchange any or
all shares for
the same number of Class B shares and Class B holders are entitled to
convert any or all
shares into the same number of Class A shares within certain
limitations.

Prior to but as a result of the Acquisition, the Company redeemed all
1,310,000 stock
options then outstanding for aggregate consideration of $3,972.

Information on stock options is as follows:

Class A Shares Exercise
Under Option Price

Outstanding at May 2, 1992 and May 1,
1993
1,090,000 $.25 to $.85
Granted in 1994 220,000 $1.00
Redeemed in 1994 (1,310,000) $.25 to $1.00
Outstanding at January 31, 1994 --

8. Income Taxes

In the nine month period ended January 31, 1994, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 109.
The Statement requires the use of the asset and liability approach for
accounting and
reporting for income taxes. Financial statements for prior years were
restated effective
with the March 19, 1985 acquisition of the Cabinet Company. As a
result of the changes
in accounting for business combinations required by SFAS No. 109, the
restatement of
the acquisition of Cabinet Company resulted in additional goodwill
($1,840) and
additional costs allocated to property, plant and equipment ($505 net
of disposals
subsequent to March 19, 1985). Offsetting increased deferred tax
liabilities would have
been written off as a result of operating losses incurred subsequent
to March 19, 1985.
The net effect at May 2, 1992 of the additional depreciation of
property, plant and
equipment, the additional amortization of goodwill and deferred tax
provision credits
resulting from the writeoff of deferred tax liabilities was a
reduction in deficit of $1,612
from amounts previously reported. The effects of adoption on 1994 and
1993 results of
operations were not significant.

At January 31, 1994, the Company has operating loss carryforwards for
tax purposes of
approximately $4,555. Such carryforwards may be used to reduce
otherwise taxable
income until they expire beginning in 2005. Alternative minimum tax
credits of $149 are
available to offset future regular federal income tax liabilities and
do not expire.

8. Income Taxes (continued)

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences
between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's
deferred tax
assets and liabilities are as follows:

January 31, May 1,
1994 1993

Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carryforwards $1,731 $1,071
Accrued liabilities 277 400

Deferred taxes are classified as follows:

Noncurrent liabilities (605) (708)
Net deferred tax assets $ 599 $ --

A reconciliation of the provision (credit) for income taxes based on
the statutory U.S.
Federal tax rate to the consolidated provision (credit) for income
taxes is as follows:

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of
Earnings for the year ended January 1, 1994 and the Unaudited Pro
Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet as of January 1, 1994 give
effect to the Pilliod Holding Company and subsidiary (Pilliod
Furniture) acquisition and the other adjustments and assumptions
described in the notes to such combined condensed statements, as if
the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the year ended
January 1, 1994, in the case of the Statement of Earnings, and at
January 1, 1994, in the case of the Balance Sheet.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
relating to Pilliod Furniture is based on the audited historical
financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended
January 1, 1994 and on the audited historical financial statements
of Pilliod Furniture as of and for the nine months ended January
31, 1994, as well as the fourth quarter of the audited historical
financial statements of Pilliod Furniture as of and for the year
ended May 1, 1993. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial information gives effect to the acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting based on a purchase price of
$54,000,000 for the common stock, plus transaction expenses of
approximately $397,000, through the use of borrowings of
approximately $34,400,000 and proceeds from the sale of selected
trade accounts receivable for $20,000,000. The total purchase cost
of $54,397,000 was allocated first to the tangible assets and
liabilities of Pilliod Furniture based upon their respective fair
values and the remainder was allocated to the excess of cost over
the assigned value of net assets acquired. Additionally, the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
excludes from the historical results of Pilliod Furniture certain
non-recurring expenses incurred during 1993.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is
not necessarily indicative of future operations or the actual
results that would have occurred had the transaction been
consummated at the beginning of the year presented. Moreover,
valuations assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are preliminary and subject to change.
