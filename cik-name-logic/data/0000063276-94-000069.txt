MATTEL ANTICIPATES RECORD PROFITS FOR 1994,
ANNOUNCES CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING
AND DECELARES A STOCK SPLIT/DIVIDEND INCREASE
---------------------------------------------

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 19 -- Mattel, Inc. today said that the
company expects 1994 results from operations to be in line with
expectations, which will make 1994 its sixth consecutive year of
record sales and earnings. The company also announced a five-for-
four stock split, a dividend increase, and a corporate
restructuring designed to maximize the company's future
profitability.

The restructuring involves consolidation of manufacturing
operations and the reduction of headquarters expense and support
functions around the world, resulting in the elimination of
approximately 1,000 positions.

Earnings for 1994 will be impacted by a restructuring charge
of approximately $70 million, before taxes. By creating
efficiencies and eliminating redundancies, the restructuring
actions will produce estimated pre-tax savings of approximately
$25 million in 1995 and greater amounts thereafter.

"While corporate restructuring is often seen only during
difficult times, this action comes as we anticipate reporting
record results for the sixth consecutive year," John W. Amerman,
Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Our
balance sheet is strong and continues to improve. Importantly,
we have excellent momentum going into 1995.

"In just over one year we have successfully completed the
merger with Fisher-Price and the acquisition of Kransco and J.W.
Spear," Amerman said. "As a result of these transactions, plus
previous acquisitions, we have achieved significant savings
through integration. Now we have identified opportunities for
further efficiencies that will be produced by this
restructuring."

As a result of the stock split, shareholders will receive
one additional share of Mattel common stock for every four shares
they hold as of the January 6, 1995 record date, with shares
scheduled to be issued on January 20, 1995. The board of
directors of Mattel, Inc. indicated that it intends to maintain a
regular quarterly dividend of $.06 per share in 1995. This will
result in the equivalent of a 25 percent dividend increase
beginning with the dividend to be paid in the second quarter of
the year.

Mattel, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design,
manufacture and marketing of children's toys. The company's
principal brands of Barbie, Fisher-Price, Disney and Hot Wheels
together account for 80 percent of total sales. With
headquarters in El Segundo, California, Mattel has offices and
facilities in 34 foreign countries and sells its products in more
than 140 nations throughout the world.
