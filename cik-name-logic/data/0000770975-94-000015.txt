FIRST REPUBLIC BANCORP REPORTS
THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS 1994 RESULTS

Common Stock Symbol - FRC
New York/Pacific Exchanges

San Francisco, California, October 20, 1994 - First Republic Bancorp Inc.
today reported net income of $2,552,000 for the third quarter ended September 
30, 1994, compared with $3,427,000 for the same quarter in 1993. Fully diluted
earnings per share (EPS) were $0.28 for 1994, compared to $0.36 for the similar
period in 1993. 

Net income was $5,741,000 for the first nine months of 1994, after the 
provision of special reserves of $4 million in the first quarter and $1.25 
million in the third quarter related to the January 1994 Los Angeles 
earthquake. Net income was $9,018,000 for the first nine months of 1993. 
Fully diluted EPS for the nine month periods were $0.66 for 1994 and $0.97 for 
1993. The provisions of reserves related to the earthquake, net of tax 
benefits, reduced fully diluted EPS for the first nine months of 1994 by 
approximately $0.29.

At September 30, 1994, total capital was $188,512,000, up $15,109,000 
during the past 12 months. The Company's quarter-end ratio of capital to 
risk-adjusted assets was at the strong level of 16.52%. Tangible book value per
share was $14.29 at September 30, 1994.

Total assets of First Republic Bancorp Inc. were $1,638,666,000 at 
September 30, 1994. Substantially all of the Company's loan portfolio consists 
of adjustable rate, first trust deed, real estate secured California and Nevada 
loans, 82% of which are housing related.

For the third quarter, total interest income increased to $28,124,000 in 
1994 from $24,734,000 in 1993; net interest income was $9,270,000 in 1994 and 
$10,445,000 in 1993. The Company's net interest spread was 1.99% for the third 
quarter of 1994, compared to 2.24% for the second quarter of 1994 and 2.88% for 
all of 1993. In 1994, net interest spread 
<PAGE>
FIRST REPUBLIC BANCORP INC. Page 2

has declined to a lower level due to reduced yields earned on a larger 
percentage of new single family adjustable rate loans originated in 1994, the 
level of nonearning loans and loans earning a reduced rate as a result of the 
Los Angeles earthquake, and a continued emphasis on gathering deposits with 
maturities of one year or more in the face of increasing interest rates.

The Company's non-interest expense totalled $4,901,000 for the third 
quarter of 1994, compared to $5,129,000 for the same period in 1993. 
Non-interest expenses included $315,000 for the third quarter of 1994 and 
$846,000 for the third quarter of 1993 of costs and charges related to real 
estate owned ("REO") properties. As a percentage of average assets, the 
Company's general and administrative expenses were 1.15% for the third quarter 
of 1994, compared to 1.28% for the second quarter of 1994 and 1.47% for the 
first quarter of 1994. The decline in this ratio for 1994 results from asset 
growth and successful cost control measures begun during the second quarter of 
1994.

For the third quarter of 1994, the Company originated $172,209,000 of 
loans, compared with $238,075,000 for the same period in 1993. Total loans 
originated for the first nine months were $623,763,000 in 1994 and 
$626,295,000 in 1993. The Company sold $25,071,000 of loans during the third 
quarter of 1994, compared with $123,753,000 in the third quarter of 1993. 
The Company recorded net gains of $356,000 on the sale of these loans in the 
third quarter of 1994, compared to net gains of $987,000 for the third 
quarter of 1993. For the first nine months, loan sales were $216,262,000 in 
1994 and $300,864,000 in 1993; net gains on sale of loans were $482,000 in 
1994 and $2,019,000 in 1993. 

The portfolio of real estate loans serviced for third-party investors 
was $882,024,000 at September 30, 1994, an increase of $67,571,000 since 
December 31, 1993. Net revenues earned on loans serviced were $719,000 for the 
third quarter of 1994, compared to $303,000 for the third quarter of 1993. For
the first nine months, service fees were $1,709,000 in 1994 and $757,000 in
1993.

At September 30, 1994, nonaccruing loans and REO totalled $48,845,000, or
2.98% of assets, including foreclosed REO of $7,295,000. Nonaccruing assets 
included approximately $36,000,000 of loans and REO adversely impacted by the 
earthquake. Accruing single family loans more than 90 days past due totalled 
$3,440,000 at September 30, 1994. Restructured performing loans, as of 
September 30, 1994, totalled $10,538,000, 66% of which have been restructured as
a result of the earthquake. At June 30, 1994, nonaccruing 
<PAGE>
FIRST REPUBLIC BANCORP INC. Page 3

loans and REO totalled $48,394,000. Management of the Company expects that 
the level of loan delinquencies and REO may continue at this level for a while. 

During the third quarter 1994, the Company continued to work with its 
borrowers whose properties have been adversely impacted by the Los Angeles 
earthquake and began to resolve specific situations, including the writedown of 
loans. Within the Company's loan portfolio, loans secured by 37+ unit 
multifamily properties located in Los Angeles are most affected. First Republic
has assisted its borrowers by modifying the terms of loans. The Company has 
also assisted many of its borrowers in the application for federal, state, and 
local disaster relief funds, although the receipt of such funds has been much 
slower than had been anticipated. While some of the Company's borrowers have 
received assistance, the Company expects that other borrowers will ultimately 
receive some assistance and has deferred the modification of certain nonaccruing
loans until the disaster relief process is concluded.

At September 30, 1994, the Company's nonaccrual loan total included 
$19,100,000 of loans which had been restructured by the forgiveness of interest 
or the capitalization of interest equivalent to more than four months. As a 
result of the terms of these restructurings, although the Company has in some 
cases received or expects to receive monthly payments, the loans will 
continue to be reported as nonaccrual loans until at least six payments have 
been received.

During the quarter, the Company added $1,250,000 to its earthquake 
reserve and provided $250,000 to its recession reserve. Writedowns and 
chargeoffs on loans and REO, net of recoveries, were $2,659,000 during the 
quarter, of which $2,405,000, or over 90%, were related to properties adversely 
impacted by the earthquake. At September 30, 1994, total reserves were 
$14,306,000, or 1.00% of loans. Until the full impact of the effects of the 
earthquake on properties securing the Company's loans becomes more clearly 
determined and the disaster relief application process is completed, the 
Company will continue to assess the need for additional reserves.

First Republic Bancorp Inc. functions as a direct lender as well as a 
mortgage banker through two FDIC-insured, California and Nevada-chartered 
industrial bank subsidiaries. First Republic Thrift & Loan provides both loan 
and deposit services from eight locations in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, 
Beverly Hills, and San Diego areas. First Republic Savings Bank provides both 
loan and deposit services from its office located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
