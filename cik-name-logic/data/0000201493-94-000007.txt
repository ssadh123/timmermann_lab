COLTEC POSTPONES SECONDARY OFFERING

NEW YORK, NY, May 23, 1994 -- Coltec Industries Inc (NYSE:COT) announced
today that a proposed secondary offering of 23,211,084 outstanding shares
of its common stock has been postponed.

The shares that were to be offered represent holdings of certain selling
stockholders, including all the shares owned by The Morgan Stanley
Leveraged Equity Fund II, L.P. (MSLEF II). Due to uncertain market
conditions, representatives of MSLEF II informed the Company of the
decision not to proceed with the proposed offering at this time. MSLEF
II's representatives also said that they are considering several
alternatives including recommencing the public offering if market
conditions improve or effecting a distribution of MSLEF II's shares to its
partners.

Coltec Industries, based in New York, is a manufacturing company serving
aerospace, automotive and other industrial markets.
