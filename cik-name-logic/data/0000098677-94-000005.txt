PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The Company acquired the Cambridge Brands Division of Warner-Lambert Company 
on October 15, 1993. The pro forma income statement data for the year ended 
December 31, 1992 and the nine months ended September 30, 1993 presented 
below have been prepared assuming the Company consummated the acquisition
of Cambridge Brands at the beginning of the period presented and reflect 
estimated purchase accounting and other adjustments related to the 
acquisition. The pro forma balance sheet data as of September 30, 1993 
assumes the Company consummated the acquisition of Cambridge Brands on
September 30, 1993. The pro forma income statement and balance sheet data 
presented below is unaudited. The pro forma income statement data are not 
necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations would have 
been had the transactions occurred at the beginning of the period
presented, nor do they purport to indicate the results of future operations. 
All amounts are in thousands except per share data.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(a) Pro forma adjustment to the cost of goods sold arises from
the determination of depreciation expense (as if the
acquisition had been consummated as of the beginning of the
period for which the pro forma financial statement is
presented) using the Company's methods, useful lives and
basis in the acquired building and machinery and equipment
as opposed to those of the seller.

(b) Pro forma adjustment to general and administrative expense
arises from the amortization of the excess of purchase price
over the net tangible assets acquired (as if the acquisition
had been consummated as of the beginning of the period for
which the pro forma financial statement is presented) using
the Company's method, amortization period and basis in the
acquired net assets as opposed to the method, amortization
period and basis of the seller.

(c) Pro forma adjustment to other income, net arises from the
estimation of interest expense on the acquisition debt and a
reduction of interest income for that portion of the
purchase price which was paid with funds of the Company (as
if the acquisition had been consummated as of the beginning
of the period for which the pro forma financial statement is
presented) using and estimated composite borrowing/investment
return rate.

(d) Pro forma adjustment to provision for income taxes arises from
the determination of tax expense for the consolidated entity
taken as a whole (as if the acquisition had been consummated
as of the beginning of the period for which the pro forma
financial statement is presented).

(e) Pro forma adjustments to cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, net, prepaid expenses and accounts payable arise
due to the fact that the Company did not purchase these assets
and liabilities from the seller and accordingly they are
excluded form the pro forma financial statement.

(f) Pro forma adjustment to investments arises from the payment of
a portion of the purchase price with funds of the Company.

<PAGE> 9

(g) Pro forma adjustment to finished goods and work in progress
arises from the Company's estimate of net realizable value of
the purchased inventory net of estimated costs of disposal and
a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.

(h) Pro forma adjustments to land, buildings, machinery and
equipment and accumulated depreciation arise from the
Company's estimate of replacement cost for assets with similar
capacity.

(i) Pro forma adjustment to excess of cost over acquired net
tangible assets arises from the Company's recording of the
intangible assets to be recognized based upon the purchase
price and the Company's basis in the net assets acquired. 

(j) Pro forma adjustment to bank loans arises from the Company's
issuance of short term notes payable for a portion of the
purchase price.

(k) Pro forma adjustment to accrued liabilities arises from the
Company's recording of liabilities assumed in the purchase as
well as other accrued expenses related to the acquisition.

(l) Pro forma adjustment to deferred taxes arises from the income
tax effect of the differences between the Company's financial
accounting and income tax bases in the net assets acquired.

(m) Pro forma adjustment to divisional equity represents the
elimination of the predecessor's net investment in the
acquisition.
