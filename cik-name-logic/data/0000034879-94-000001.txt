- ----------------------------------------------------------

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To SPX Corporation: 

We have audited the accompanying combined statement of assets and liabilities
of the Sealed Power Corporation and Sealed Power of Canada Ltd. (the
"Business"), as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the related combined
statements of revenue and expenses and changes in equity and cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 1992. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Business' management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

These statements have been prepared for the purpose of complying with the
rules and regulations for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale described in Note 1, between
SPX Corporation and Federal-Mogul Corporation dated as of September 15, 1993,
and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Business' assets,
liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the combined assets and liabilities of the 
Business as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the revenues and expenses and
changes in equity and their cash flows for each of the two years in the 
period ended December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 4 to the combined financial statements, effective
January 1, 1992, the Business changed its method of accounting for post
retirement benefits other than pensions.

SEALED POWER CORPORATION AND
SEALED POWER CORPORATION OF CANADA, LTD.
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1992

(1) BASIS OF COMBINATION AND SUBSEQUENT SALE

The combined financial statements include the accounts of Sealed Power
Corporation, a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of SPX Corporation ("SPX") and
Sealed Power Corporation of Canada, Ltd., a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary
of SPX, and are stated on the basis of historical cost. These combined 
statements have been prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for inclusion in
a Form 8-K filing.

These operations, herein together referred to as the "business", represent 
SPX's operations that market and distribute replacement engine and under 
vehicle parts in the United States and Canada. Operating results as 
presented do not include any costs associated with financing of these 
operations nor charges for certain administrative and management functions 
provided centrally by SPX. As such, these statements may not necessarily 
reflect the combined income that would have resulted if the business had
been conducted on an independent basis.

On October 25, 1993, SPX sold the business to Federal-Mogul Corporation
as of the close of business on October 22, 1993.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and financial policies which affect significant elements of
the combined financial statements of the business and which are not apparent
on the face of the statements, or in other notes to the combined financial
statements, are described below.

A. Principles of Combination

The combined financial statements include the accounts of the business after
the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions 
between Sealed Power Corporation and Sealed Power Corporation of Canada, Ltd.

Assets and liabilities of the business' Canadian operations are translated 
into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange, while revenues and
expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the year. 
Adjustments from translating Canadian operations financial statements are
excluded from the Combined Statement of Revenues and Expenses and are
reported as a component of Equity.

B. Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Domestic
inventories, amounting to $47,942,000 and $50,988,000 at December 31, 1992
and 1991, respectively, are based on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
Such inventories, if priced on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, would
have been approximately $22,784,000 and $23,809,000 greater at December 31,
1992 and 1991, respectively. During 1992 and 1991, certain inventory
quantities were reduced resulting in liquidations of LIFO inventory 
quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect was
to increase net income by $1,423,000 in 1992 and by $122,000 in 1991. 
Canadian inventories are based on FIFO costs.

</TABLE>

C. Property, Plant, & Equipment

The business uses principally the straight-line method for computing
depreciation expense over the useful lives of the property, plant, and
equipment.

Asset additions and improvements are added to the property accounts while 
maintenance and repairs, which do not renew or extend the lives of the 
respective assets, are expensed currently. Upon sale or retirement of 
depreciable properties, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the property accounts. The net gain or loss on disposition of
property is reflected in income.

</TABLE>

D. Costs in Excess of Net Assets of Businesses Acquired

The business amortizes costs in excess of the net assets of businesses
acquired on a straight-line method over the estimated periods benefitted,
not to exceed 40 years. Such amortization was $228,000 in 1992 and 1991.
At December 31, 1992, total costs in excess of net assets of businesses 
acquired was $2,628,000 and accumulated amortization of costs in excess
of net assets of businesses acquired was $1,034,000. 

(3) INCOME TAXES

The results of operations of Sealed Power Corporation is reported for 
Federal income tax purposes in the consolidated U.S. income tax returns of 
SPX. The results of operations of Sealed Power Canada, Ltd. are reported in
individual income tax returns in Canada.

SPX does not have a formal tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries. 
Domestic subsidiaries are charged an amount equal to the applicable Federal
and state statutory tax rates on pretax book income. All domestic prepaid, 
deferred and payable tax balances are maintained by SPX. The difference 
between the effect of statutory rates and the domestic provision (benefit) 
computed on a separate company basis is borne by SPX.

SEALED POWER CORPORATION AND

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 1992

In 1992, SPX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 109 - "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under SFAS No. 109, deferred 
tax balances are stated at tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes 
are actually paid or recovered. SPX's cumulative effect of adopting SFAS
No. 109 in 1992 was a $5 million aftertax benefit. SPX's 1991 financial 
statements have not been restated to reflect the new accounting method
for income taxes. No benefit from adoption was allocated by SPX to the
business.

distribution centers and field warehouses are covered under separated
pension plans. The other nonexempt salary employees and all management
employees participate in the SPX Corporation Pension Plan No. 3. Pension

======== ========
</TABLE>

The amount of pension cost (benefit) charged to the business for U.S.
employees covered under these plans was $(240,000) in 1992 and $(136,000) in
1991. These amounts were allocated to the business based upon estimated 
percentages of relative compensation. There were no assets or liabilities 
of the SPX Corporation Pension Plan No. 3 allocated to the business as of
December 31, 1992 and 1991.

The Canadian employees are also covered under a pension plan. The business
converted its Defined Benefit Pension Plan to a Defined Contribution Plan 
("the Plan") effective December 31, 1990. The Plans provide pension benefits
that are primarily based on the employee's years of service. Current pension
costs are expensed as funded. Upon conversion of the Plan, an unfunded 
liability existed for $300,000. This unfunded liability will be funded by
the business over a period of 15 years. The business has provided $64,000
and $0 in 1992 and 1991, respectively, towards this liability.

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance

Effective January 1, 1992, SPX implemented Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106 - "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions", using the immediate recognition transition option.

SFAS No. 106 requires recognition, during the employees' service with the 
business, of the cost of their retiree health and life insurance benefits. 
At January 1, 1992, SPX's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 
$16.8 million and was recorded as a pretax transition obligation. SPX's 
decrease in net earnings and equity was $10.7 million aftertax. Aside from 
the one-time effect of the adjustment, adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in 
an incremental $600,000 expense for SPX in 1992. SPX's recorded liability 
for postretirement health and life benefits was $18.5 million as of 
December 31, 1992.

<PAGE> 10

SEALED POWER CORPORATION AND
SEALED POWER CORPORATION OF CANADA, LTD.
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 1992

Prior to 1992, SPX recognized postretirement health care and life insurance 
benefits as expense when claims or premiums were paid. These costs totaled
approximately $958,000 in 1991. The following summarizes the 1992 expense 
for postretirement health and life insurance recognized by SPX 
(in thousands):

Recognition of transition obligation $16,829
Benefit cost for service during the year - net of
employee contributions 315
Interest cost on accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligation 1,306
-------
Postretirement benefit cost $18,450
=======

The actuarial assumptions used to determine 1992 costs and benefit 
obligation includes a discount rate of 8.25% and an assumed rate of future
increase in per capita cost of health care benefits (health care trend 
rates) of 13% in 1992, decreasing gradually to 6% by the year 2002. 
Increasing the health care trend rate by one percentage point would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $1.3 million and would
increase the 1992 postretirement benefit cost by $.1 million.

The liability for and amount of postretirement health and life insurance 
costs charged to the business in 1992 was as follows (in thousands):

Recognition of transition obligation $ 4,912
Benefit cost for service during the year - net of
employee contributions 124
Interest cost on accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligation 442
-------
Postretirement benefit cost $ 5,478
=======

These amounts were allocated to the business based upon estimated 
percentages of relative active and retired employees covered under the
benefit plans.

Other

Employees of the U.S. business participate in SPX's Employee Stock Ownership
Plan. The business expensed $831,000 in 1992 and $644,000 in 1991 for costs
of the plan. Payment for this benefit is made to SPX Corporation in the 
first quarter of the year subsequent to when the costs were incurred. 
Accordingly, the business had a liability recorded for this benefit of 
$831,000 and $644,000 as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The business provides a Retirement Savings Plan for eligible employees. 
Employees can contribute up to 15% of their earnings with the business
matching a portion of the amount up to 6% of their earnings. The 
business's contribution to this plan was $137,000 in 1992 and $98,000 in
1991.

Certain management employees of the business participate in SPX's Stock
Compensation Plan. This plan did not result in an expense to the business
in 1992 and 1991.

<PAGE> 11

SEALED POWER CORPORATION AND
SEALED POWER CORPORATION OF CANADA, LTD.
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 1992

By 1994, the business must adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,
No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". The business'
preliminary assessment of this statement indicates that it should not have a
significant impact on the financial position or expenses of the business.

(5) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The business leases certain offices, warehouses and equipment under
lease agreements which expire at various dates through 2009.

Major leased assets, which have been capitalized, include a distribution
center in both 1992 and 1991 and a computer in 1991. The assets included
in property, plant, and equipment relating to these leases were $4,000,000
and $5,400,000 as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively and the 
related accumulated depreciation was $700,000 and $500,000 as of
December 31, 1992 and 1991.

Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under the capital 
lease and noncancellable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of
one year or more consisted of the following at December 31, 1992:

Capital Operating

Amounts representing interest (5,123)
------
Present value of future minimum lease
payments $3,798
Less amounts due in one year 75
------
Long-term capital lease obligation $3,723
======

Rentals on operating leases were approximately $2.9 million in 1992 and 
$2.4 million in 1991.

Certain claims, including suits and complaints arising in the ordinary 
course of business, have been filed or are pending against the business. 
In the opinion of management, all such matters are without merit or are of
such kind, or involve such amounts, as would not have a significant effect 
on the financial position or results of operations of the business if
disposed of unfavorably. Additionally, the business has insurance to
minimize its exposures of this nature.

Since April of 1991, SPX has participated in a three year agreement with a
financial institution whereby the business agreed to sell undivided 
fractional interests in designated pools of domestic trade accounts 
receivable, in an amount not to exceed $30 million. In order to maintain 
the balance in the designated pools of trade accounts receivable sold, the

<PAGE> 12

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
DECEMBER 31, 1992

business sells participating interests in new receivables as existing 
receivables are collected. At December 31, 1992 and 1991, the business had 
sold $16.5 million and $25.5 million of trade accounts receivable under this
program. Under the terms of this agreement, the business is obligated to pay
fees which approximate the purchasers' cost of issuing a like amount in 
commercial paper plus certain administrative costs. The amount of such fees
in 1992 and 1991 were $1,275,000 and $744,000 respectively. These fees are
included in other (income) expense, net.

Interim Statements

The combined financial statements include the accounts of Sealed Power 
Corporation, a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of SPX Corporation ("SPX") and 
Sealed Power Corporation of Canada, Ltd., a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary
of SPX, herein together referred to as SPR.

The unaudited combined condensed financial statements are based in part on
approximations and are subject to adjustments that may develop in connection
with an audit of the financial statements; however, in the opinion of 
management, all adjustments (which consist of normal recurring accruals) 
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the 
periods presented have been included except that the operating results as 
presented do not include any costs associated with financing of its 
operations nor charges for certain administrative and management functions
provided centrally by SPX. Results of operations for any interim period are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance

Effective January 1, 1992, SPX implemented Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106 -- "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions," using the immediate recognition transition
option. The cumulative effect allocated to SPR of $3.2 million was based on
estimated percentages of relative active and retired employees covered under
the benefit plans. Further disclosure is provided in the Postretirement
Health Care and Life Insurance Footnote to the December 31, 1992 and 1991 
combined Financial Statements for SPR.

Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of earnings
for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 reflects the
acquisition of Sealed Power Corporation and Sealed Power
Corporation of Canada, Ltd. (SPR) by Federal-Mogul Corporation
(Federal-Mogul) as if it had occurred at the beginning of the
period presented. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet at September 30, 1993 reflects the SPR acquisition as
if it occurred on that date.

There are three pro forma combined condensed statements of earnings
for the year ended December 31, 1992 presented herein. The first
reflects the acquisition of both SPR and the automotive aftermarket
business acquired from TRW (AAB) on October 20, 1992 as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the period presented. Additionally,
separate pro forma combined condensed statements of earnings for
the year ended December 31, 1992 are presented; one with the pro
forma earnings results of Federal-Mogul and SPR; and one with the
pro forma earnings results of Federal-Mogul and AAB, in each case
as if the acquisitions had occurred January 1, 1992.

Notes to Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note A-Pro Forma Financial Statements

The pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 1992 is based on 
historical financial statements of Federal-Mogul and SPR after giving effect
to the transactions and the adjustments described in Note B. The pro forma
information as of September 30, 1993 and for the nine months then ended is
based on unaudited financial statements of Federal-Mogul and SPR. The pro
forma information for AAB for the year ended December 31, 1992 is based on
unaudited financial statements of AAB. The unaudited financial statements
include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which 
Federal-Mogul, SPR and AAB consider necessary for a fair presentation of 
the financial position and results of operations for this period, except 
that the operating results of SPR as presented do not include any costs
associated with financing of its operations nor charges for certain 
administrative and management functions provided centrally by SPX 
Corporation.

The pro forma financial statements may not be indicative of the results that
actually would have occurred if the transactions had occurred on the dates 
assumed and do not project Federal-Mogul's financial position or results of
operations at any future date or period then ended. The pro forma financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and 
related notes of SPR contained elsewhere herein and the financial statements
and related notes of AAB included in Federal-Mogul's Form 8 dated 
January 4, 1993, filed as Amendment No. 1 to its Form 8-K dated 
October 20, 1992.

Note B-Pro Forma Adjustments

The accompanying pro forma combined condensed financial statements
include adjustments to increase (decrease) pro forma combined earnings
before taxes or increase (decrease) pro forma combined shareholders' 
equity, as follows (in millions): 

A) Elimination of intercompany sales and purchases between
Federal-Mogul and SPR.

B) Estimated savings of $22 million per year and $17 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 1993 from rationalization of 
combined Federal-Mogul and SPR business operations. The pro forma
statements of earnings do not reflect a pre tax charge of 
approximately $1 million for nonrecurring rationalization costs
related to Federal-Mogul facilities expected to be expensed by 
Federal-Mogul upon completion of the acquisition.

C) Interest at 4 3/8% (1% over the current three-month London 
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) of 3 3/8%) on the $143 million draw 
on the revolving credit agreement, made to finance the acquisition.

<PAGE> 26

Notes to Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note B-Pro Forma Adjustments - Continued

D) Amortization of intangible assets acquired of $81 million over 
periods ranging from 4 to 40 years.

E) Estimated income tax effect of pro forma adjustments.

F) Net cash effect of the following pro forma adjustments 
(in millions):

Proceeds of debt $ 143 
Payment of financing costs (1)
Payment of purchase price (143)
Payment of professional fees (2)
-----
$ (3)
=====

G) Elimination of excluded assets, liabilities and net investment 
from historical SPR combined statements. Accounts receivable 
reflects a net addition as Federal-Mogul purchased receivables that
SPR had previously reflected as sold.

H) Net effect of changing SPR's inventory costing method from last in,
first out (LIFO) to fair value at date of acquisition.

I) Fair value adjustment of $5 million to acquired property, plant
and equipment, primarily relating to abandoned assets.

J) Intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of
$81 million.

K) Accrual of rationalization costs of $25 million of SPR related 
costs capitalized as part of the acquisition and $1 million of 
Federal-Mogul related rationalization costs expected to be expensed
after the acquisition.

L) Proceeds from the draw on the revolving credit agreement.

M) Elimination of intercompany sales and purchases between AAB and SPR.

N) Elimination of intercompany sales and purchases between 
Federal-Mogul and AAB.

O) Effect of changing AAB's inventory costing method from last-in, 
first-out (LIFO) to fair value at date of acquisition.

P) Reclassification of AAB costs and expenses to conform with 
Federal-Mogul classifications.

<PAGE> 27

Notes to Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Note B-Pro Forma Adjustments - Continued

Q) Estimated savings from rationalization of combined Federal-Mogul
and AAB business operations. 

R) Additional depreciation to reflect the fair market value of 
acquired property, plant and equipment.

S) Additional interest at 6.25% on $125 million of long-term debt 
obtained to partially finance the acquisition.

T) Elimination of AAB interest expense on debt not assumed in the
acquisition.

U) Amortization of intangible assets acquired of $72 million over
periods ranging from 6 to 40 years.

V) Estimated income tax effect of pro forma adjustments.

W) Dividends at 7.75% on convertible exchangeable stock issued to
partially finance the acquisition of AAB.

Note C-Other Matters

The pro forma statements of earnings do not reflect a pretax charge of 
approximately $1 million for nonrecurring rationalization costs related 
to Federal-Mogul facilities expected to be expensed by Federal-Mogul upon
completion of the acquisition of SPR.
