NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect all
adjustments which management believes necessary (which include only normal
recurring accruals and the effect on LIFO inventory valuation of estimated
annual inflationary cost increases and year-end inventory levels) to present
fairly the results of operations. These statements, however, do not include
all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of
financial position, results of operations and cash flow in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

The Division's business is subject to seasonal influences, and interim results
may not necessarily be indicative of the results which may be expected for any
other interim period or for the year as a whole.

For further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes
for the Cloth World Division of Brown Group, Inc. for the period ended 
January 29, 1994 included herein.

NOTE B - INVENTORIES

All inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method had
been used, inventories would have been $9,562,000 higher at July 30, 1994.

NOTE C - SALE OF CLOTH WORLD

On August 25, 1994, Brown Group, Inc., announced an agreement to sell
substantially all of the assets, net of certain liabilities to be assumed, of
its Cloth World Division to Fabri-Centers of America, Inc. The transaction
was completed on October 2, 1994.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Brown Group, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the Cloth World Division of
Brown Group, Inc. as of January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, and the related
statements of income and net investment in division, and cash flows for the
years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Division's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Cloth World Division of
Brown Group, Inc. at January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements include the accounts of the Cloth World Division (the
Division) of Brown Group, Inc. The Division is a 342-store chain of retail
stores featuring quality apparel fabrics, home decorating, soft crafts, and
sewing supplies at competitive prices.

On August 25, 1994, Brown Group, Inc., announced an agreement to sell
substantially all of the assets, net of certain liabilities to be assumed, of
its Cloth World Division to Fabri-Centers of America, Inc. The transaction was
completed on October 2, 1994.

ACCOUNTING PERIOD

The Division's fiscal year is the 52 or 53 week period ending the Saturday
nearest to January 31. Fiscal years 1993 and 1992 ended on January 29, 1994
and January 30, 1993, respectively. Fiscal years 1993 and 1992 each included
52 weeks.

INVENTORIES

All inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method had
been used, inventories would have been $9,184,000 and $10,135,000 higher at
January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, respectively.

FIXED ASSETS

Fixed assets are stated at cost and consist primarily of leasehold improvements
and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are provided over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the remaining term of leases where
applicable, using the straight-line method.

INCOME TAXES

Provision is made for the tax effects of timing differences between financial
and tax reporting. These differences relate principally to depreciation and
inventory.

PREOPENING AND CLOSING EXPENSES

Preopening expenses of new facilities are charged to operations when incurred.
Costs of closing facilities, including capital asset disposition losses, and
lease termination costs, are accrued when management makes the decision to
close such facilities.

F-9

PAGE 13 OF 126
<PAGE> 14

NOTE 2: TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Due from affiliates consists of a noninterest-bearing receivable from Brown
Group, Inc., and represents the net accumulated balance resulting from various
transactions between the Division and Brown Group, Inc. The balance is
primarily the result of the Division's participation in a central cash
management program, under which all cash receipts are remitted to Brown Group,
Inc., and all cash disbursements are funded by Brown Group, Inc. In addition,
it reflects certain costs charged to the Division for which no cash is
transferred. These costs include income tax payments, employee benefits,
insurance, and administrative services.

Brown Group, Inc., charges the Division for various insurance and employee
benefit programs sponsored by Brown Group, Inc. in which the Division and its
employees participate. These charges totaled $6,845,153 and $5,845,313 in 1993
and 1992, respectively. The benefit plans include health and life insurance,
pension, savings, and postretirement and postemployment; see Note 3 for a
description of some of these plans. Insurance programs include casualty,
workers' compensation, property, and umbrella coverage.

Additionally, Brown Group, Inc., provides the Division with various
administrative services, for which the Division is charged associated costs
based upon approximate usage of these services. The administrative services
provided include payroll and tax accounting, risk management, distribution,
employee benefit management, administrative offices facility management, and
certain computer services. Charges for these services totaled $1,944,725 and
$2,084,460 in 1993 and 1992, respectively. Such charges may not be
representative of administrative expenses that would be incurred if the
Division operated as a stand-alone company.

Included in fixed assets is an allocated portion of Brown Group, Inc.'s office
building, in which the Division's administrative offices are located. The net
amount allocated to the Division is based upon square footage occupied and was
$1,116,000 in 1993 and $1,173,000 in 1992, the related expenses for which are
included in the administrative services charge above.

NOTE 3: RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

PENSIONS

Substantially all full-time employees of the Division are covered under several
noncontributory pension plans sponsored by Brown Group, Inc. Plans covering
salaried and management employees provide pension benefits that are based on
the employee's highest consecutive five years of compensation during the ten
years before retirement. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide
benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. Brown Group, Inc.'s
funding policy for all plans is to make the minimum annual contributions
required by applicable regulations.

The following table sets forth Brown Group, Inc.'s plans' funded status at the
December 31, 1993 and 1992 measurement dates, and amounts recognized in Brown
Group, Inc.'s Balance Sheet at January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, as this
information is not practical to accumulate for the Division alone (in
thousands):

</TABLE>

Pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed stocks and bonds. The
plan assets are valued using the current market value for bonds and a five-year
moving average for equities.

Prior service costs are amortized over the average remaining service period of
employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.

The Division realized pension income of $48,000 in 1993 and $90,000 in 1992.
No pension asset has been recognized in the balance sheet of the Division.

SAVINGS PLAN

All management and full-time office employees of the Division are eligible to
participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan sponsored by Brown Group,
Inc. The plan covers salaried, management, and certain hourly employees who
have one year of service and who

F-11

PAGE 15 OF 126
<PAGE> 16

are 21 years of age. Division contributions represent a partial matching of
employee contributions generally up to a maximum of 3.5% of the employee's
salary. The Division's expense for this plan was $264,000 in 1993 and $257,000
in 1992.

NOTE 4: INCOME TAXES
- - --------------------

INCOME TAXES

The Division is included in Brown Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax
return for all periods presented. Income taxes are accounted for under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which Brown Group, Inc., adopted in fiscal 1991.
SFAS No. 109 requires the adjustment of previously deferred taxes for changes
in tax rates under the liability method. The accompanying financial statements
reflect income tax expense based on a tax sharing arrangement between the
companies. Under the arrangement, the income tax provision reflects the
financial consequences of all income, deductions, and credits which can be
utilized on a separate return basis or in consolidation with Brown Group, Inc.,
and which are assured of realization.

The components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows (in thousands):

INTRODUCTION TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

On October 2, 1994, the Company acquired substantially all of
the assets of Cloth World, a division of Brown Group Inc. ("Cloth World") for
approximately $100 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. 
The final purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments. The funds
used to acquire Cloth World were provided by internally generated funds and
borrowings under the credit facility. The acquisition has been recorded using
the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations of Cloth World
have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the
date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation has been based on
preliminary estimates which may be revised at a later date; however, the effect
of any revisions on the results of operations would not be material.

The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet as of July 30,
1994 gives effect to material events that are directly attributable to the
acquisition as if it had occurred on July 30, 1994. The unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Statements of Income for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 1994 and
the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994 give effect to material events that are
directly attributable to the acquisition as if it had occurred on January 31,
1993.

The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for
informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results that would have occurred had the Cloth World acquisition been
consummated at the beginning of the periods presented. In addition, they are
not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect synergies
that might be achieved from combined operations.

18

PAGE 51 OF 126
<PAGE> 28

effect from time to time. Within the limits set forth herein, the Borrower may

amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made by each Bank and all prepayments
thereof and the applicable dates with respect thereto shall be recorded by such
Bank from time to time on any ledger or other record of such Bank or such Bank
shall record such information by such other method as such Bank may generally

such Revolving Credit Note.

(d) NOTICE OF BORROWING. The obligation of each Bank to make

of a proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Prime Rate Loans, (ii) on
a day which is three (3) Banking Days prior to the Banking Day which is the

Banking Day which is the requested date of a proposed Revolving Credit

PAGE 52 OF 126
<PAGE> 29

Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of LIBOR Loans or Fed Funds Rate Loans,

give a Notice of Borrowing telephonically so long as written confirmation of
such Revolving Credit Borrowing by delivery of written Notice of Borrowing is
received by the Agent by 1:00 p.m. (Cleveland, Ohio time) on the same day such
telephonic Notice of Borrowing was given. The Agent may rely on such
telephonic Notice of Borrowing to the same extent that the Agent may rely on a
written Notice of Borrowing. Each Notice of Borrowing and telephonic Notice of
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and subject to the
indemnification provisions of this Article 3. The Borrower shall bear all
risks related to the giving of a Notice of Borrowing telephonic or by such
other method of transmission as the Borrower shall elect. The Agent shall give
to each Bank reasonably prompt notice by telecopier on the day received of each
such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing.

(e) BANKS TO FUND AGENT. Each Bank shall, before 2:00 P.M.

available to the Agent, in immediately available funds at the account of the
Agent maintained at the Payment Office as specified by the Agent to the Banks
prior to such date, such Bank's Ratable Portion of the Revolving Credit Loans
comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing. On the date requested by the
Borrower for a Revolving Credit Borrowing, after the Agent's receipt of the
funds representing a Bank's Ratable Portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing
and upon the Borrower's fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article 3, the Agent will make the funds of such Bank available to the Borrower
at the aforesaid applicable Payment Office.

(f) AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. Unless the Agent shall have received
notice from a Bank prior to the date, except in the case of Prime Rate Loans in
which case prior to the time, of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Bank
will not make available to the Agent such Bank's Ratable Portion of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made its
Ratable Portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowing available to the Agent on the
date of the Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 3.1(e). In
reliance upon such assumption, the Agent may, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding portion of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have
made available to the Agent its Ratable Portion of the Loan to be made as to
the Revolving Credit Borrowing, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to
repay to the Agent, immediately upon demand, the corresponding portion of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing, together with interest thereon, for each day from
the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent (i) in the case of the Borrower, at the interest
rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Credit Loans comprising such
Revolving Credit Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, at the Fed Funds
Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding portion of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing, the amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's
Ratable Portion as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.

(g) FAILURE OF BANK TO LOAN. The failure of any Bank to make the
Loan to be made by it as its Ratable Portion of any Revolving Credit Borrowing
shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to make its Loan
on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.

20

PAGE 53 OF 126
<PAGE> 30

No Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan
to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing.

right, upon request delivered by the Borrower to the Agent not later than 12:00

Period of the same duration so as to comprise a Revolving Credit Borrowing, (v)
on the day which is three (3) Banking Days prior to the Banking Day upon which

Banking Day upon which the Borrower desires to convert any Fed Funds Rate Loans
having a particular Interest Period comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing
into Fed Funds Rate Loans having a different permissible Interest Period so as

Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation shall be subject to the following:

(A) each Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation shall be
funded among the Banks based upon each Bank's Ratable Portion of such
converted or continued Revolving Credit Loans comprising a Revolving
Credit Borrowing;

continued, as the case may be, and the accrued interest on any such

(G) in connection with any Rate Conversion or Rate
Continuation, no Interest Period can be selected which ends after the
date of any reduction in the Maximum Availability Amount unless, after
giving effect to such selection, the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of any then outstanding Prime Rate Loans taken together with the
principal amount of any then outstanding LIBOR Loans or Fed Funds Rate
Loans having Interest Periods ending on or prior to the date of such
reduction shall be at least equal to the principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans due and payable on or prior to such date.

Each such request for a conversion or continuation (a "Rate

Participation Exposure. The Borrower shall not be permitted to reduce the Total
Commitment Amount unless, concurrently with any reduction, the Borrower shall
make a principal payment on each Bank's then outstanding Revolving Credit Loans
in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of such Revolving Credit Loans PLUS
the aggregate Risk Participation Exposure over the Commitment of such Bank as
so reduced. The Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of its proportionate
amount and the date of each such reduction. From and after each such
reduction, the Unused Commitment Fees and Facility Fees payable hereunder shall
be calculated upon the Commitments of the Banks as so reduced. Each reduction
of the aggregate Commitments shall be made among the Banks in accordance with
its Ratable Portion. Any partial reduction in the Total Commitment Amount shall
be irrevocable and effective during the remainder of the Commitment Period and
shall not have the effect of reducing the Maximum Availability Amount from time
to time except to the extent that the Total Commitment Amount as so reduced is
less than the Maximum Availability Amount. Any partial reduction of the Total
Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall not alter the
obligation of the Borrower to prepay any amounts in excess of the Maximum
Availability Amount pursuant to Section 3.2(c) hereof. If the Borrower
terminates in whole the Commitments of the Banks, on the effective date of such
termination (the Borrower having prepaid in full the unpaid principal balance,
if any, of the Notes outstanding together with all interest (if any) and Unused
Commitment Fees and Facility Fees accrued and unpaid and all other amounts due
to the Agent or the Banks hereunder) all of the Notes outstanding shall be
delivered to the Agent marked "Cancelled" and redelivered to the Borrower.

(b) MANDATORY REDUCTION. In the event that the Acquisition shall
not have been consummated on or before November 1, 1994, the Total Commitment
Amount shall be automatically reduced to One Hundred Seventy-Five Million
Dollars ($175,000,000). Each reduction of the Total Commitment Amount shall be
made among the Banks each in accordance with its Ratable Portion. In the event
that such reduction of the Total Commitment Amount results in the aggregate
outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans PLUS the aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure exceeding the Total Commitment Amount as so reduced, the
Borrower shall on such day prepay an aggregate principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans in an amount at least equal to such excess, together
with accrued interest to the date of such reduction on the principal amount
paid pursuant hereto, to the Agent for application to the Banks each in
accordance with its Ratable Portion. Any such reduction in the Total
Commitment Amount shall be effective during the remainder of the Commitment
Period and shall not have the effect of reducing the Maximum Availability
Amount from time to time except to the extent that the Total Commitment Amount
as so reduced is less than the Maximum Availability Amount. Any reduction of
the Total Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall not alter the
obligation of the Borrower to prepay any amounts in excess of the Maximum
Availability Amount pursuant to Section 3.2(a) hereof.

(c) EXTENSION OF COMMITMENT PERIOD. After the Borrower shall have
furnished its annual audit report pursuant to Section 8.1(b) hereof, commencing
with such financial statements for the 1995 Fiscal Year, the Borrower may
request in writing that the Commitment Period be extended one (1) year to the
Anniversary Date next following the last day of the Commitment Period then in
effect, which request shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4 hereto
(an "Extension Request and Consent") addressed to the Agent on behalf of the
Banks. The Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of each such Extension Request
and Consent to each of the Banks. The Banks agree to give consideration to
each such request and to respond in writing to the Borrower affirmatively or
negatively as to such request no later than sixty (60) days after such request
is received by the Agent. No Bank shall be obligated to grant the Borrower any
such extension, and unanimous written consent of all the Banks shall be
required to extend the Commitment Period. In the event of the failure of any
of the Banks to so respond affirmatively or negatively in writing within such
sixty (60) day period, such request for extension shall be deemed to have been
denied.

SECTION 3.3 REPAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS; PREPAYMENT COMPENSATION.

(a) REPAYMENT. The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for account of
the Banks the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and
the accrued and unpaid interest, Facility Fees and Unused Commitment Fees and
any other amounts owing to the Banks, or any thereof, under this Agreement on
the last day of the Commitment Period or upon acceleration pursuant to Section
11.1 or 11.2.

(b) PERMITTED PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower may prepay, not later than
12:00 noon (Cleveland, Ohio time), upon at least two (2) Banking Days' notice
to the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the
prepayment, and, upon such notice, shall prepay the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising

24

PAGE 57 OF 126
<PAGE> 34

part of the same Revolving Credit Borrowing in whole or ratably in part,
together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal
amount prepaid; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each partial prepayment of Revolving
Credit Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) or additional increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or
any integral multiple thereof. Any prepayment of any LIBOR Loans or Fed Funds
Rate Loans made on other than the last day of an Interest Period shall obligate
the Borrower to reimburse the Banks in respect thereof pursuant to Sections
3.3(d) or (e) hereof, respectively. Upon receipt by the Agent of a notice
pursuant to this Section 3.3(b), the Agent shall promptly forward a copy of
such notice, by telecopier in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans or Fed
Funds Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing, to each of the Banks.

(c) MANDATORY PREPAYMENT. If on any Banking Day the aggregate
outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans PLUS the aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure exceeds the Maximum Availability Amount then in effect,
the Borrower shall on such day prepay an aggregate principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans in an amount at least equal to such excess, together
with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount
prepaid, to the Agent for the account of each of the Banks ratably in
accordance with their Commitments.

(d) PREPAYMENT COMPENSATION; LIBOR LOANS. In any case of
prepayment of any LIBOR Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing, the
Borrower agrees that if Adjusted LIBOR as determined as of 11:00 a.m. London
time, two (2) Banking Days prior to the date of prepayment of any LIBOR Loans
comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing (hereinafter, "Prepayment LIBOR") shall
be lower than the last Adjusted LIBOR previously determined for those LIBOR
Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing with respect to which prepayment
is intended to be made (hereinafter, "Last LIBOR"), then the Borrower shall,
upon written notice by the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent, for the account of
each of the Banks, in immediately available funds, compensation for such
prepayment measured by a rate (the "LIBOR Prepayment Compensation Rate") which
shall be equal to the difference between the Last LIBOR and the Prepayment
LIBOR. In determining the Prepayment LIBOR, the Agent shall apply a rate equal
to Adjusted LIBOR for a deposit approximately equal to the amount of such
prepayment which would be applicable to an Interest Period commencing on the
date of such prepayment and having a duration as nearly equal as practicable to
the remaining duration of the actual Interest Period during which such
prepayment is to be made. The LIBOR Prepayment Compensation Rate shall be
applied to all or such part of the principal amounts of the Notes as related to
the LIBOR Loans to be prepaid, and the prepayment compensation shall be
computed for the period commencing with the date on which such prepayment is to
be made to that date which coincides with the last day of the Interest Period
previously established when the LIBOR Loans, which are to be prepaid, were
made. In the event the Borrower cancels a Notice of Borrowing with respect to
a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of LIBOR Loans subsequent to the
delivery to the Agent of such notice such cancellation shall be treated as a
prepayment as to which the Banks shall be entitled to the aforementioned
prepayment compensation.

(e) PREPAYMENT COMPENSATION RATE; FED FUNDS RATE LOANS. In any
case of prepayment of any Fed Funds Rate Loans comprising all or any part of a
Revolving Credit

25

PAGE 58 OF 126
<PAGE> 35

Borrowing, the Borrower agrees that if the Fed Funds Rate as determined as of
11:00 a.m. Cleveland time, one (1) Banking Day prior to the date of prepayment
of any Fed Funds Rate Loans (hereinafter, "Prepayment Fed Funds Rate") shall be
lower than the last Fed Funds Rate previously determined for those Fed Funds
Rate Loans with respect to which prepayment is intended to be made
(hereinafter, "Last Fed Funds Rate"), then the Borrower shall, upon written
notice by the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent, for the account of each of the
Banks, in immediately available funds, a prepayment penalty measured by a rate
(the "Fed Funds Prepayment Compensation Rate") which shall be equal to the
difference between the Last Fed Funds Rate and the Prepayment Fed Funds Rate.
In determining the Prepayment Fed Funds Rate, the Agent shall apply the Fed
Funds Rate which would be applicable to a Fed Funds Rate Loan approximately
equal to the amount of such prepayment having an Interest Period commencing on
the date of such prepayment and having a duration as nearly equal as
practicable to the remaining duration of the actual Interest Period during
which such prepayment is to be made. The Prepayment Fed Funds Compensation
Rate shall be applied to all or such part of the principal amounts of the
Revolving Credit Notes as related to the Fed Funds Rate Loans to be prepaid,
and the prepayment penalty shall be computed for the period commencing with the
date on which such prepayment is to be made to the date which coincides with
the last day of the Interest Period previously established when the Fed Funds
Loans, which are to be prepaid, were made. In the event the Borrower cancels a
proposed Fed Funds Rate Loan subsequent to the delivery to the Agent of a
Notice of Borrowing with respect a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Fed
Funds Rate Loans, such cancellation shall be treated as a prepayment as to
which the Banks shall be entitled to the aforementioned prepayment
compensation.

SECTION 3.4 FEES.

(a) FACILITY FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to each Bank,
through the Agent on the last day of each Fiscal Quarter commencing with the
Fiscal Quarter ending October 29, 1994, and on the date on which the
Commitments of such Bank shall be terminated or assigned in whole as provided
herein, a facility fee (a "Facility Fee") at a rate per annum, determined on a
daily basis, equal to the Applicable Fee Percentage from time to time in effect
as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(c) below, payable in arrears, on the
amount of the Commitment of such Bank, whether used or unused, determined on a
daily basis, during the preceding calendar quarter (or short period commencing
with the Closing Date, and ending with the last day of the Commitment Period or
any date on which the Commitment of such Bank shall be terminated or assigned
in whole).

(b) UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to each
Bank, through the Agent, on last day of each Fiscal Quarter commencing with the
Fiscal Quarter ending October 29, 1994, and on the date on which the
Commitments of the Banks shall have been terminated or assigned in whole as
provided herein, an unused commitment fee (an "Unused Commitment Fee") at a
rate per annum, determined on a daily basis, equal to the Applicable Fee
Percentage from time to time in effect as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(c)
below, payable in arrears, on the average daily unused portion of the
Commitment of such Bank, determined on a daily basis, during the preceding
calendar quarter (or short period commencing with the Closing Date and ending
with the last day of the Commitment Period or any date on

26

PAGE 59 OF 126
<PAGE> 36

which the Commitment of such Bank shall be terminated or assigned in whole).
For the purposes of calculating Unused Commitment Fees in respect of
Commitments, any portion of such Commitment unavailable due to Revolving Credit
Loans, outstanding Time Drafts in respect of Commercial Letters of Credit,
outstanding Standby Letters of Credit and outstanding Acceptances shall be
deemed to be usage. Any portion of such Commitment unavailable due to
outstanding Sight Drafts under Commercial Letters of Credit shall not be deemed
to be usage for the purposes of computing the Unused Commitment Fee.
Negotiated Bid Loans and Pre-Closing Date Acceptances shall not be deemed to be
usage for the purposes of computing the Unused Commitment Fee.

(c) DETERMINATION OF APPLICABLE FEE PERCENTAGE. So long as no
Event of Default shall exist, the Applicable Fee Percentage shall be adjusted
as herein specified as of the first day of the Fiscal Quarter ("Fee Adjustment
Date") during which (or, in the case of the first Fiscal Quarter of any Fiscal
Year, subsequent to which) the Agent shall have received (A) financial
statements required by Sections 8.1(a) (or, in the case of the case of the
first Fiscal Quarter of any Fiscal Year, by Section 8.1(b)) for the period
ending as of the last day of the Fiscal Quarter (or, in the case of the first
Fiscal Quarter of any Fiscal Year, the Fiscal Year) immediately preceding such
Fee Adjustment Date (each a "Fee Determination Date") and (B) a certificate
complying with Section 8.1(c)(ii) certifying the Borrower's Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any
such Fee Determination Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, subject to the provisions of
the last sentence of this Section 3.4(c), the Applicable Fee Percentage to be
in effect from the Closing Date until the earlier of the delivery of the
Borrower's financial statements for the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year or one
hundred twenty days (120) after the last day of the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal
Year, shall be .225%; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, with respect to any increase or
decrease in the Unused Commitment Fee and Facility Fee for the first Fiscal
Quarter of each Fiscal Year, such increase or decrease, as the case may be
shall be paid by an adjustment to the Unused Commitment Fee or Facility Fee, as
the case may be, payable for the second Fiscal Quarter of such Fiscal Year. As
of any such Fee Adjustment Date, the Applicable Fee Percentage shall be the
Applicable Fee Percentage indicated in the definition of the term "Applicable
Fee Percentage" corresponding to the Borrower's Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any such
Fee Determination Date. Any such adjustment of the Applicable Fee Percentage
shall cease to be effective from the earlier of the next Fee Adjustment Date or
the date on which an Event of Default shall occur. The Applicable Fee
Percentage effective from such earlier date and from time to time thereafter
shall be the Applicable Fee Percentage as may be applicable at such time
pursuant to this Section 3.4(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if an Event of
Default shall have occurred, the Applicable Fee Percentage shall be 0.25%.

(d) RISK PARTICIPATION FEE. The Letter of Credit Bank shall share
with the Banks, on a pro rata basis, a risk participation fee (the "Risk
Participation Fee") with respect to each Standby Letter of Credit and each Time
Draft accepted by the Letter of Credit Bank in an amount equal to the per annum
rate equal to the Applicable Loan Percentage in effect pursuant to Section
3.5(b) times the face amount of each such Standby Letter of Credit and each
accepted Time Draft. The Letter of Credit Bank shall pay such Risk
Participation Fees to the Agent for the account of the Banks on the last day of
each calendar quarter commencing December 31, 1994.

27

PAGE 60 OF 126
<PAGE> 37

(e) AGENT'S FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
sole account of the Agent an annual fee as set forth in the Agent's Fee Letter.

(f) ACCEPTANCE COMMISSION. The Borrower agrees to pay the Agent,
on behalf of the Banks, acceptance commissions ("Acceptance Commissions") with
respect to each Acceptance created by the Agent pursuant to the terms hereof in
an amount equal to the per annum rate equal to Applicable Loan Percentage in
effect pursuant to Section 3.5(b) hereof times the face amount of each
Acceptance created, for the period from the date of the creation of such
Acceptance to the date of its maturity; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, from the
Closing Date until the earlier of the delivery of the Borrower's financial
statements for the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year or one hundred twenty days (120)
after the last day of the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year, the Applicable Loan
Percentage for the purposes of this Section 3.4(f) shall be 1.75%. Each Bank
other than the Agent shall be entitled to receive an Acceptance Commission in
an amount based upon ninety-two and one-half per cent (92-1/2%) of its
Acceptance Exposure in each such Acceptance. The entire remainder of the
Acceptance Commission shall in each case be paid to and retained by the Agent.
For purposes of effecting payment of such commissions, the Borrower hereby
irrevocably directs the Agent, and the Agent agrees, to deduct on the due date
of the commission, the amount thereof from the proceeds of the discount of such
Acceptance effected by the Agent on such date.

(g) LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Letter of Credit Bank for the sole account of the Letter of Credit Bank the
fees set forth in the Letter of Credit Bank's Fee Letter.

(h) FEES NONREFUNDABLE. All fees set forth in this Section 3.4
and closing fees payable pursuant to Section 6.11 shall be paid on the date
due, in immediately available funds, to the Agent for distribution, if and as
appropriate, to the Banks and once paid, none of such fees shall be refundable
under any circumstances.

SECTION 3.5 INTEREST.

(a) REGULAR INTEREST. The Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by each Bank from the date of such
Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full at the following times
and rates per annum:

(i) PRIME RATE LOANS. During such periods as a Revolving
Credit Loan is a Prime Rate Loan, a rate per annum equal at all times
to the Prime Rate, payable quarterly, in arrears, on the last day of
each Fiscal Quarter and on the date such Prime Rate Loan shall be
converted or paid in full (whether at maturity, by reason of
acceleration or otherwise).

(ii) FED FUNDS RATE LOANS. During such periods as a
Revolving Credit Loan is a Fed Funds Rate Loan, a rate per annum equal
at all times during each Interest Period for such Loan to the sum of
the Fed Funds Rate for such Interest Period for such Loan plus the
Applicable Loan Percentage in effect at the time of the making, the

28

PAGE 61 OF 126
<PAGE> 38

conversion or continuation of such Loan, as the case may be, in
accordance with Section 3.1(h), payable on the last day of such
Interest Period and on the date such Fed Funds Rate Loan shall be
converted or paid in full (whether at maturity, by reason of 
acceleration or otherwise).

(iii) LIBOR LOANS. During such periods as a Revolving
Credit Loan is a LIBOR Loan, a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Loan Percentage in effect from time
to time from and after each Interest Adjustment Date occurring on or
prior to the date of the making, the conversion or the continuation of
such Loan, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 3.1(h),
payable (A) on the last day of each Interest Period and (B) if such
Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, three months
after the first day of such Interest Period and (C) on the date such
LIBOR Loan shall be converted to a Prime Rate Loan or a Fed Funds Rate
Loan or paid in full (whether at maturity, by reason of acceleration
or otherwise).

(b) APPLICABLE LOAN PERCENTAGE; TERMS OF ADJUSTMENT.

(i) COMMENCEMENT; CONDITIONS. So long as no
Event of Default shall exist, the Applicable Loan Percentage shall be
adjusted as herein specified as of the Closing Date and as of the
first day of the calendar month (each an "Interest Adjustment Date")
commencing after the date the Agent shall have received (A) financial
statements required by Sections 8.1(a) or 8.1(b) for the period ending
as of the last day of the Fiscal Quarter or Fiscal Year immediately
preceding such Interest Adjustment Date (each a "Determination Date")
and (B) a certificate complying with Section 8.1(c)(ii) certifying the
Borrower's Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's
Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any such Determination Date;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, subject to the provisions of clause (ii) below, the
Applicable Loan Percentage to be in effect from the Closing Date until
the earlier of the delivery of the Borrower's financial statements for
the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year or one hundred twenty days (120) after
the last day of the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year, shall be 1.75%.

(ii) CALCULATION AND DURATION OF ADJUSTMENT. On
each Interest Adjustment Date the Applicable Loan Percentage shall be
the Applicable Loan Percentage indicated in the definition of the term
"Applicable Loan Percentage" corresponding to the Borrower's
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's
Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any such Determination Date. Any
such adjustment of the Applicable Loan Percentage shall cease to be
effective commencing on the earlier of (x) the next Interest
Adjustment Date, (y) the Banking Day following the day on which the
financial statements required to be delivered under Section 8.1(a) or
8.1(b), as the case may be, for the period ending as of the last day
of the Fiscal Quarter or Fiscal Year immediately preceding the date
upon which the then Applicable Loan Percentage shall cease to be
effective or (z) the date upon which an Event of Default shall occur.
The Applicable Loan Percentage effective from such earlier date and
from time to time thereafter shall be the Applicable Loan Percentage

29

PAGE 62 OF 126
<PAGE> 39

applicable at such time pursuant to this Section 3.5(b);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) if an Event of Default (other than an
Event of Default under Section 10.1) shall occur, the Applicable Loan
Percentage shall be 2.50% and (B) if an Event of Default under Section
10.1 shall occur, the interest rate shall be the interest rate in
effect pursuant to Section 3.5(c).

(c) DEFAULT INTEREST. If any principal, interest or fees due
under this Agreement shall not be paid when due or if any Revolving Credit Note
shall not be paid at maturity, whether such maturity occurs by reason of lapse
of time or by operation of any provision of acceleration of maturity therein
contained, the principal thereof and the unpaid interest and fees thereon shall
bear interest, payable on demand, for Prime Rate Loans, LIBOR Loans and Fed
Funds Rate Loans, at a rate per annum which shall be equal at all time to the
greater of (x) two percent (2.0%) in excess of the rate per annum required to
be paid on such Loans immediately prior to the date on which such amount became
due or (y) two percent (2.0%) in excess of the Prime Rate from time to time in
effect. The Borrower acknowledges that this calculation will result in the
accrual of interest on interest and the Borrower expressly consents and agrees
to this provision.

(d) INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION.

(i) AGENT DETERMINATION; NOTICE. The Agent shall
determine the Adjusted LIBOR and the Fed Funds Rate in accordance with
the definition of LIBOR Rate and Fed Funds Rate and Adjusted LIBOR set
forth in Section 1.1. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Borrower and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by
the Agent for purposes of Section 3.5(a)(i) or (ii) or (iii).

(ii) FAILURE OF BORROWER TO ELECT. If no
Interest Period is specified in any Notice of Borrowing for any LIBOR
Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing or any Fed Funds
Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have selected an Interest Period with a duration of the
one month with respect to LIBOR Loans and seven days with respect to
Fed Funds Rate Loans. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in
accordance with Section 3.1(h) to continue any LIBOR Rate Loans
comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing into a subsequent Interest
Period (and shall not have otherwise delivered a Rate
Conversion/Continuation Request in accordance with Section 3.1(h) to
convert such Loans), subject to the limitations set forth in Section
3.1(h) such LIBOR Rate Loans shall, at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof),
automatically continue as LIBOR Rate Loans having the same Interest
Period as the immediately preceding Interest Period for such LIBOR
Loans; PROVIDED, HOWEVER , that, if an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, such LIBOR Loans shall be converted to
Prime Rate Loans. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in
accordance with Section 3.1(h) to continue or convert any Fed Funds
Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing into a subsequent
Interest Period (and shall not have otherwise delivered a Rate
Conversion/Continuation Request in accordance with Section 3.1(h) to
convert such Fed Funds Rate Loans), such Fed Funds

30

PAGE 63 OF 126
<PAGE> 40

Rate Loans shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless
repaid pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically convert to Prime Rate
Loans.

SECTION 3.6 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

(a) PAYMENTS. The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and
under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts
relating to Revolving Credit Loans, not later than 11:00 A.M. (Cleveland, Ohio
time) on the day when due in dollars to the Agent in immediately available
funds by deposit of such funds to the Agent's account maintained at the Payment
Office. Payments received after 12:00 noon (Cleveland time) on any day shall
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Banking Day. The Agent
will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the
payment of principal, interest, Unused Commitment Fees or Facility Fees or
other fees or other amounts which may be received in respect of the Obligations
of the Borrower under this Agreement ratably (other than as provided in Section
3.4(f) and amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and 3.4(g) solely to the
Agent or the Letter of Credit Bank, as the case may be) to each of the Banks
for the account of its respective Lending Office, and like funds relating to
the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the
account of its Lending Office. The funds so distributed to each Bank shall in
each case be applied by such Bank in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

(b) AUTHORIZATION TO CHARGE ACCOUNT. If and to the extent payment
owed to any Bank is not made when due hereunder or under the Note held by such
Bank, the Borrower hereby authorizes such Bank to charge from time to time
against any or all of the Borrower's general deposit accounts with such Bank
any amount so due.

(c) COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of
interest, commitment fees and letter of credit fees and all other fees shall be
made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days in each case for the
actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each
determination by the Agent (or, in the case of Section 3.7, by a Bank) of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

(d) PAYMENT NOT ON BANKING DAY. Whenever any payment hereunder or
under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Banking Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Banking Day, EXCEPT, that, if
such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBOR Loans
to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on
the immediately preceding Banking Day. Any such extension or reduction of time
shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest,
Commitment Fee or Facility Fee, as the case may be.

(e) PRESUMPTION OF PAYMENT IN FULL BY BORROWER. Unless the Agent
shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower will make or has made
such payment in full to the Agent on such date. In reliance upon such
assumption, the Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, distribute to each

31

PAGE 64 OF 126
<PAGE> 41

Bank on such due date the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the
Borrower shall not have made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall
repay to the Agent promptly upon demand the amount distributed to such Bank
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate plus the amount of any costs, expenses,
liabilities or losses incurred by the Agent in connection with its distribution
of such funds.

SECTION 3.7 RESERVES; TAXES; INDEMNITIES.

(a) RESERVES OR DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. If at any time any Law,
treaty or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or the interpretation thereof by
any governmental authority charged with the administration thereof or any
central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority shall impose (whether
or not having the force of Law), modify or deem applicable any reserve and/or
special deposit requirement (other than reserves included in the Reserve
Percentage, the effect of which is reflected in the interest rate(s) of the
LIBOR Loan(s) in question) against assets held by, or deposits in or for the
amount of any loans by, any Bank, and the result of the foregoing is to
increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a cost) to such
Bank of making or maintaining hereunder LIBOR Loans or to reduce the amount of
principal or interest received by such Bank with respect to such LIBOR Loans,
then upon demand by such Bank the Borrower shall pay to such Bank from time to
time on Interest Adjustment Dates with respect to such loans, as additional
consideration hereunder, additional amounts sufficient to fully compensate and
indemnify such Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount, assuming (which
assumption such Bank need not corroborate) such additional cost or reduced
amount was allocable to such LIBOR Loans. A certificate as to the increased
cost or reduced amount as a result of any event mentioned in this Section
3.7(a), setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be promptly submitted by
such Bank to the Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, after any such demand for compensation by any
Bank, the Borrower, upon at least three (3) Banking Days' prior written notice
to such Bank through the Agent, may prepay the affected LIBOR Loans in full or
convert all LIBOR Loans to Prime Rate Loans or Fed Funds Rate Loans regardless
of the Interest Period of any thereof. Any such prepayment or conversion shall
entitle the Banks to the prepayment compensation provided for in Section 3.3
hereof. Each Bank will notify the Borrower as promptly as practicable (with a
copy thereof delivered to the Agent) of the existence of any event which will
likely require the payment by the Borrower of any such additional amount under
this Section.

(b) IMPOSITION OF TAXES. In the event that by reason of any Law,
regulation or requirement or in the interpretation thereof by an official
authority, or the imposition of any requirement of any central bank whether or
not having the force of Law, any Bank shall, with respect to this Agreement or
any transaction under this Agreement, be subjected to any tax, levy, impost,
charge, fee, duty, deduction or withholding of any kind whatsoever (other than
any tax imposed upon the total net income of such Bank) and if any such
measures or any other similar measure shall result in an increase in the cost
to such Bank of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or in a reduction in the
amount of principal, interest or

32

PAGE 65 OF 126
<PAGE> 42

commitment fee receivable by such Bank in respect thereof, then such Bank shall
promptly notify the Borrower stating the reasons therefor. The Borrower shall
thereafter pay to such Bank upon demand from time to time on Interest
Adjustment Dates with respect to such LIBOR Loans, as additional consideration
hereunder, such additional amounts as will fully compensate such Bank for such
increased cost or reduced amount. A certificate as to any such increased cost
or reduced amount, setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be submitted
by such Bank to the Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, after any such demand for compensation by any
Bank, the Borrower, upon at least three (3) Banking Days prior written notice
to such Bank through the Agent, may prepay the affected LIBOR Loans in full or
convert all LIBOR Loans to Prime Rate Loans or Fed Funds Rate Loans regardless
of the Interest Period of any thereof. Any such prepayment or conversion shall
entitle the Banks to prepayment compensation provided for in Section 3.3
hereof.

(c) EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS UNAVAILABLE OR INTEREST RATE
UNASCERTAINABLE. In respect of any LIBOR Loans, in the event that the Agent or
any Bank shall have determined that dollar deposits of the relevant amount for
the relevant Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans are not available to the
Reference Bank in the applicable Eurodollar market or that, by reason of
circumstances affecting such market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for ascertaining the LIBOR rate applicable to such Interest Period, as the case
may be, the Agent or such Bank shall promptly give notice of such determination
to the Borrower and (i) any notice of new LIBOR Loans (or conversion of
existing loans to LIBOR Loans) previously given by the Borrower and not yet
borrowed (or converted, as the case may be) shall be deemed a notice to make
Prime Rate Loans, and (ii) the Borrower shall be obligated either to prepay or
to convert any outstanding LIBOR Loans on the last day of the then current
Interest Period or Periods with respect thereto. Any such prepayment or
conversion shall entitle the Banks to prepayment compensation provided for in
Section 3.3 hereof.

(d) OTHER INTEREST RATE UNATTAINABLE. In respect of any Fed Funds
Rate Loans, in the event that the Agent or any Bank shall have determined that,
by reason of circumstances affecting such market, adequate and reasonable means
do not exist for ascertaining the Fed Funds Rate applicable to such Interest
Period, the Agent or such Bank shall promptly give notice of such determination
to the Borrower and (i) any notice of new Fed Funds Rate Loans (or conversion
of existing Loans to Fed Funds Rate Loans) previously given by the Borrower and
not yet borrowed (or converted, as the case may be) shall be deemed a notice to
make Prime Rate Loans, and (ii) the Borrower shall be obligated either to
prepay or to convert any outstanding Fed Funds Rate Loans on the last day of
the then current Interest Period or Periods with respect thereto. Any such
prepayment or conversion shall entitle the Banks to prepayment compensation
provided for in Section 3.3 hereof.

(e) INDEMNITY. Without prejudice to any other provisions of this
Article 3, the Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Bank against any loss
or expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of any default
by the Borrower in payment when due of any amount due hereunder in respect of
any LIBOR Loan or Fed Funds Rate Loan, including, but not limited to, any loss
of profit, premium or penalty incurred by such Bank in

33

PAGE 66 OF 126
<PAGE> 43

respect of funds borrowed by it for the purpose of making or maintaining such
LIBOR Loan or Fed Funds Rate Loan, as determined by such Bank in the exercise
of its sole but reasonable discretion. A certificate as to any such loss or
expense shall be promptly submitted by such Bank to the Borrower and shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount
thereof.

(f) CHANGES IN LAW RENDERING LIBOR LOANS UNLAWFUL. If at any time
any new Law, treaty or regulation, or any change in any existing Law, treaty or
regulation, or any interpretation thereof by any governmental or other
regulatory authority charged with the administration thereof, shall make it
unlawful for any Bank to fund any LIBOR Loans which it is committed to make
hereunder with moneys obtained in the Eurodollar market, the commitment of such
Bank to fund LIBOR Loans shall, upon the happening of such event forthwith be
suspended for the duration of such illegality, and such Bank shall by written
notice to the Borrower and the Agent declare that its Commitment with respect
to such Loans has been so suspended and, if and when such illegality ceases to
exist, such suspension shall cease and such Bank shall similarly notify the
Borrower and the Agent. If any such change shall make it unlawful for any Bank
to continue in effect the funding in the applicable Eurodollar market of any
LIBOR Loan previously made by it hereunder, such Bank shall, upon the happening
of such event, notify the Borrower, the Agent and the other Banks thereof in
writing stating the reasons therefor, and the Borrower shall, on the earlier of
(i) the last day of the then current Interest Period or (ii) if required by
such Law, regulation or interpretation, on such date as shall be specified in
such notice, either convert all LIBOR Loans to Prime Rate Loans or Fed Funds
Rate Loans to the extent permissible under this Agreement or prepay all LIBOR
Loans to the Banks in full. Any such prepayment or conversion shall entitle
the Banks to prepayment compensation as provided in Section 3.3 hereof.

(g) FUNDING. Each Bank may, but shall not be required to, make
LIBOR Loans hereunder with funds obtained outside the United States.

SECTION 3.8 CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any Bank shall have determined,
that, whether in effect at the date of this Agreement or hereafter in effect,
any applicable Law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy,
or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Bank's capital allocated to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or the capital of its holding company) as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank
(or its holding company) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's policies or the policies of
its holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand
by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its holding
company) for such reduction. Each Bank will designate a different lending
office

34

PAGE 67 OF 126
<PAGE> 44

if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation
under this section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be
paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In
determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods. Within four (4) months following the date such
certificate is furnished claiming compensation by any such Bank (the "Affected
Bank"), the Borrower may replace the Affected Bank with a lending institution
satisfactory to the Agent (the consent to which may not be unreasonably
withheld by the Agent), upon such terms and conditions as are satisfactory to
the Majority Banks. Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for
any reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not
constitute a waiver of such Bank's rights to demand compensation for any
reduction in return on capital in such period or in any other period. The
protection of this Section 3.8 shall be available to each Bank regardless of
any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Law,
regulation or other condition which shall have been imposed.

SECTION 3.9 TAXES.

(a) TAXES; WITHHOLDING. Any and all payments by the Borrower
hereunder, under the Notes or the other Related Writings shall be made, in
accordance with the provisions of Article 3, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, EXCLUDING,
in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which such Bank is
organized or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by Law
to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under
any Note to any Bank or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.9) such
Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such
deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
Law. All such Taxes shall be paid by the Borrower prior to the date on which
penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,
if any such penalties or interest become due, the Borrower shall make prompt
payment thereof to the appropriate governmental authority. The Borrower shall
indemnify each Bank for the full amount of such Taxes (including any Taxes on
amounts payable under this Section 3.9) paid by the Bank and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Any
indemnification payment shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the
Bank makes written demand therefor.

(b) STAMP TAXES. The Borrower agrees to pay, and will indemnify
each Bank and the Agent for, any present or future stamp or documentary taxes
or any other excise or

35

PAGE 68 OF 126
<PAGE> 45

property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration
of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) OTHER TAXES. The Borrower will indemnify each Bank and the
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this section 3.10) paid by such Bank or the Agent (as the case
may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally asserted. Any indemnification payment shall be made
within thirty (30) days from the date such Bank or the Agent (as the case may
be) makes written demand therefor.

(d) REMOVAL OF BANK. Within four (4) months following the date
the Agent or a Bank shall make a written demand for Taxes or Other Taxes
pursuant to this Section 3.9, the Borrower may replace the Affected Bank with a
lending institution satisfactory to the Agent (the consent to which may not be
unreasonably withheld by the Agent), upon such terms and conditions as are
satisfactory to the Majority Banks (exclusive of each Affected Bank and be
computed without consideration of the Commitment of each such Affected Bank).
Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for any reduction in
return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
such Bank's rights to demand compensation for any reduction in return on
capital in such period or in any other period. The protection of this Section
shall be available to each Bank regardless of any possible contention of the
invalidity or inapplicability of the law, regulation or other condition which
shall have been imposed.

(e) REQUEST FOR REFUND. At the reasonable request of the
Borrower, a Bank or the Agent shall apply at the Borrower's expense for a
refund in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes previously paid by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 3.9 if in the opinion of such Bank or the Agent there
is a reasonable basis for such refund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Banks or the Agent shall be obligated to pursue such refund if, in its sole
good faith judgment, such action would be disadvantageous to it. If any Bank
subsequently receives from a taxing authority a refund of any Tax previously
paid by the Borrower and for which the Borrower has indemnified the Bank
pursuant to this Section 3.9, such Bank shall within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such refund, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, pay to
the Borrower the net amount of any such recovery after deducting taxes and
expenses attributable thereto.

(f) EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE. Not later than the Closing Date or, in
the case of any bank or financial institution that becomes a Bank after the
Closing Date, pursuant to Article 13, the date of the instrument of assignment
pursuant to which such bank or financial institution became a Bank, and
annually on each Anniversary Date thereafter or at such other times as the
Agent or the Borrower may request, (i) each Bank organized under the Laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall provide the Agent and the Borrower
with duly completed copies of Form 1001 or Form 4224 or any successor form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying that
such Bank is exempt from United States withholding taxes with respect to all
payments to be made to such Bank hereunder or other

36

PAGE 69 OF 126
<PAGE> 46

document satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent indicating that all
payments to be made to such Bank hereunder are not subject to such taxes and
(ii) each other Bank shall provide the Agent and the Borrower with a written
statement that it is not a non-resident alien or foreign corporation and which
otherwise satisfies Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-5(b) or any successor
regulation under the Internal Revenue Code (each such certificate or statement,
an "Exemption Certificate"). Unless the Agent and the Borrower have received
an Exemption Certificate from such Bank, the Borrower, or the Agent if the
Borrower has not withheld, may withhold taxes from such payments at the
applicable statutory rate (subject, in the case of the Borrower to the
requirements of Section 3.9(a)); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Borrower has
withheld it shall so notify the Agent. If the Borrower is required to pay
additional amounts to any Bank pursuant to this Section 3.9, such Bank shall
use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office if such
designation will thereafter avoid the need for any additional payments under
this Section 3.9 and will not, in the sole judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. A Bank which ceases to be exempt from United
States withholding taxes shall notify the Agent and the Borrower promptly
thereof.

(g) FURNISHING OF CERTIFICATE. Within 30 days after the date of
any payment of Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at its address
set forth on the signature page of the Agent to this Agreement or such other
address as the Agent notifies the Banks, the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof. The Borrower hereby represents and warrants
to the Agent and each of the Banks that no Taxes are payable in respect of any
payment made hereunder. If Taxes ever become payable in respect of any payment
hereunder or under the Notes made during a Fiscal Quarter, thereafter the
Borrower will furnish to the Agent, within (30) days after the end of such
Fiscal Quarter, at such address, a certificate from the Borrower stating that
any payments made during such Fiscal Quarter are exempt from or not subject to
Taxes.

(h) SURVIVAL OF PROVISION. Without prejudice to the survival of
any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and liabilities
of the Borrower contained in this Section 3.9 shall survive the payment in full
of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Facility Fees, Unused Commitment
Fees, Acceptance Fees, Risk Participation Fees, interest and termination of the
Commitments hereunder.

SECTION 3.10 PRO RATA TREATMENT. Except as required by Section
3.7 or Section 11.4(b) or as permitted under Section 3.9, each Revolving Credit
Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Credit
Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Revolving Credit Loans, each payment
of the Facility Fees, each payment of the Unused Commitment Fees, each payment
of Risk Participation Fees, each payment of Acceptance Fees, each reduction of
the Commitments, each Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation of Revolving Credit
Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be allocated among the
Banks in accordance with each Bank's Ratable Portion of the Total Commitment
Amount (or if the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in
accordance with the respective principal amounts of each Bank's Revolving
Credit Loans).

ARTICLE 4
ACCEPTANCES

SECTION 4.1 AGREEMENT TO CREATE ACCEPTANCES. Subject to the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Agent on behalf of the Banks agrees
to extend credit in United States Dollars to the Borrower from time to time
during the Commitment Period by creating Acceptances for the Borrower;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall (a) the aggregate Risk Participation
Exposure exceed Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000) or (b) the aggregate
principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans PLUS the aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure exceed the Total Commitment Amount.

SECTION 4.2 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. The Borrower shall have the
option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to request
Acceptances hereunder (i) having a face amount not less than Two Million United
States Dollars (U.S. $2,000,000) or additional increments of Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) or any integral multiple thereof (or such lesser
amount as may be acceptable to the Agent), payable in United States Dollars,
drawn by the Borrower on the Agent in accordance with this Agreement, either to
the order of the Borrower, in which case such draft shall be endorsed by the
Borrower in blank, or to the order of the Agent, (ii) covering a specified
shipment or shipments being purchased or sold by the Borrower, and (iii)
maturing on a Banking Day not more than 180 days after the date of such draft
and not more than 210 days after the date of such shipment or shipments, all as
specified in the relevant Acceptance Request; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
Acceptance shall (a) have a tenor in excess of the period of time which is
usual and reasonably necessary to finance transactions of similar character,
(b) be, together with all other financings relating to the shipment in which
such Acceptance relates, in an aggregate face amount in excess of the c.i.f.
value of such shipment, (c) be created more than thirty (30) days after or more
than thirty (30) days before the date of the shipment to which such Acceptance
relates, or (d) extend beyond the termination of the Commitment Period.

SECTION 4.3 CONDITIONS TO ACCEPTANCES. The obligation of Agent
to create each Acceptance hereunder is subject to the following conditions
precedent: (i) such Acceptance shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.5
hereof and shall also comply with applicable regulations of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States governing banker's
acceptances and shall (if accepted and endorsed by a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System or a bank authorized to create eligible acceptances) be eligible
under such regulations for purchase or, if such Acceptance has a maturity at
the time of discount of not more than ninety (90) days sight, exclusive of days
of grace, for discount by the Federal Reserve Banks.

SECTION 4.4 ACCEPTANCE OBLIGATIONS. The Borrower is obligated,
and hereby unconditionally agrees, to pay the Agent the face amount of each
Acceptance created by the Agent in accordance with the Acceptance Request sent
pursuant to Section 4.5 hereof on the maturity date thereof, or on such earlier
date as may be required pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

38

PAGE 71 OF 126
<PAGE> 48

SECTION 4.5 ACCEPTANCE REQUEST. The obligation of the Agent to
create Acceptances hereunder is conditioned, in the case of each Acceptance,
upon receipt by the Agent not later than 12:00 noon (Cleveland, Ohio time) of
each requested creation of an Acceptance by a request by the Borrower on the
Banking Day which is the requested date of the Acceptance. Each such request
(an "Acceptance Request") shall be transmitted by the Borrower to the Agent by
telecopier or such other means as the Agent agrees to in writing, substantially
in the form of Exhibit B-5, specifying therein the requested (A) date of the
Acceptance, (B) number of days such Acceptance is to remain outstanding and the
maturity date thereof and (C) containing the information and certifications
contained in the Acceptance Request in the form of Exhibit B-8 attached hereto.
The Borrower may make an Acceptance Request telephonically so long as written
confirmation of such Acceptance Request is received by the Agent by 1:00 p.m.
(Cleveland, Ohio time) on the day of such telephonic request. The Agent may
rely on such telephonic request to the same extent that the Agent may rely on a
written Acceptance Request. Each Acceptance Request, whether written or
telephonic, shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and subject to the
indemnification provisions of Article 3. The Borrower shall bear all risks
relating to the method of communicating an Acceptance Request elected by the
Borrower. The Agent may shall give to each Bank prompt notice on the day
received of each such Acceptance Request by telecopier.

SECTION 4.6 DISCOUNT. The Agent agrees, on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, that on the date of the creation by it of each
Acceptance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement the Agent will (i)
discount such Acceptance at the Agent's then current discount rate for prime
banker's acceptances of equal tenor and face amount and (ii) pay to the
Borrower an amount equal to the difference between the proceeds of such
discount and the Acceptance Commission payable to the Agent for distribution to
the Banks in respect of such Acceptance under Section 3.4(f) hereof.

SECTION 4.7 SUPPLY OF DRAFTS. To enable the Agent to create
Acceptances in the manner specified herein, the Borrower shall supply the Agent
immediately after the execution of this Agreement, and thereafter promptly upon
request by the Agent, with a sufficient number of blank drafts conforming with
the requirements of this Agreement and duly executed on behalf of the Borrower,
which the Agent shall hold in safekeeping prior to use hereunder. The Agent
shall indemnify the Borrower or any Bank for any loss the Borrower or any Bank
may suffer resulting solely from the improper use of any of such blank drafts
by any of Agent's officers, directors or employees and the creation of any
acceptances other than those authorized by the Borrower pursuant to Section 4.5
hereof. The Agent is irrevocably authorized to complete such draft in the
manner specified in the Acceptance Request. In case any authorized signatory
of the Borrower whose signature shall appear on any draft shall cease to have
such authority before the creation of an Acceptance with respect to such draft,
the obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under such Acceptance shall
nevertheless be valid for all purposes as if such authority had remained in
force until such creation.

39

<PAGE> 49

SECTION 4.8 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS; OVERDUE PAYMENTS; 
CANCELLATION OF DRAFTS.

(a) PAYMENTS. Unless otherwise provided herein, all payments of
principal, interest, Acceptance Obligations, premiums, penalties, fees and
other amounts which may become due hereunder, shall be made to the Agent in
immediately available funds for the account of the Banks, and the Agent shall
promptly distribute to each Bank in immediately available funds its ratable
share of the amount of principal, interest, premiums, penalties, Acceptance
Commissions, fees and other amounts which may become due hereunder, received by
it for the account of such Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.10.

(b) PAYMENTS NOT ON BANKING DAY. Whenever any payment pertaining
to an Acceptance Obligation or Time Draft accepted by the Letter of Credit Bank
to be made hereunder shall become due on a day other than a Banking Day, then
such due date shall be the immediately succeeding Banking Day and the Borrower
agrees to pay interest on such amount, in respect of each day during the period
from the date such amount was originally due until the immediately succeeding
Banking Day at a rate per annum equal to (i) the discount rate applicable to
the Acceptance with respect to which such Acceptance Obligation was payable or
(ii) the Prime Rate from time to time in effect with respect to such Time
Draft, as the case may be.

(c) OVERDUE PAYMENTS. Without limiting the rights of the Agent or
any Bank under this Agreement or under applicable Law, the Borrower agrees to
pay interest, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, on any amount payable
under any Acceptance which shall not have been paid when due, in respect of
each day during the period from the date such amount became due until the same
shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall be two percent (2.0%) in
excess of the Prime Rate from time to time in effect.

(d) COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest, the Acceptance
Commission, and the applicable discount rate pertaining to Acceptances shall be
made based on a year having 360 days and calculated for the actual number of
days elapsed.

SECTION 4.9 CANCELLATION OF DRAFTS. Upon payment by the Agent of
an Acceptance, the Agent shall, if the face amount of the Acceptance has been
received by the Agent from the Borrower, cancel the draft with respect to which
payment of the Acceptance was made and forward such cancelled draft, or a
photocopy thereof, to the Borrower.

SECTION 4.10 ACCEPTANCE OF RISK PARTICIPATION. The Agent hereby
agrees that it will sell simultaneously with the creation of each Acceptance,
and each Bank hereby agrees that it will buy simultaneously with the creation
of each such Acceptance (subject to the following sentence) an undivided pro
rata participation in any payment which Agent makes for the account of the
Borrower under any Acceptance for which payment Agent is not otherwise
immediately reimbursed by the Borrower. The aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of such Bank plus such Bank's aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure (after taking into effect such Bank's Ratable Portion of
the risk participation created under this Section 4.10) shall not exceed such
Bank's Commitment in effect from time to time. The sale

40

PAGE 73 OF 126
<PAGE> 50

of the risk participation by the Agent, and the purchase thereof by each Bank
respectively, shall occur simultaneously with and shall be evidenced by each
Acceptance.

SECTION 4.11 REIMBURSEMENT OF AGENT. The Agent will notify each
other Bank promptly if the Agent makes any payment under an Acceptance which is
not immediately reimbursed by the Borrower. Upon demand by the Agent, each
Bank shall pay to the Agent that Bank's Ratable Portion of each such payment
made by the Agent. Each such payment shall for all purposes hereunder be deemed
to be a Prime Rate Loan (it being understood that (i) each Bank's obligation to
make such payment is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
any event or circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence of any Default
or Possible Default hereunder or the failure of any condition precedent set
forth in Article 7 to be satisfied and (ii) each such payment shall be made
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever). In
addition, upon demand by the Agent, each Bank will pay an amount equal to such
Bank's pro rata share of all costs and expenses not reimbursed by the Borrower
which have been incurred or made by the Agent as the result of, or in
connection with, any action including, but not limited to, legal action which
may be taken by Agent to obtain reimbursement for payments made by Agent under
any Acceptance. The principal amount, fees, interest and premiums with respect
to unpaid Acceptance Obligations deemed to be Prime Rate Loans pursuant to this
Section 4.11 shall be recorded on or in respect of the Revolving Credit Note by
each Bank from time to time on any ledger or other record of each Bank and each
Bank shall record such information by such other method as such Bank may
generally employ in accordance with Section 3.1(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
failure to make any such record shall in no way detract from the Borrower's
obligations under such Bank's Revolving Credit Note. The aggregate unpaid
Acceptance Obligations shown on the aforesaid records of such Bank shall be
rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on
such Revolving Credit Note.

SECTION 4.12 CONTINUANCE OF ACCEPTANCES. The Agent, the Banks,
the Letter of Credit Bank and the Borrower agree that with respect to those
certain banker's acceptances or time drafts identified on the Supplemental
Schedule attached hereto which have been issued for the account of the Borrower
by Society prior to the date of this Agreement (a) such banker's acceptances
("Pre- Closing Date Acceptances") shall be deemed to be Acceptances under this
Agreement as of the date this Agreement is becomes effective pursuant to
Section 14.7, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except
that the Borrower shall not be required by virtue of this Section 4.12 to pay
any additional Acceptance Commission or discount fees for the deemed issuance
of Pre-Closing Date Acceptances hereunder) and (ii) the Borrower shall have all
obligations hereunder in respect of such Pre-Closing Date Acceptances and the
Agent shall be deemed to be the issuer or acceptor thereof.

SECTION 4.13 TERMINATION OF COMMITMENT; INDEMNIFICATION; 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

(a) TERMINATION OF COMMITMENT. In the event that (i) any
restriction is imposed on the Agent (including, without limitation, any legal
lending or acceptance limits imposed by the United States of America or any
political subdivision thereof) which in the judgment of the

41

PAGE 74 OF 126
<PAGE> 51

Agent after consultation with the Borrower would prevent the Agent from
creating Acceptances or maintaining its commitment to create Acceptances or
(ii) there shall have occurred, at any time during the term of this Agreement
(a) any adverse change or a development involving a prospective adverse change
affecting the condition of the Borrower which would materially impair the
ability of the Borrower to meet its Acceptance Obligations, (b) any outbreak of
hostilities or other national or international crisis or change in economic
conditions if the effect of such outbreak, crisis or change would make the
creation of Acceptances or the discount or sale thereof impracticable, (c) the
enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute,
regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which
would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Borrower to perform
its obligations under this Agreement, or (d) the taking of any action by any
government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which would
have a material adverse effect on the creation or marketing of banker's
acceptances in the United States of America, then the Agent, in the case of the
occurrence of any event described above, shall give written notice of the
occurrence of such event to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon the
commitment of the Agent to create Acceptances shall terminate on the effective
date of such notice. The Borrower shall forthwith pay to the Agent all
Acceptance Obligations on the maturity date of the Acceptance to which each
Acceptance Obligation relates.

(b) SPECIAL INDEMNIFICATION FOR INELIGIBILITY. In the event that
any Acceptance for any reason whatsoever is deemed by the Agent not to be
eligible for discount under the Federal Reserve Act (12 USC 372), the Borrower
agrees to indemnify Agent and each Bank on demand for any and all additional
costs, expenses or damages incurred by Agent or any Bank, directly or
indirectly arising out of such ineligibility, including, without limitation,
any costs of maintaining reserves in respect to any such Acceptance and any
costs or expenses arising in any manner from the illiquidity of the market for
ineligible bankers' acceptances. A statement as to additional amounts owed to
the Agent or any Bank, showing in detail the basis for the calculation thereof,
submitted in good faith to the Borrower by the Agent or any such Bank, shall be
final, conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error.

(c) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, except for
gross negligence or willful misconduct, for any action taken or omitted under

otherwise immediately reimbursed by the

44

PAGE 77 OF 126
<PAGE> 54

Borrower in an amount equal to such Bank's Ratable Portion. The aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of such Bank PLUS
such Bank's aggregate Risk Participation Exposure (after taking into effect
such Bank's Ratable Portion of the risk participation created under this
Section 5.3) shall not exceed such Bank's Commitment in effect from time to
time. The sale of the risk participation by the Letter of Credit Bank and the

Credit, as the case may be.

Draft or at maturity of an accepted Time Draft which is not immediately
reimbursed by the Borrower. Upon demand by the Agent each such other Bank
shall pay to the Agent that Bank's Ratable Portion of each such payment made by
the Agent. Each such payment shall for all purposes hereunder be deemed to be
an Prime Rate Loan (it being understood that (i) each Bank's obligation to make
such payment is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
event or circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence of any Possible
Default hereunder or the failure of any condition precedent set forth in
Article 7 to be satisfied and (ii) each such payment shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever). In addition, upon
demand by the Letter of Credit Bank through the Agent, each other Bank will pay
an amount equal to such Bank's pro rata share of all costs and expenses not
reimbursed by the Borrower which have been incurred or made by the Letter of
Credit Bank as the result of, or in connection with, any action including, but
not limited to, legal action which may be taken by Agent to obtain
reimbursement for payments made by Agent under any Commercial Letter of Credit,
Standby Letter of Credit or Time Draft.

(c) RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF LETTER OF CREDIT BANK. Neither the
Letter of Credit Bank, nor any of its correspondents, shall be responsible,
provided it has exercised reasonable care, as to any document presented under a
Letter of Credit, or any renewal or extension thereof, which appears to be
regular on its face and appears on its face to conform to the terms of the
Letter of Credit and to make reasonable reference thereto, for the validity or
sufficiency of any signature or endorsement, for delay in giving any notice or
failure of any instrument to bear adequate reference to the Letter of Credit,
or to any renewal or extension thereof, or failure of documents not clearly
specified in the Letter of Credit to accompany any instrument at negotiation,
or for failure of any person to note the amount of any draft on the reverse of
the Letter of Credit or on any renewal or extension thereof. Any action,
inaction or omission on the part of the Letter of Credit Bank or any of its
correspondents, under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or any renewal
or extension thereof or the related instruments or documents, if in good faith
and in conformity with such Laws, regulations or customs as are applicable and
the terms of this Section 5.3, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not
place the Letter of Credit Bank or any of its correspondents under any
liability to the Borrower, in the absence of negligence by the Letter of Credit
Bank or its correspondents. The Letter of Credit Bank's rights, powers,
privileges and immunities specified in or arising under

45

PAGE 78 OF 126
<PAGE> 55

this Agreement are in addition to any heretofore or at any time hereafter
otherwise created or arising, whether by statute or rule of Law or contract.

(d) EFFECT OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CUSTOM. All Letters of Credit
issued hereunder will, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided, be
governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993
Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500, and any
subsequent revisions thereof.

(e) TERMINATION OF LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENT. In the event that
(i) any restriction is imposed on the Letter of Credit Bank (including, without
limitation, any legal lending or acceptance limits imposed by the United States
of America or any political subdivision thereof) which in the judgment of the
Letter of Credit Bank after consultation with the Borrower would prevent the
Letter of Credit Bank from issuing Letters of Credit or maintaining its
commitment to issue Letters of Credit or (ii) there shall have occurred, at any
time during the term of this Agreement (a) any adverse change or a development
involving a prospective adverse change affecting the condition of the Borrower
which would materially impair the ability of the Borrower to meet its
obligations under this Article 5, (b) any outbreak of hostilities or other
national or international crisis or change in economic conditions if the effect
of such outbreak, crisis or change would make the creation of Letters of
Credit, Time Drafts or the discount or sale thereof impracticable, (c) the
enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute,
regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which
would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Borrower to perform
its obligations under this Agreement, or (d) the taking of any action by any
government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which would
have a material adverse effect on the creation or marketing of Time Drafts in
the United States of America, then the Letter of Credit Bank, through the
Agent, in the case of the occurrence of any event described above, shall give
written notice of the occurrence of such event to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon the commitment of the Letter of Credit Bank to issue Letters of
Credit shall terminate on the effective date of such notice. The Borrower
shall forthwith pay to the Letter of Credit Bank all obligations in respect of
Letters of Credit or Time Drafts on the maturity date of such Time Draft or
date of drawing of such Letter of Credit.

SECTION 5.4 CONTINUING LETTERS OF CREDIT. The Agent, the Banks,
the Letter of Credit Bank and the Borrower agree that with respect to those
certain letters of credit or time drafts identified on the Supplemental
Schedule attached hereto which have been issued for the account of the Borrower
by Society prior to the date of this Agreement (a) such letters of credit or
time drafts shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit or Time Drafts under this
Agreement as of the date this Agreement becomes effective pursuant to Section
14.7, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except that the
Borrower shall not be required by virtue of this Section 5.4 to pay any
additional fees for the deemed issuance of such Letters of Credit or Time
Drafts hereunder) and (ii) the Borrower shall have all obligations hereunder in
respect of such Letters of Credit and the Letter of Credit Bank shall be deemed
to be the issuer or acceptor thereof, as the case may be. The Letter of Credit
Bank shall pay the Risk Participation Fees in respect of such Letters of Credit
in accordance with Section 3.4(d).

ARTICLE 9
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Subject to the exceptions in the Supplemental Schedule, the Borrower
represents and warrants to each of the Banks as follows:

SECTION 9.1 EXISTENCE. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
is a corporation duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the state of its incorporation and is duly qualified and authorized
to do business wherever it owns any real estate or personal property or
transacts any substantial business (except in jurisdictions in which failure to
so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 9.2 POWER, AUTHORIZATION AND CONSENT. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Notes or any Guaranty of
Payment by the Borrower and any Subsidiary, as the case may be, and of all
Related Writings to which it is party (a) are within the Borrower's or the
Subsidiary legal power and authority, (b) have been duly authorized by all
necessary or proper action of such the Borrower or the Subsidiary, (c) do not
require the consent or approval of any governmental body, agency, authority or
any other Person which has not been obtained and (d) will not violate (i) any
provision of Law applicable to the Borrower or the Subsidiary, (ii) any
provision of the Borrower's or the Subsidiary, as

62

PAGE 95 OF 126
<PAGE> 72

the case may be, certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws or
regulations, or (iii) any material agreement or material indenture by which the
Borrower or the Subsidiary or the property of the Borrower or the Subsidiary is
bound, except where such violation specified in this clause (iii) would not
have a materially adverse effect on the Borrower or the Subsidiary, or (e) will
not result in the creation or imposition of any lien or encumbrance on any
property or assets of the Borrower or the Subsidiary except as provided herein.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement by the
Borrower and FCA of Ohio (a) are within the Borrower's and FCA of Ohio's legal
power and authority, (b) have been duly authorized by all necessary or proper
action of the Borrower and FCA of Ohio, and (C) will not violate any provision
of the Borrower's or FCA of Ohio's, as the case may be, Articles of
Incorporation or Regulations.

SECTION 9.3 LITIGATION; PROCEEDINGS. No action, suit,
investigation or proceeding is now pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower,
threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries at Law, in equity or
otherwise, or with respect to this Agreement, any Guaranty of Payment or any
Related Writing, before any court, board, commission, agency or instrumentality
of any federal, state, local or foreign government or of any agency or
subdivision thereof, or before any arbitrator or panel of arbitrators which
would or might reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 9.4 ERISA COMPLIANCE. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has incurred any material accumulated funding deficiency within the
meaning of the ERISA, and the regulations thereunder. No Reportable Event has
occurred with respect to any Plan which may result in any material liability
against the Borrower or any Subsidiary. The Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, established under ERISA has not asserted that the Borrower or any
Subsidiary has incurred any material liability in connection with any Plan. No
Lien has been attached and no person has, to the best of the Borrower's
knowledge, threatened to attach a lien on any property of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary as a result of the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's failing to comply
with ERISA or regulations. As used in this subsection "material" means the
measure of a matter of significance which shall be determined as being an
amount equal to five per cent (5%) of the Borrower's Consolidated Tangible Net
Worth.

SECTION 9.5 FINANCIAL CONDITION. The consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year ending
January 29, 1994, previously delivered to the Banks, are true and complete
(including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a disclosure of
all material contingent liabilities), have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with
those used during their next preceding Fiscal Year (except as noted therein)
and fairly present their then financial condition and operations for the Fiscal
Year then ending. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Form 10-Q Report filed
by the Borrower with the SEC for the Fiscal Quarter ending July 30, 1994, there
has been no material change in the Borrower or any Subsidiary's financial
condition, properties or business since that date.

SECTION 9.6 PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION. The pro forma
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at July 30,
1994, but after giving effect to the Acquisition, in the good faith judgment of
the Borrower presents fairly on a pro forma

63

PAGE 96 OF 126
<PAGE> 73

basis what is the consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries would be on and as of such date were the Acquisition to be
consummated on such date.

SECTION 9.7 SOLVENCY. The Borrower has received consideration
which is the reasonable equivalent value of the obligations and liabilities
that the Borrower has incurred to the Banks. The Borrower is not insolvent as
defined in any applicable state or federal statute, nor will the Borrower be
rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Note
to the Banks. The Borrower is not engaged or about to engage in any business
or transaction for which the assets retained by it shall be an unreasonably
small capital, taking into consideration the obligations to the Banks incurred
hereunder. The Borrower does not intend to, nor does it believe that it will,
incur debts beyond its ability to pay them as they mature.

SECTION 9.8 DEFAULT. No Possible Default exists hereunder, nor
will any begin to exist immediately after the execution and delivery hereof.

SECTION 9.9 LAWFUL OPERATIONS. Except as set forth in the
Supplemental Schedule, the operations of the Borrower and the operations of
each of its Subsidiaries are in full compliance as of the Closing Date with all
requirements imposed by Law or regulation, whether federal, state or local
including (without limitation) all Environmental Laws, occupational safety and
health Laws and zoning ordinances except where the noncompliance with any such
Laws could not be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, that this Section 9.9 shall not apply to any noncompliance
if and to the extent that the same is being contested in good faith by timely
and appropriate proceedings which are effective to stay enforcement thereof and
against which appropriate reserves have been established.

SECTION 9.10 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT STATUS. Neither the Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or an "affiliated
person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment
company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (15 U.S.C. Section 80(a)(1), et seq.).

SECTION 9.11 REGULATION G/REGULATION U/REGULATION X COMPLIANCE.
Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as
one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying "margin stock" (as defined by Regulation U of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (as
amended from time to time) and all official rulings and interpretations
thereunder or thereof and at no time shall more than 25% of the value of the
assets of the Borrower or the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries that
are subject to any "arrangement" (as such term is used in section 221.2(g) of
Regulation U) be represented by "margin stock". No part of the proceeds of any
Revolving Credit Loan will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether
immediately, incidentally or ultimately, (i) to purchase or to extend credit to
others for the purpose of purchasing "margin stock" (other than any purchase by
the Borrower of the common stock of the Borrower as permitted by the terms of
this Agreement), or to carry or to extend credit to others for the purpose of
carrying stock which will be "margin stock" after giving effect to the
Revolving Credit Loans or (ii) for any purpose that entails a violation of, or
is inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of

64

PAGE 97 OF 126
<PAGE> 74

the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States,
including Regulation G, U or X.

SECTION 9.12 FULL DISCLOSURE. No information, exhibits or reports
furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or any Bank
omits to state any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading in light of the circumstances and purposes for which such
information was provided. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has
provided all information requested by the Agent or any Bank and all such
information is complete and accurate in all material respects.

67

PAGE 100 OF 126
<PAGE> 77

amount of Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding, shall have the right in
their discretion, by directing the Agent, on behalf of the Banks, to give
written notice to the Borrower, to

(1) terminate the Commitments and the credits hereby
established, if not theretofore terminated, and forthwith upon such
election the obligations of the Banks, and each thereof, to make any
further loan or loans hereunder and to risk participate in Letters of
Credit and Acceptances hereunder, and the obligation of the Agent to
create Acceptances and the obligation of the Letter of Credit Bank to
issue Standby Letters of Credit, immediately shall be terminated,
and/or

(2) accelerate the maturity of all of the Borrower's
Obligations to the Banks (if it be not already due and payable),
whereupon all of the Borrower's Obligations to the Banks and the Agent
shall become and (including but not limited to the Notes and the
Acceptance Obligations and all reimbursement obligations under Letters
of Credit) thereafter be immediately due and payable in full without
any presentment or demand and without any further or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

SECTION 11.2 AUTOMATIC DEFAULTS. If any Event of Default referred
to in Section 10.9 hereof shall occur,

(1) all of the Commitments and the credits hereby
established shall automatically and forthwith terminate, if not
theretofore terminated, and no Bank thereafter shall be under any

Agent thereafter be under any obligation to create Acceptances
hereunder, nor shall the Letter of Credit Bank be under any obligation

other Bank Debt and the Agent shall thereupon become and thereafter be

payable), all without any presentment, demand or notice of any kind,
which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

Each Bank agrees that, unless so requested by the Agent with the consent of the
Majority Banks, it shall not take or cause to be taken any action to declare
the Commitments terminated or to declare payable or collect the amounts
referred to above that is independent from any action taken or to be taken by
the Agent, unless such action is taken in connection with an Event of Default
described in Section 10.1 or 10.9.

SECTION 11.3 OFFSETS. If there shall occur or exist any Possible
Default referred to in Section 10.9 hereof or if the maturity of the Notes or

68

PAGE 101 OF 126
<PAGE> 78

and all Debt then owing by the Borrower to that Bank (including, without
limitation, any participation purchased or to be purchased pursuant to Section
11.4 hereof), whether or not the same shall then have matured, any and all
deposit balances and all other indebtedness then held or owing by that Bank to
or for the credit or account of the Borrower, all without notice to or demand
upon the Borrower or any other person, all such notices and demands being
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

SECTION 11.4 EQUALIZATION PROVISION; SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

(a) EQUALIZATION OF ADVANTAGE. Subject to the provisions of
Section 11.4(b) below, each Bank agrees with the other Banks that if it at any
time shall obtain any Advantage over the other Banks in respect of the
Borrower's Obligations to the Banks (except under Section 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 or 14.4
hereof), it will purchase from the other Banks, for cash and at par, such
additional participation in the Borrower's Debt to the Banks as shall be
necessary to nullify the Advantage. If any said Advantage resulting in the
purchase of an additional participation as aforesaid shall be recovered in
whole or in part from the Bank receiving the Advantage, each such purchase
shall be rescinded, and the purchase price restored (but without interest
unless the Bank receiving the Advantage is required to pay interest on the
Advantage to the person recovering the Advantage from such Bank) ratably to the
extent of the recovery. Each Bank further agrees with the other Banks that if
it at any time shall receive any payment for or on behalf of the Borrower on
any indebtedness owing by the Borrower to that Bank by reason of offset of any
deposit or other indebtedness, it will apply such payment first to any and all
indebtedness owing by the Borrower to that Bank pursuant to this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any participation purchased or to be purchased
pursuant to this Section 11.4) until the Borrower's Obligations have been paid
in full. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from
the other Banks pursuant to this Section may exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Bank were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

(b) SHARING OF PAYMENTS. Upon the occurrence and continuation of
an Event of Default, the Borrower, the Agent and each of the Banks under this
Agreement, each of the Banks having Negotiated Bid Loans, Outside Loans or
loans under the Swingline Facility then outstanding (collectively, the "Sharing
Banks") agree that all payments made to any Bank in respect of the Revolving
Credit Loans, the Negotiated Bid Loans, the Outside Loans or loans in respect
of the Swingline Facility (such loans to be collectively referred to in the
aggregate as the "Subject Loans") shall be remitted to the Agent by the
Borrower, or by any Sharing Bank receiving any such payment after the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, for application
by the Agent as follows: all payments made to the Agent in respect of the
Subject Loans shall be made (i) to each Sharing Bank in respect of the
Revolving Credit Loans, the interest and fees due in respect of such Revolving
Credit Loans, and the Swingline Facility and such interest as may be due
Society in respect of outstanding loans under the Swingline Facility on a pro
rata basis based upon the percentage such Subject Loans of such Bank bear to
the aggregate of all such Subject Loans then outstanding and (ii) upon payment
in full of all amounts to be paid pursuant to the preceding clause (i), to the
Sharing Banks on a pro rata basis based upon the percentage the aggregate of
then outstanding Negotiated Bid

69

PAGE 102 OF 126
<PAGE> 79

Loans and the then outstanding Outside Loans of such Sharing Bank bears to the
aggregate of all of the Negotiated Bid Loans and the Outside Loans then
outstanding. Each Sharing Bank may apply any such payment received pursuant to
this Section 11.4(b) to the amounts owing to such Sharing Bank in respect of
such the Subject Loans of such Sharing Bank in such manner and in such order as
such Sharing Bank shall determine in its sole discretion. Each Sharing Bank
agrees the such Sharing Bank shall provide that any transferee (whether by
absolute assignment or participation) of all or any portion of any Negotiated
Bid Loan, Outside Loan or any loan in respect of the Swingline Facility shall
be bound by the provisions of this Section 11.4(b) and Article 12 hereof.

The Banks each hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no

demand for out-of-pocket expenses, if any, reasonably incurred by it as such.

SECTION 12.12 AGENT'S INDEMNITY. The Banks shall indemnify the
Agent (to the extent the Agent is not reimbursed by the Borrower) from and
against (a) any loss or liability (other than any caused by the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct and other than any loss to the Agent resulting
from the Borrower's non-payment of agency fees owed solely to the Agent)
incurred by the Agent as such in respect of this Agreement, the Notes, the
Letters of Credit, the Acceptances, any Time Draft, any Guaranty of Payment or
any Related Writing (as the Agent) and (b) any out-of-pocket expenses incurred

Guaranty of Payment, any Letter of Credit, any Acceptance, any Time Draft or
any Related Writing (other than any caused by the Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct) including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
disbursements of legal counsel of its own selection (including, without
limitation, the reasonable interdepartmental charges of its salaried attorneys)

remedies as the Agent (other than the loss, liability or costs incurred by the
Agent in the defense of any claim against it by the Banks arising in connection
with its actions in its capacity as Agent); provided, however, that each Bank
shall be liable for only its Ratable Portion of the whole loss or liability.

time resign as such by giving ten (10) days' prior written notice to the
Borrower and to each Bank; and the Majority Banks may remove the Agent at any

Borrower. In any such case, the Majority Banks may appoint a successor to the
resigned or removed agent (the "Former Agent"), provided that the Majority
Banks obtain the Borrower's prior written consent to the successor (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), by giving written notice to the
Borrower, the Former Agent and each Bank not participating in the appointment;
provided, however, that, if at the time of the proposed resignation or removal
of an Agent, the Borrower is the subject of an action referred to in Section
10.9 or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing the
Borrower's consent shall not be required. In the absence of a timely
appointment, the Former Agent shall have the right (but not the duty) to make a
temporary appointment of any Bank (but only with that Bank's consent) to act as
its successor pending an appointment pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. In either case, the successor Agent shall deliver its written
acceptance of appointment to the Borrower, to each Bank and to the Former
Agent, whereupon (a) the Former Agent shall execute and deliver such
assignments and other writings as the successor Agent may reasonably require to
facilitate its being and acting as the Agent, (b) the successor Agent shall in
any event automatically acquire and assume all the rights and duties as those
prescribed for the Agent by this Article 12 and (c) the Former Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the Related
Writings.

or any rule or regulation thereunder. Subject to the

73

obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against any Other Bank in any way relating to or
arising out of the cash management or similar services provided by such Bank to

in connection therewith.

be required and any Bank may consummate a transfer contemplated by Section 13.1
notwithstanding the requirements of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
13.1(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any Bank may at any time

Commitment, its Risk Participation Exposure and in all of its Loans have been

(marked "replaced") held by the transferor and (iii) if only a portion of a
Bank's interest in its Commitment, its Risk Participation Exposure and its
Loans has been transferred, a new Revolving Credit Note to each of the
transferor and the transferee against return of the original such Notes of the
transferor (marked "replaced") held by the transferor.

(d) PARTIES. Upon satisfaction of the requirements of this

documents set forth in Section 13.1(b), (i) the transferee shall become and
thereafter be deemed to be a "Bank" for the purposes of this Agreement and (ii)

Agreement only if and to the extent that the transfer shall not have been a
transfer of its entire interest in its Commitment, its Risk Participation
Exposure and its Loans, (B) shall cease to be and thereafter shall no longer be
deemed to be a "Bank" in the case of any transfer of its entire interest in its
Commitment, its Risk Participation Exposure and its Loans and (C) the signature
pages hereto and Annex A hereto shall be automatically amended, without further
action, to reflect the result of any such transfer.

SECTION 13.2 SALE OF PARTICIPATIONS. Each Bank shall have the
right at any time or times to sell one or more participations or
subparticipations to a financial institution, as the case may be, in all or any
part of (a) that Bank's Commitment, (b) that Bank's Risk Participation
Exposure, (c) any Loan made by that Bank, (d) any Note delivered to that Bank
pursuant to this Agreement, and (e) that Bank's participations, if any,
purchased pursuant to Section 11.4 or this Section 13.2.

(a) BENEFITS OF PARTICIPANT. The provisions of Sections 3.7, 3.8
and 3.9 shall inure to the benefit of each purchaser of a participation or
subparticipation (provided that each such participant shall look solely to the
seller of its participation for those benefits and the Borrower's liabilities,
if any, under any of those sections shall not be increased as a result of the
sale of any such participation) and Agent shall continue to distribute payments
pursuant to this Agreement as if no participation has been sold.

(b) RIGHTS RESERVED. In the event any Bank shall sell any
participation or subparticipation, that Bank shall, as between itself and the
purchaser, retain all of its rights (including, without limitation, rights to
enforce against the Borrower this Agreement and the Related Writings) and
duties pursuant to this Agreement and the Related Writings, including, without
limitation, that Bank's right to approve any waiver, consent or amendment
pursuant to Section 14.1, except if and to the extent that any such waiver,
consent or amendment would

<PAGE> 85

(i) reduce any fee or commission allocated to the
participation or subparticipation, as the case may be,

(ii) reduce the amount of any principal payment on any

to the participation or subparticipation, as the case
may be.

(c) NO DELEGATION. No participation or subparticipation shall

that the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have many trade secrets and much

any governmental agency having any regulatory authority over that Bank or its
securities or in response to legal process, (ii) to any other party to this
Agreement, (iii) or to any affiliate of any Bank or to any actual or

financial institution) of all or part of that Bank's rights arising out of or
in connection with the Related Writings and this Agreement or any thereof so
long as such affiliate, prospective transferee, participant or subparticipant

13.3, (iv) to anyone if it shall have been already publicly disclosed (other
