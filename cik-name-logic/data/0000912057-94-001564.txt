PRESS RELEASE

RELEASE DATE: April 25, 1994

CONTACT PERSON: Bernhard M. Koch 610/889-7400

Laurentian Capital Corporation, a life insurance holding company based in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, today reported that it used funds from internal
resources to repay $10 million of debt under its existing US $55 million
Revolving Underwriting Facility which expired today and refinanced the balance.

The Company said it entered into a new five year credit agreement in the amount
of $45 million with a syndicate of four international banks led by National
Bank of Canada. The banks participating are National Bank of Canada, National
Westminster Bank PLC, The Daiwa Bank, Ltd. and Rabobank Nederland. This
transaction will result in a significant reduction in interest expense over
the term of the new credit facility.

Laurentian Capital Corporation (LQ-AMEX) has assets of approximately $976
million and total life insurance in force in excess of $2.8 billion.
Laurentian's primary life insurance subsidiaries are Loyal American Life

amount of the Commitments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such termination or
reduction shall be permitted (y) if the Stand-By Fee on the amount of the
Commitments proposed to be so terminated or reduced, accrued to the effective
date of such requested termination or reduction is not paid by such effective
date or (z) if, after giving effect to such termination or reduction and to any
repayment of the Revolving Loans made on the effective date of such requested
termination or reduction, the Revolving Loans which may be outstanding on the

subsection 2.3.2 in the inverse order of the respective effective dates thereof;
and

partial reduction of the Commitments, shall be imputed in order to effect a
proportional reduction to the Scheduled Reductions of the Commitments such that
following any such partial reduction, each Scheduled Reduction of the
Commitments shall be equal to the product resulting from the multiplication of
an amount equal to such Scheduled Reduction of the Commitments as originally
established under Section 2.2 or subsection 2.3.2, as the case may be, by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the amount of the Commitments
as so reduced and the denominator of which shall be equal to $45,000,000.

2.5 NO SUBSEQUENT INCREASES TO COMMITMENTS. Where under the terms of
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 the Commitment of any Lender has been terminated or

Amounts would not be $100,000 or a whole multiple thereof, such principal amount
shall be increased or reduced by the Agent in its sole discretion to the nearest
whole multiple of $100,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the
first Advance, the Agent shall perform the foregoing functions as expeditiously
as possible upon receipt of the relevant Draw Down Notice, and may, if it has
prior knowledge, perform the foregoing functions prior to and in anticipation of

Advance specified in a Draw Down Notice, subject to the conditions set forth in
Article 10, the Agent shall disburse the funds it shall have received under the
terms of Section 4.4 by crediting such funds to the Borrower's Account. It is
expressly acknowledged and agreed that where prior to crediting such funds to
the Borrower's Account, the Agent receives from the Borrower, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agent, an unconditional and irrevocable direction
of payment instructing the Agent as to how to dispose of such funds, or
alternatively, a particular Draw Down Notice provides such a direction of
payment, the Agent shall comply with such direction of payment and for all
purposes of this Agreement, such funds, irrevocably and conclusively, shall be
deemed to have been disbursed to the Borrower, if they are disposed of in the
manner contemplated in any such direction of payment.

4.6 CREDITS BY OR ON BEHALF OF LENDERS TO CONSTITUTE ADVANCES. The
Borrower hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees with respect to the Borrower's
Account that all deposits and credits made into said account under the terms
hereof by the Agent in its personal capacity as a Lender hereunder or in its
capacity as Agent on behalf of the other Lenders shall constitute Advances by
the Lenders under the terms hereof.

4.7 MAINTENANCE OF LEDGERS BY THE AGENT. The Agent will open and
maintain on its books at the Agent's Office a loan ledger (the "Loan Ledger")

Page 31 of 103

<PAGE>

-19-

Borrower on account of principal of and interest on such Loans and on account
of the Stand-By Fee with respect to the Available Commitments. Any failure of
the Agent to record a transaction on the Loan Ledger in a timely fashion shall
not affect or impair the validity of the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans by and when herein provided. The Agent shall advise the Borrower
and each of the Lenders promptly after the end of each calendar month of the
entries during the previous month and of the aggregate amounts due by the
Borrower to the Lenders hereunder. The obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by the Loan Ledger
maintained by the Agent,it being the intention of the parties hereto that the
obligations of the Borrower with respect to the Loans are to be evidenced only
as stated herein and not by separate promissory notes.

4.8 AUTHORITY TO DEBIT AND CREDIT. The Borrower does hereby expressly
and irrevocably authorize the Agent to effect all the necessary, debits,
deposits and credits with respect to the Borrower's Account, the whole in order
for the Agent to accommodate the Lenders in making Advances and in order to
accommodate the Borrower in making payments to the Lenders and the Agent, the
whole under and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

4.9 SET-OFF AND COMPENSATION BY THE LENDERS AGAINST THE BORROWER'S
ACCOUNT. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted to any Lender
under Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default, the Lenders, through the Agent, are hereby irrevocably
authorized by the Borrower, at any time and from time to time, without notice to
the Borrower, or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly
waived, to effect compensation, to set-off, to appropriate and to apply any and
all deposits and credits in the Borrower's Account and any other Indebtedness at
any time held or owing by such Lenders through the Agent to or for the credit or
account of the Borrower against and on account of the obligations and
liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders under this Agreement or the Security
Documents or any one thereof as herein provided, including, but not limited to,
all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Agreement or the Security Documents or any one thereof, irrespective of whether
or not the Agent shall have made any demand hereunder or shall have declared the
amounts referred to in subsections 15.2.1 and 15.2.2 to be immediately due and
payable as provided in Section 15.2 and although said obligations and
liabilities or any one thereof, shall be contingent and unmatured. With respect
to the said accounts, all deposits and credits made in said accounts shall
permit the Lenders to exercise through the Agent, their rights under this
Section 4.9 notwithstanding the fact that such accounts shall be maintained with
the Agent. For the purposes of the application of this Section 4.9, the
Borrower and the Lenders agree that the benefit of any term applicable to any
deposit, credit, indebtedness, liability or obligation (collectively referred to
in this Section 4.9 as the "Deposit") referred to in this Section 4.9 shall be
lost immediately before the time when the Lenders shall exercise, through the
Agent, their rights under this Section 4.9 in respect of such Deposit.

4.10 FAILURE BY ANY LENDER TO ADVANCE. The failure by any Lender to make
an Advance in accordance with its obligations hereunder shall not relieve the
other Lenders of their several obligations to make an Advance (in accordance
with their respective obligations) equal to their respective Pro Rata Share of
the aggregate amount of any Advance requested by the Borrower, nor shall any
Lender be responsible for the obligations of any other Lender.

4.11 TEMPORARY ADVANCES BY THE AGENT. Without in any way limiting the
generality of the provisions of Section 4.10, unless the Agent shall have
received a written notice from a Lender by 5:00 P.M., New York time, of the
Business Day prior to the date of any requested Advance that such Lender will
not make available to the Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Advance,
the Agent may irrevocably and unconditionally assume that such Lender shall make
such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent on the date of such requested Advance
in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 and the Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If a Lender does not so make available to the Agent its
Pro Rata Share of such Advance and the Agent does make available to the Borrower
such amount, such Lender shall pay such Pro Rata Share to the Agent on demand,
together with interest thereon for each day from and including the date such Pro
Rata Share of such requested Advance was not made available, at a rate per annum
equal to that which the Borrower would have been obliged to pay to such Lender
had the said Lender made available such Pro Rata Share of such requested
Advance. A certificate of the Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any
amount owing under this Section 4.11 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
If such amount is so made available to the Borrower, in the absence of such
notice from such Lender, such payment to the Agent by such Lender shall
constitute such Lender's Advance on the date of such requested Advance for all
purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not so made available to the
Agent, then the Agent shall notify the Borrower of such failure and, without in
any way affecting or otherwise diminishing the obligation of such Lender to pay
such amount to the Agent on demand, on the third Business Day following the date
of such requested Advance, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent such Pro Rata
Share together with interest thereon for each day that the Borrower had the use
of such Pro Rata Share of the requested Advance at a rate per annum equal to
that which the Borrower would have been obliged to pay to such Lender had the
said Lender made available such Pro Rata Share of such requested Advance. Any
such amount advanced by and repaid to the Agent shall not be deemed to be a Loan
hereunder.

Revolving Loan of each Lender which, at any time and from time to time remains

Eurodollar Rate applicable to each relevant Selected Amount of such Lender plus
1.125% and shall be in effect from and including such Rollover Date up to and
including the day preceding the next following Rollover Date.

Page 33 of 103
<PAGE>

-21-

5.2 INTEREST ON A PRIME RATE BASIS. The principal amount of the
Revolving Loan of each Lender which, at any time and from time to time remains
outstanding and upon which the Borrower, under the terms of this Agreement, is
required to pay interest on a Prime Rate Basis shall bear interest, computed
daily, on the daily balance of the said Revolving Loan from the date of its
first Advance or its Conversion Date, as the case may be, up to and including
the day preceding the day of its full repayment (whether under the provisions of
Article 8 or 15, as the case may be), at an annual rate applicable for each such
day equal to the Prime Rate at the close of business on each such day.

5.3 PAYMENT OF INTEREST. The interest payable in accordance with any of
the foregoing provisions and computed as aforesaid on the amount outstanding
from time to time shall be payable in arrears:

5.3.1 in the case of the Prime Rate Loans, on the 26th day of each
month, the first such payment of interest becoming due and payable on the first
Interest Payment Date following the date the first said Advance was made, with
interest on all overdue interest payable at the rate applicable to principal
plus 2.00% during the period in which it remains unpaid, computed daily,
compounded monthly on each Interest Payment Date and payable upon the demand of
the Agent, which demand shall be made at the request of the Majority Lenders;

5.3.2 in the case of the Eurodollar Loans, on the next following
Rollover Date applicable to a Selected Amount or Selected Amounts, with interest
on all overdue interest at an annual rate applicable for each day during the
period in which it remains unpaid equal to the highest rate of interest then
payable under the Eurodollar Loans plus 2.00%, computed daily, compounded
monthly in arrears on the 26th day of each month and payable upon the demand of
the Agent, which demand shall be made at the request of the Majority Lenders.
The calculation of the commencement and the termination of any period under this
subsection 5.3.2 shall be made in conformity with the provisions of paragraphs
1.1.103.1 to 1.1.103.3 inclusively; and

5.3.3 in the case of the Revolving Loans as a whole, on the last
day of the Revolving Period, or, if applicable, of the Term Period.

5.4 ROLLOVERS OF THE EURODOLLAR LOANS. Effective on any Business Day
during the Revolving Period and the Term Period, by written notice to the Agent,
substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule "D", at least three
Banking Days prior to the Conversion Date (which for the purposes of this
Section 5.4 must be a Rollover Date and a Banking Day) the Borrower may request
that the interest payable on the principal amount of the Eurodollar Loan of each
Lender, which is to be rolled over, be calculated in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 5.1 and .3. By so requesting, the Borrower shall elect
that the Eurodollar Rate be determined by the Agent two Banking Days prior to a
Rollover Date with respect to a Selected Amount or Selected Amounts for each
Lender on the basis of a Eurodollar Deposit or Deposits in a principal amount
approximately equal to the Selected Amount or each of the Selected Amounts of
such Lender having a maturity of 30, 60 or 90 days as applicable, after such
Rollover Date. The same procedure as that described above shall be followed
where the Borrower issues a Draw Down Notice and requests an Advance. Where the
Borrower, in connection with a rollover referred to above, has not delivered a
notice to the Agent under the terms of this Section 5.4 by 11:00 A.M., New York
time, three Banking Days

Page 34 of 103

<PAGE>
-22-

prior to the relevant Rollover Date, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
elected to have interest on the affected Selected Amount or Selected Amounts of
each Lender calculated on a Eurodollar Rate Basis determined on the basis of a
Selected Maturity of 30 days.

5.5 LIMITS ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE EURODOLLAR RATE. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted so as to permit
the Borrower, in connection with the determination of the Eurodollar Rate:

5.5.1 to elect a Selected Maturity on any Rollover Date which
would extend beyond the termination of the Revolving Period or, if applicable,
the Term Period; or

5.5.2 with respect to any Selected Maturity, to elect Selected
Amounts which in the aggregate would be for a principal amount of less than
$5,000,000 and whole multiples of $1,000,000; or

5.5.3 to elect otherwise than identical Selected Maturities for
each of the Lenders and Selected Amounts for each Lender corresponding in
principal to the Pro Rata Share of such Lender.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower shall elect
Selected Maturities, with respect to Selected Amounts of not less than each of
the Scheduled Reductions of Commitments, which shall mature on each Scheduled
Commitment Reduction Date.

5.6 FORWARDING OF NOTICES BY AGENT WITH RESPECT TO EURODOLLAR RATE
ROLLOVERS. Upon receipt of any Rollover Notice under the provisions of Section
5.4, the Agent shall deliver a copy thereof to each of the Lenders by 3:00 P.M.,
New York time, of the day it shall have received same provided the Borrower
shall have delivered such Rollover Notice to the Agent by 11:00 A.M., New York
time, of such day. Concurrently with the delivery of such copy of the Rollover
Notice, the Agent shall deliver a notice to each Lender notifying it (y) of its
Pro Rata Share of the Eurodollar Loans which the Borrower requests to be rolled
over rounded up to the nearest $100,000 and (z) of the Selected Amount or the
Selected Amounts for such Lender, rounded up to the nearest $100,000, with
respect to each of the Selected Maturities selected by the Borrower under the
terms of the said Rollover Notice, except that, if the principal amount of such
Selected Amount or Selected Amounts would not be $100,000 or a whole multiple
thereof, such principal amount shall be increased or reduced by the Agent in its
sole discretion to the nearest whole multiple of $100,000. For all purposes of
this Agreement, any Rollover Notice delivered to the Agent after 11:00 A.M., New
York time, on any Banking Day, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the
next following Banking Day.

5.7 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EURODOLLAR RATE AS AT 11:00 A.M., LONDON
TIME. The Eurodollar Rate shall be established as at 11:00 A.M., London time,
two Banking Days prior to the relevant Rollover Date. Before the end of
business, two Banking Days prior to the said Rollover Date, the Agent shall
notify the Borrower and each of the Lenders what shall be the Eurodollar Rate
applicable to each Selected Amount for each Selected Maturity.

5.8 NO REVOCATION OR WITHDRAWAL OF ROLLOVER NOTICES. Any Rollover Notice
once delivered to the Agent, may not subsequently be revoked or withdrawn by the
Borrower.

5.9 INTEREST ON LOANS GENERALLY. Where no specific provision is made in
this Agreement for interest on any outstanding amount which may be payable by
the Borrower under the terms of this Agreement, interest thereon shall be
computed and be payable on a Eurodollar Rate Basis determined on the basis of a
Selected Maturity of 30 days.

5.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND THE STAND-BY FEE. Under the terms of
this Agreement:

5.10.1 interest in respect of the Prime Rate Loans shall be
calculated on the basis of a 365 or, as the case may be, 366 day year for the
actual days elapsed during such period;

5.10.2 interest in respect of Eurodollar Loans shall be calculated
on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed; and

5.10.3 the Stand-By Fee shall be calculated on the basis of a 360
day year for the actual days elapsed.

5.11 STAND-BY FEE. The Borrower hereby covenants and agrees to pay to the
Agent, for the account of each Lender, a Stand-By Fee equal to 0.375% per annum,
computed daily, on the daily balance of the Available Commitment of each such
Lender during the Revolving Period.

5.12 PAYMENT OF THE STAND-BY FEE. The Stand-By Fee payable in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.11 and computed as aforesaid shall be payable
in arrears on the 26th day of each of the months of January, April, July and
October, the first such payment of the Stand-By Fee becoming due and payable on
July 26, 1994. Where at any time during the Revolving Period, the Commitments
are terminated or reduced as contemplated in Section 2.3, as of and on the
effective date of such termination or reduction, the Borrower shall pay the
Stand-By Fee associated with the amount of the Commitments so terminated accrued
to such date.

5.13 ARREARS ON THE STAND-BY FEE. Any arrears on the payment of the
Stand-By Fee shall bear interest, computed daily, on the daily balance thereof
from the date it becomes due up to and including the date preceding the date of
full payment thereof at an annual rate applicable for each such day equal to the
highest rate of interest then payable under the Eurodollar Loans plus 2.5%,
compounded monthly in arrears on the 26th day of each month and payable upon the
demand of the Agent, which demand shall be made at the request of the Majority
Lenders, with interest at the rate applicable to the principal amount of the
Stand-By Fee during the period in which it remains unpaid, computed and payable
as aforesaid. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, where no Eurodollar Loans are outstanding, any
arrears on the payment of the Stand-By Fee shall bear interest as aforesaid at
an annual rate applicable on each such day equal to the Prime Rate at the close
of business on each such day, compounded monthly in arrears on the 26th day of
each month, and payable upon the demand of the Agent, which demand shall be made
at the request of the Majority Lenders, with interest on all overdue interest at
the rate applicable to the principal amount of the Stand-By Fee during the
period in which it remains unpaid, computed and payable as aforesaid.

5.14 INTEREST LIMITATION. Notwithstanding any other term of this
Agreement or any other document referred to herein or therein, the maximum
amount of interest which may be charged to or collected from any Person liable
hereunder shall be absolutely limited to, and shall in no event exceed, the
maximum amount of interest which could lawfully be charged or collected under
applicable law (including, to the extent applicable, the provisions of 5197 of
the Revised Statutes of the United States of America, as amended, 12 U.S.C.
Section 85, as amended), so that the maximum of all amounts constituting
interest under applicable law, howsoever computed, shall never exceed as to any
Person liable therefor such lawful maximum, and any term of this Agreement or
any other document referred to herein or therein which could be construed as
providing for interest in excess of such lawful maximum shall be and hereby is
made expressly subject to and modified by the provisions of this Section.

5.15 COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrower hereby covenants and agrees to pay to
the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, a Commitment Fee equal to 0.75% of
the Commitments as initially established under Section 2.1. The Commitment Fee
shall be payable concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and, except
as expressly provided in Section 5.16, shall under no circumstances be
refundable in whole or in part even if no Advance is ever made under the terms
hereof.

5.16 PARTIAL REFUND OF THE COMMITMENT FEE. Where at any time during a
period of 180 days following the execution of this Agreement, the Borrower
successfully completes either a public issue or a private placement of any
equity instrument, debt instrument convertible into equity or of any pure debt
instrument, in each case under terms and conditions no more onerous than those
contemplated in this Agreement (such placement to be referred to herein as a
"Public or Private Placement") and uses the net proceeds of same to effect an
optional prepayment of the Revolving Loans under Section 8.2 and does
furthermore exercise its rights under subsection 2.3.3 and reduces the
Commitments by an amount equal to such net proceeds, then the Lenders shall
reimburse to the Borrower a portion of the Commitment Fee previously received by
them equal to 0.375% of the amount by which the Borrower so reduced the
Commitments. For the purposes hereof, in determining whether or not the terms
and conditions attaching to any of the foregoing instruments are more onerous
than those contemplated in this Agreement, the following shall be considered as
constituting more onerous terms (v) a maturity which is prior to April 25, 1999,
(w) an aggregate pricing attaching to the instrument which is greater than that
relating to the Commitments and the Revolving Loans, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
where such instrument would bear interest at a fixed rate until maturity, such
rate of interest may be higher than that applicable to the Revolving Loans so
long as it does not exceed the prevailing market rate for such instruments, (x)
covenants which are more restrictive than those contemplated in this Agreement,
(y) defaults and events of default that would permit the holders of such
instruments to accelerate maturity earlier than the Lenders are permitted to do
under the terms hereof or (z) the creation of Liens on any assets of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof or the granting or undertaking by DLFC or any
Subsidiary thereof of any Guarantee Obligation which provides greater benefits
than those contemplated by the Support Agreement.

5.17 AGENCY FEE. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for its account
exclusively, an annual agency fee (to be determined by separate agreement
between the Agent and the Borrower) in advance, (the "Agency Fee") the first
payment becoming due and payable concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement and thereafter, on each successive anniversary of such date until the
later of the date the Commitments are terminated or cancelled and the date that
the Loans are repaid in full. Under no circumstances shall the Agency Fee be
refundable either in whole or in part, even if no Advance is ever made under the
terms hereof.

ARTICLE 6

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCREASED COSTS AND INDEMNITY

6.1 CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. If and each time that the Agent shall
reasonably determine that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant
markets for Dollar deposits generally, adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans or any
part thereof for any Selected Maturity, or the Agent shall receive a notice from
any Affected Lender that:

6.1.1 by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant markets
generally, deposits in Dollars are not available to such Affected Lender in such
market in the ordinary course of business in sufficient amounts to enable it to
make or maintain a Eurodollar Loan, for any Selected Maturity; or

6.1.2 by reason of any change in any Law or any change in exchange
controls or fiscal regulations (whether or not having the force of law) it is
impracticable for such Affected Lender to make or maintain a Eurodollar Loan for
any Selected Maturity; or

6.1.3 the Eurodollar Rate does not represent, by an amount which
the Affected Lender or Lenders deem in their sole discretion to be material, the
effective cost of funding a Eurodollar Loan to be made for any Selected Maturity
or continued for any new Selected Maturity by the Affected Lender;

the Agent shall promptly give notice of such determination by it or of receipt
by it of such notice as the case may be, to the Borrower and each of the
Lenders. Any notice given to the Agent by any Affected Lender under the
provisions of either one of subsections 6.1.2 or 6.1.3, must be accompanied by a
written explanation, and in the case of a notice under subsection 6.1.2 only, as
soon as same becomes available to such Affected Lender, must be accompanied by a
copy of the relevant Law, or of an extract thereof.

6.2 SUSPENSION OF RIGHTS TO CONVERT. If a notice has been given by the
Agent pursuant to Section 6.1:

6.2.1 such new Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall not be made
(whether pursuant to an Advance or a rollover) by the Lenders or an Affected
Lender or Lenders, as the case may be, and the Borrower's right to elect that
Advances be made or maintained as, or once made be rolled over

Page 38 of 103

<PAGE>
-26-

as Eurodollar Loans, by the Lenders or an Affected Lender or Lenders, as the
case may be, shall be suspended until such time as the Agent shall have
concluded or shall have been notified by an Affected Lender that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, whereupon, it
shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of such conclusion or notification as
the case may be; and

6.2.2 each of the Lenders or the Affected Lender or Lenders, as
the case may be, over the course of the next 10 Business Days following the
issuance of the notice by the Agent under Section 6.1, shall negotiate in good
faith with the Borrower and deliver to the Borrower in writing the terms of a
substitute basis for the continuation of the Eurodollar Loans of the Lenders, or
each of the Affected Lender or Lenders, as the case may be, which is,
financially, the substantial equivalent to each of the Lenders or the Affected
Lender or Lenders, as the case may be, of the terms provided herein. The terms
of the Substitute Basis for the Eurodollar Loans shall be effective from the
date agreed to by the Borrower and the Affected Lender or Lenders and the
provisions of this Agreement respecting such Eurodollar Loans shall be amended,
IPSO FACTO, to accord with the terms of the Substitute Basis. The Borrower
shall sign such documents, deeds and instruments and shall do all such things as
each of the Lenders or the Affected Lender or Lenders, as the case may be, shall
consider useful or necessary to give effect to the Substitute Basis. If by the
expiry of the said 10 Business Days no agreement has been reached with respect
to the Substitute Basis, the affected outstanding Eurodollar Loans, if any, will
thereupon and as of the said 10th Business Day, automatically be converted into
Prime Rate Loans and the Borrower shall forthwith upon receipt of a demand
therefor, pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders or the Affected
Lender or Lenders, as the case may be, the amounts referred to in Sections 6.6
and 6.7.

6.3 CHANGE IN LAW. If any Lender shall determine (which determination
shall be evidenced by a certificate submitted to the Agent and the Borrower by
such Lender and shall be final and conclusive upon all the parties hereto absent
manifest error) that w) the entering into force or the putting into effect of
any existing Law, directive, guideline (whether or not having the force of law)
or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
or other authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, x)
the adoption by any Governmental Authority of any Law, directive or guideline
(whether or not having the force of law), y) any change in any Law, directive or
guideline (whether or not having the force of law), or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority or other authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or z) any reversal by any
Governmental Authority or other authority of an interpretation of any Law,
directive or guideline (whether or not having the force of law), has:

6.3.1 made or shall make it unlawful or contrary to any such Law,
directive or guideline for such Lender to maintain or give effect to all or any
part of its obligations as contemplated by this Agreement, or to make or
maintain all or any part of its Prime Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan hereunder,
then, the obligations of such Lender to so maintain or give effect to such part
of such obligations, or to make or maintain such part of such Prime Rate Loan or
Eurodollar Loan shall terminate, and, subject to the provisions of any such Law,
directive or guideline and those of Sections 6.6 and 6.7 with respect to losses,
expenses and costs, the Borrower, to the extent not prohibited by any such
Requirement of Law may convert such Prime Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan, as the
case may be, into the other or may repay the affected Prime Rate Loan

Page 39 of 103

<PAGE>

-27-

or Eurodollar Loan of such Lender in full with accrued interest thereon, which
conversion or repayment shall be made at the expiration of the relevant Selected
Maturity last to expire before the effective date of such adoption, change or
reversal, or, if in the judgment of such Lender immediate conversion or
repayment is required, immediately upon demand of such Lender. Where any such
conversion is prohibited by any such Requirement of Law, then the Borrower shall
repay the affected Prime Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan, as the case may be, of
such Lender in full with accrued interest thereon as contemplated above; or

6.3.2 x) imposed, modified, or deemed applicable any loan ceiling
against such Lender, or imposed, modified or deemed applicable any special tax,
reserve, deposit or similar requirement with respect to assets held by, deposits
in or for the account of, the acquisition of funds by, or loans or commitments
to lend by such Lender, or y) changed the basis of taxation of payments to such
Lender under this Agreement (other than a change affecting taxation on the
overall net income of such Lender), or z) imposed on such Lender any other
condition (including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender as a
result of this Agreement or its Commitment) or monetary restraint with respect
to this Agreement (including without limitation with respect to the Stand-by
Fee), the Prime Rate Loan or the Eurodollar Loan, by such Lender, or any other
document, instrument or transaction contemplated hereby, and the result of any
of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining
its Commitment or any of its Prime Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan, as the case may
be, or to reduce any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder with respect to
the Stand-by Fee or the Commitment Fee or with respect to an Prime Rate Loan or
a Eurodollar Loan, as the case may be, by an amount which such Lender deems to
be material, the Borrower, within 10 Business Days of receipt of the certificate
referred to above:

6.3.2.1 shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts computed by such Lender as will, on an after-tax basis, compensate such
Lender for such additional costs or reduction in amounts receivable; and

6.3.2.2 subject to the provisions of Sections 6.6 and 6.7 with
respect to losses, expenses and costs, to the extent not prohibited by any such
Requirement of Law, may convert such Prime Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan, as the
case may be, of such Lender into the other or may repay the affected Prime Rate
Loan or Eurodollar Loan, as the case may be, of such Lender in full with accrued
interest thereon. Where any such conversion is prohibited by any such
Requirement of Law, then the Borrower shall repay the affected Prime Rate Loan
or Eurodollar Loan, as the case may be, of such Lender in full with accrued
interest thereon as contemplated above.

6.4 OPTION TO REPLACE LENDERS. If any Lender shall become an Affected
Lender, or if any Lender shall fail to make an Advance in accordance with its
obligations hereunder, (in such latter case, such Lender, in this Section 6.4
shall be referred to as a "defaulting Lender") then, in each such case, provided
there does not then exist any Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may
request one or more Replacement Lenders to take over all or the affected portion
of such Lender's then outstanding Loans and to assume all or the affected
portion of such Lender's Commitment and obligations hereunder. If one or more
Replacement Lenders shall so agree, and if the Agent shall have consented in
writing to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),

Page 40 of 103

<PAGE>
-28-

the Loans and Commitment of such Affected Lender or defaulting Lender, as the
case may be, may, at the direction of the Borrower, be automatically assigned to
such Replacement Lenders in accordance with subsection 18.9.1, in such amounts
as the Borrower may designate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to any such
assignment, the Borrower shall have paid to the Affected Lender or defaulting
Lender, as the case may be, all amounts owing to it under Sections 6.2, 6.3,
6.6, 6.7 and Article 7.

6.5 NOTICE TO OTHER LENDERS. The Agent shall promptly give notice of
receipt by it of any notice delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Article
6 to each of the other Lenders and the Borrower.

6.6 REIMBURSEMENT OF LOSSES, ETC. Whenever any Lender or the Agent shall
sustain or incur any losses, out-of-pocket expenses, funding expenses or any
other costs in connection with:

6.6.1 the failure of the Borrower to borrow pursuant to a Draw
Down Notice issued under the provisions of Article 4 or the failure to rollover
pursuant to a Rollover Notice issued under the provisions of Article 5 (in each
case whether by reason of the Borrower's determination not to proceed, the non-
fulfilment of any of the conditions imposed on the Borrower set forth in this
Agreement or otherwise); or

6.6.2 the declaration that the Agent is required to make under
Section 15.2 requiring payment upon acceleration; or

6.6.3 conversions pursuant to Section 6.2; or

6.6.4 conversions or payments pursuant to Section 6.3; or

6.6.5 assignments to Replacement Lenders as contemplated in
Section 6.4; or

6.6.6 any payment, repayment, optional prepayment or mandatory
prepayment referred to in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 and subsection 8.4;

the Borrower agrees to pay such Lender or the Agent, upon demand, an amount
certified by such Lender or the Agent to be sufficient to compensate such Lender
or the Agent for all such losses, expenses and costs. The agreements of the
Borrower with respect to Sections 6.6 and 6.7 shall survive the repayment of the
Loans and the termination of this Agreement.

6.7 AMOUNT OF LOSSES, ETC. The losses, expenses and costs referred to in
Section 6.6 shall include, but not be limited to losses, expenses and costs
incurred by a Lender in connection with the redeployment of funds converted,
repaid, prepaid, not borrowed or not paid or prepaid, as the case may be, in an
amount equal to the premium, if any, that such Lender would be required to pay
were it to purchase, in the relevant market, prior to its maturity, on the date
of such conversion, repayment, prepayment, failure to borrow or failure to repay
or prepay, as the case may be, a term deposit instrument in a principal amount
equal to the affected Selected Amount and whose maturity is equal to the
remaining term of the affected Selected Maturity, and bearing interest at a rate
equal to the rate applicable or that would have been applicable under the terms
hereof to the funds

Page 41 of 103

<PAGE>
-29-

converted, repaid, prepaid, not borrowed, not paid or not prepaid, as the case
may be, on the date of such conversion, repayment, prepayment, failure to borrow
or failure to repay or prepay, as the case may be. The Agent or the Lender
making a claim under the provisions of Sections 6.6 and 6.7, as promptly as
practicable, shall provide to the Borrower a statement, supported where
applicable by documentary evidence, explaining in reasonable detail the amount
of any such loss, expenses or cost, which statement shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive with respect to the parties hereto.

6.8 LENDERS TO AVOID CREATING ADDITIONAL LIABILITY FOR THE
BORROWER. Each Lender agrees to use its best efforts to avoid incurring any
liability for which the Borrower is required to indemnify such Lender pursuant
to this Article 6 which best efforts shall include the transfer of the Loan of
such Lender to another office, branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender.
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall require such Lender to take any
action which would cause such Lender or such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to
incur any additional cost or expense, or which would reduce any amount to be
received by such Lender or such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof by an amount
which such Lender deems to be material or which would require such Lender or
such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to take any action which such Lender
determines in its sole judgment to be inadvisable for regulatory, competitive or
internal management reasons; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Borrower shall
reimburse such Lender or such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof for any such
additional cost incurred by such Lender in taking any action pursuant to this
Section 6.8.

ARTICLE 7

TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES

7.1 PAYMENTS WITHOUT DEDUCTIONS. The Borrower agrees to pay the Loans of
each Lender, in principal, interest, fees and accessories, free and clear of and
without deduction or withholding for (y) any and all present and future taxes
(including stamp taxes), levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings,
duties, fees, interest, fines or penalties, but excluding however, taxes imposed
upon such Lender (any such Lender shall be referred to herein as a "Taxed
Lender") by the jurisdiction and political subdivision in which it may be
located or under the Laws of which it may have been constituted that may be
imposed from time to time either by the jurisdiction from which payment is made
or in connection with any amount required to be paid to such Taxed Lender
pursuant to this Agreement or by any jurisdiction with respect to the
preparation, execution, delivery, registration, performance, amendment or
enforcement of this Agreement (all of the foregoing, other than the excluded
items shall be collectively referred to herein as the "Local Taxes"), and (z)
any and all present and future taxes (including stamp taxes), levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings, duties, fees, interest, fines or penalties
that may be imposed from time to time by any jurisdiction with respect to the
payment by the Borrower of or the reimbursement by the Borrower for any Local
Taxes (all of the foregoing listed in clauses (y) and (z), other than the
excluded items, shall be collectively referred to herein as the "Taxes"). In
the event that any Taxed Lender shall have paid any Taxes, which under the terms
of this Section 7.1, the Borrower is obliged to pay, the Borrower, upon demand
shall reimburse such Taxed Lender the

Page 42 of 103

<PAGE>
-30-

amount of any such Taxes so paid by the latter, with interest on such amount, as
contemplated in this Agreement.

7.2 PAYMENTS OF ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS. If the Borrower is at any time
required by Law to make any deduction or withholding in respect of any Taxes
from any amount payable under this Agreement or is prevented by operation of Law
from paying, causing to be paid or reimbursing the payment of any Taxes, the
Borrower agrees to pay such additional amount as may be necessary in order that
the net amounts received by any Taxed Lender or Lenders, after such deduction or
withholding and after the deduction of any such Taxes not paid, caused to be
paid or reimbursed by the Borrower, shall equal the amounts which would have
been realized by such Taxed Lender or Lenders, if such deduction or withholding
had not been made and if such Taxes had been paid, caused to be paid or
reimbursed by the Borrower. Such additional amounts shall be paid (y) in the
case of amounts payable as a result of a deduction or withholding from an amount
payable under this Agreement, on the date the latter amount is payable and (z)
in the case of an amount payable as a result of the failure by the Borrower to
pay or reimburse such Taxes, on the earlier of the date on which such Taxes are
due and the fifth day following the receipt by the Borrower of a notice from the
Taxed Lender that such Taxes have been paid by such Taxed Lender.

7.3 INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. If the Borrower is prevented by
operation of Law from paying or causing to be paid any amount required to be
paid by Section 7.2, the Borrower agrees to pay as additional interest payable
under this Agreement an amount equal to such required amount, on the applicable
Interest Payment Date if such amount is in respect of interest or, if otherwise,
on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. The Borrower, at the request of
any Taxed Lender shall sign such documents, deeds and instruments and shall do
all such things as such Taxed Lender shall consider useful or necessary to give
full force and effect to such increase in the rate of interest.

7.4 REMITTANCES BY TAXED LENDER. With respect to any of such Taxes, the
Borrower shall make any required payment thereof within the time allowed under
Law and, within 30 days thereafter, shall furnish to any Taxed Lender such
certificates, receipts and other documents as may be available to establish any
tax credit to which such Lender may be entitled. If such Taxed Lender shall
determine that it has irrevocably obtained a credit or similar tax benefit with
respect to income taxes imposed by a jurisdiction in which it may be located or
under the Laws of which it has been constituted, on the basis of the payment of
such Taxes by the Borrower, such Taxed Lender, shall remit to the Borrower
promptly an amount equal to the amount of such credit or benefit as is, in its
discretion, exercised in good faith, equitably allocable to such payment by the
Borrower having taken into account all its dealings giving rise to similar
credits or benefits in relation to the same tax period. If such Taxed Lender
shall determine subsequently that, for any reason, the amount of such credit or
benefit has directly or indirectly been reduced, the Borrower, upon the request
of such Taxed Lender accompanied by evidence of such reduction, shall pay to
such Taxed Lender an amount equal to the amount of such reduction. All
determinations and computations required or permitted by this Section 7.4 shall
be made, and all assumptions, methods of allocation and other principles
necessary for or related to such determinations and computations shall be made
or selected, by such Taxed Lender in its sole discretion and shall constitute
PRIMA FACIE evidence of the amounts or matters so determined or computed.

7.5 LENDERS TO AVOID CREATING ADDITIONAL LIABILITY FOR THE
BORROWER. Each Lender agrees to use its best efforts to avoid incurring any
liability for which the Borrower is required to indemnify such Lender pursuant
to this Article 7 which best efforts shall include the transfer of the Loan of
such Lender to another office, branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender.
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall require such Lender to take any
action which would cause such Lender or such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to
incur any additional cost or expense, or which would reduce any amount to be
received by such Lender or such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, by an amount
which such Lender deems to be material or which would require such Lender or
such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to take any action which such Lender
determines in its sole judgment to be inadvisable for regulatory, competitive or
internal management reasons; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Borrower shall
reimburse such Lender or such Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof for any such
additional cost incurred by such Lender in taking any action pursuant to this
Section 7.5.

7.6 SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENTS. The agreements of the Borrower under this
Article 7 shall survive the repayments of the Loans and the termination of this
Agreement.

ARTICLE 8

PAYMENTS, REPAYMENTS AND OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS

8.1 REPAYMENT OF REVOLVING LOANS. Where on the effective date of any
reduction to the Commitments, pursuant to any one of Sections 2.2 or 2.3, the
Revolving Loans exceed the Commitments once reduced as at such date, then the
Borrower hereby binds and obliges itself to repay on such effective date of any
such reduction, such portion of the Revolving Loans as would reduce said excess
to nil, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that where such payment is required to be made on a
day which is not a Rollover Date with respect to the Eurodollar Loans being
repaid, concurrently with any such payment, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent,
for the account of the Lenders, any losses, expenses and costs incurred or to be
incurred by the Lenders in connection with such payment and referred to in
Sections 6.6 and 6.7, together, in all cases, with any accrued and unpaid
interest on any amount to be so repaid. Without in any way limiting the
generality of any of the foregoing, the Borrower shall repay the entire
principal amount of the Revolving Loans on the last day of the Revolving Period,
unless the Revolving Period has terminated as a consequence of the termination
of the Support Agreement, in which case, the Borrower shall repay the entire
principal amount of the Revolving Loan on the last day of the Term Period.

8.2 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT OF THE REVOLVING LOANS. During the Revolving
Period and the Term Period, upon giving the Agent a notice prior to the proposed
prepayment, the Borrower may, on any Business Day, voluntarily prepay without
penalty or premium, the whole or a part of the principal amount of the Revolving
Loans, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that where such optional prepayment is made on any day
which is not a Rollover Date with respect to the principal amount of such
Revolving Loans being so prepaid, concurrently with any such optional

11.20 PRIORITY OF LIEN. The Liens created, evidenced or constituted by the
Pledge Agreement are valid and are subject to no Liens that are prior to, on a
parity with or junior thereto and are enforceable as security for the
obligations secured thereby against the Borrower and all third parties.

11.21 APPROVALS. Except for any of such Approvals which, if not obtained
or if not in full force and effect, would not singly or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect, all approvals, certificates of authorization, consents,
permits, orders, registrations, declarations, filings, notices and other actions
to be taken in respect of any federal, state, provincial or local Governmental
Authority (the "Approvals"), which are necessary for the ownership and operation
by each one of DLFC, the Borrower and the Material Subsidiaries of the Borrower
of its business and all of the properties related thereto, have been duly
obtained, made or taken and are in full force and effect, are not subject to
further approval or appeal, or any pending or threatened legal or administrative
proceedings, and the Borrower has no knowledge of any facts which, as a matter
of Law, are sufficient to justify the commencement by any Governmental Authority
of any proceeding for the termination or revocation of such Approvals.

11.22 U.S. FEDERAL REGULATIONS. No part of the proceeds of the Revolving
Loans hereunder will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock"
within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of
the Board as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose
which violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board. If requested by
the Agent, the Borrower will furnish to each Lender a statement to the foregoing
effect in conformity with the requirements of Federal Reserve Form U-1 referred
to in said Regulation U.

11.23 ERISA. No Reportable Event has occurred during the immediately
preceding six-year period with respect to any Plan which, if such Plan then
terminated, could have a Material Adverse Effect, and each Plan has complied and
has been administered in all material respects with applicable provisions of
ERISA and the Code. The present value of all benefits under each Single
Employer Plan maintained by the Borrower or any Commonly Controlled Entity
(based on those assumptions used to fund such Plan) did not, as of the end of
the last Plan year applicable thereto, exceed the value of the assets of such
Plan allocable to such Benefits by an amount which could have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as disclosed pursuant to Section 13.6, neither the Borrower nor
any Commonly Controlled Entity has during the immediately preceding six-year
period had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan which
would have a Material Adverse Effect, and the liability to which the Borrower or
any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject under ERISA if the Borrower
or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all
Multiemployer Plans as the most recent valuation date applicable thereto could
not have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly
Controlled Entity has received notice that any Multiemployer Plan is in
Reorganization or Insolvent nor, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, is any
such Reorganization or Insolvency reasonably likely to occur.

11.24 ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION. All information, reports
and other papers and data relating to the Borrower, and any Material Subsidiary
of the Borrower, furnished to any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
of the said Persons, as the case may be, were, at the time the same were so
furnished, taken as a whole, complete and correct in all material respects to
the extent necessary to give such Lender a true and accurate knowledge of the
subject matter. No fact is currently known to the Borrower which has or may
have a Material Adverse Effect which has not been set forth or referred to
herein or in such information, reports and other papers and data or otherwise
specifically disclosed in writing to the Lenders.

11.25 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All statements contained
in any certificate, financial statement, legal opinion or other document
delivered to the Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower, including
or pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, the Security Documents or
any other documents contemplated by any thereof or any amendments to any
thereof, or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, shall constitute representations and warranties made under this
Agreement. All representations and warranties made under this Agreement, other
than those made under or in connection with Sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4
and other than those the incorrectness of which individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Effect shall be deemed to be made and shall
be true and correct, in all material aspects, at and as of the date of this
Agreement, at and as of the date of any Advance hereunder and so long as any
Loan or other amount payable hereunder is outstanding and unpaid. The
representations and warranties made under or in connection with Sections 11.1,
11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 shall be true and correct, in all material respects, at and
as of the date of this Agreement. All representations and warranties made under
this Agreement shall survive, and not be waived, by the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, any investigation by or on behalf of the Agent or any Lender
or the making of any Loan under this Agreement.

existence and preserve and maintain all rights, franchises, licenses and
privileges necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of its business, and

which the character of its properties or the nature of its business requires
such qualification or authorization and where the failure to so preserve and
maintain said rights, franchises, licences and privileges or where the failure
to qualify, as the case may be, would singly or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. So long as the Borrower shall be entitled to borrow
hereunder, the Borrower shall maintain, and take all actions necessary to
maintain, in full force and effect the action taken by the Borrower to authorize
the borrowings hereunder and the execution, delivery and performance in
accordance with their respective terms of this Agreement, and any other

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and notify the Agent of any change
in the incumbency of Persons authorized by the Borrower to sign documents as

any subsequent notice with respect thereto continue to be correct unless and
until the Borrower shall have notified the Agent in writing of any change in the
facts stated therein).

12.2 OBTAIN AUTHORIZATIONS. From time to time, obtain and maintain or

proper and efficient manner so as to preserve and protect the earnings, incomes
and profits therefrom and keep or cause to be kept, proper and lawful records
and books of account and make or cause to be made therein, true and faithful
entries of all dealings and transactions in relation to its business, all in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis and comply with all
Requirements of Law and the terms and conditions of all permits, licenses,
certificates and Approvals, non-compliance with which would, singly or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing
herein shall require the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries to comply
with any Requirement of Law or the terms or conditions of any permit, license,
certificate or Approval so long as the applicability or validity

Page 57 of 103

and so long as non-compliance while so contesting shall not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

good repair, working order and condition all properties used or useful in its

assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its
income, capital or profits or upon any properties belonging to it prior to the
date on which penalties attach thereto, and all lawful claims for rents, labour,

of its properties, provided, however, that such tax, assessment, charge, levy or
claim which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings need not
be paid if appropriate reserves shall have been set aside on the appropriate
books, and only for so long as such tax, assessment, charge, levy, claim or
quarterly instalment does not become a Lien or charge other than a Permitted
Encumbrance and no foreclosure, distraint, seizure, attachment, sale or similar
proceedings shall have been commenced.

12.7 VISITS AND INSPECTIONS. Permit representatives of any of the Lenders
to visit and inspect its properties during normal business hours, inspect and
make extracts from and copies of its books and records and discuss with its
principal officers its business, assets, liabilities, financial position,
results of operations and business prospects.

12.8 PAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS. Pay any and all of its Indebtedness the
amount of which exceeds singly or in the aggregate $1,000,000 when and as the
same becomes due, save and except for such Indebtedness unless it or others on
its behalf are contesting diligently and in good faith its obligation to pay and
for which it has provided the Lenders with security reasonable to the Majority
Lenders, in an amount sufficient to pay in principal, interest and costs, such
Indebtedness, should such contestation be unsuccessful. The provisions of this
Section 12.8 shall pertain only to the Borrower.

Reorganization of, a Multiemployer Plan; or

15.1.6.6 any other event or condition occur or exist, with
respect to a Single Employer Plan or a Multiemployer Plan;

and in each case in paragraphs 15.1.6.1 through 15.1.6.6 above, such event or
condition, together with all other such events or conditions, if any, could
subject the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries to any tax, penalty or
other liabilities in the aggregate material in relation to the

Page 65 of 103

<PAGE>

-53-

business, operations, property or financial or other condition of the Borrower
and its Material Subsidiaries taken as a whole and such Default shall not have
been remedied within 60 days following the issuance by the Agent of a notice
thereof; or

15.1.7 should a judgment or decree (other than a consent decree
entered into under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of the United States of America with which the Borrower or its
Material Subsidiaries, as the case may be, are complying) be entered against
either the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Material Subsidiaries involving in
the aggregate a liability (net of the amount of any liability covered by
Eligible Reinsurers) of $1,000,000 or more and such judgment or decree not have
been vacated, discharged, stayed or bonded pending appeal within 30 days from
the entry thereof. For the purposes of this subsection 15.1.7, "Eligible
Reinsurers" shall mean, as at any time, a group of reinsurers who have been
granted a rating category of B or higher in the latest edition of Best's
Insurance Reports, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that where any such reinsurer is, at any
time, in a state of receivership or where any superintending or regulatory
authority of any jurisdiction having authority over such reinsurer, has
intervened in the management of such reinsurer, then, for all purposes of the
definition of an "Eligible Reinsurer", as of and from such time, such reinsurer
shall be excluded from such definition; or

15.1.8 should either one of the Borrower or DLFC default with
respect to any of its Indebtedness (other than the Indebtedness of the Borrower,
under this Agreement and the Security Documents) which singly or in the
aggregate exceeds $1,000,000 in the case of the Borrower or $10,000,000 in the
case of DLFC, unless said Person or others on their behalf are contesting
diligently and in good faith their, or either one thereof, obligation to pay and
for which they, or either one thereof have provided the Lenders with security
reasonable to the Majority Lenders, in an amount sufficient to pay in principal,
interest and costs, such Indebtedness, should such contestation be unsuccessful;
or

15.1.9 should DLFC fail at any time to maintain the entire legal
title to or beneficial interest in at least 51% of the shares of stock of the
Borrower, outstanding from time to time, having power under ordinary
circumstances to vote for the election of members of the board of directors of
the Borrower.

15.2 REMEDIES. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and in every such event, the Agent, at the request of the Majority
Lenders, shall declare as being immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding:

15.2.1 the entire amount of the Loans then outstanding in principal
and interest; and

15.2.2 an amount equal to the amount of the losses, expenses and
costs incurred by the Lenders and referred to in Sections 6.6 and 6.7; and

each of the Commitments shall thereupon, at the discretion of the Majority
Lenders, forthwith terminate and be cancelled and thereupon the Lenders may
exercise any and all of their rights and recourses under this Agreement and any
of the Security Documents.

15.3 PROCEEDS OF REALIZATION. Subject to the provisions of Section 18.5,
the proceeds of realization under any of the Security Documents or any credit or
compensating balances of the Borrower held by the Agent, as agent for the
Lenders, or by any of the Lenders shall be applied as follows:

15.3.1 firstly, to pay or reimburse in full all costs, charges and
expenses incurred and outstanding in connection with such realization, as
established by the Majority Lenders; and

15.3.2 secondly, to pay or reimburse in full the outstanding Loans
and the Borrower Obligations.

15.4 APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. Subject only to the provisions of Sections
15.3 and 18.5, the Lenders shall apply the proceeds of realization and of any
credit or compensating balances therein referred to against such part of the
Indebtedness of the Borrower under this Agreement as the Majority Lenders deem
best.

15.5 CALCULATION OF PRO RATA PORTIONS. The costs, charges and expenses,
as well as the proceeds of realization and the credit and compensating balances
referred to in Section 15.3, shall be shared by each Lender on the basis of its
respective Pro Rata Share.

15.6 NOTICES. Save as otherwise expressly provided for herein, no notice
of any kind shall be required to be given to the Borrower or DLFC by the Agent
or the Lenders for the purpose of putting the Borrower or DLFC in default, said
party being in default by the mere lapse of time allowed for the performance of
an obligation or by the mere happening of an event constituting an Event of
Default.

15.7 DEALINGS WITH THE BORROWER AND DLFC. The Agent, upon the request of
the Majority Lenders, may grant extensions of time and other indulgences, and
subject to Section 18.2, take and give up security, accept compositions, grant
releases and discharges and otherwise deal with DLFC and the Borrower as the
Majority Lenders may see fit without prejudice to the liability of the Borrower
or of DLFC or to the Lenders' rights in respect of the security conferred upon
them under the terms hereof.

ARTICLE 4.

THE AGENT

16.1 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION. Each Lender hereby irrevocably
appoints and authorizes, and hereby agrees that it will require any transferee

the Agent to take such actions as agent on its behalf and to exercise such
powers hereunder and under the Security Documents as are delegated to the Agent
by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably

herewith or therewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or wilful
misconduct.

16.2 INTEREST HOLDERS. The Agent may treat each Lender, or the Person
designated in the last notice filed with it under this Article, as the holder of
all of the interests of such Lender in its Loan and in its Commitment until
written notice of transfer, signed by such Lender (or the Person designated in
the last notice filed with the Agent) and by the Person designated in such
notice of transfer and in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, shall
have been filed with the Agent.

16.3 CONSULTATION WITH COUNSEL. The Agent may consult with legal counsel
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in
good faith in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.

16.4 DOCUMENTS. The Agent shall not be under any duty to examine into or
pass upon the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any of the Security
Documents, this Agreement or any instrument, document or communication furnished
pursuant thereto or hereto in connection herewith or therewith, and the Agent

been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what they purport to be.

16.5 OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH DLFC, THE BORROWER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. With respect to its Commitment and the Loan made
and to be made from time to time by the Agent in its personal capacity as a
Lender hereunder, it shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any

Agent and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to and generally engage in any kind of business with DLFC, the Borrower and
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and Persons doing business with
any of the said Persons, as if it were not the Agent and without any obligation
to account therefor.

16.6 RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AGENT. The duties and obligations of the Agent
under this Agreement and the Security Documents are only those expressly set
forth herein and therein. The Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the Agent has actual
knowledge, or has been notified by the Borrower of such fact, or has been
notified by a Lender that such Lender considers that a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing (specifying in detail the nature
thereof). The Agent shall not have any duty to investigate whether a Default or
an Event of Default has occurred.

16.7 ACTION BY AGENT. The Agent shall:

16.7.1 be entitled to use its discretion with respect to exercising
or refraining from exercising any rights which may be vested in it by, and with
respect to taking or refraining from taking any action or actions which it may
be able to take under or in respect of, this Agreement, unless the Agent shall
have been instructed by the Majority Lenders to exercise such rights or to take
or refrain from taking such action, provided that the Agent shall not exercise
any rights under Article 15 of this Agreement or under the Security Document,
without the request of the Majority Lenders. The Agent shall incur no liability
under or in respect of this Agreement or any of the Security Documents, with
respect to anything which it may do or refrain from doing in the

performance of any function it is required to perform under any one of Articles
4, 5, 6, 8 or 15) or which may seem to it to be necessary or desirable in the
circumstances, except for its gross negligence or wilful misconduct; and

16.7.2 in all cases be fully protected in acting or refraining from

the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant to such instructions shall be binding on all Lenders.

16.8 NOTICES OF EVENTS OF DEFAULT. In the event that the Agent shall
acquire actual knowledge, or shall have been notified, of any Default or Event
of Default, the Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and shall take such
action and assert such rights under this Agreement or any of the Security
Documents, as the Majority Lenders shall request in writing, and the Agent shall
not be subject to any liability by reason of its acting pursuant to any such
request. If the Majority Lenders shall fail for five days after receipt of the
notice of any Default or Event of Default to request the Agent to take action or
to assert rights under this Agreement or any of the Security Documents, in
respect of such Default or Event of Default, the Agent may, but shall not be
required to, take such action and assert such rights (other than rights under
Article 15 hereof) as it deems in its discretion to be advisable for the
protection of the Lenders.

16.9 RESPONSIBILITY DISCLAIMED. The Agent shall not be under any

of any failure or delay in performance by, or any breach by, any Lender of any
of its obligations under this Agreement;

warranties in this Agreement, the Security Documents or any other document
contemplated thereby or any information provided pursuant to this Agreement or
any of the Security Documents or any other document contemplated thereby or for
the validity, effectiveness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement,
the Security Documents or any other document contemplated thereby.

16.10 INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the
extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Share, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of its
functions as Agent under this Agreement, the Security Documents or any other
document contemplated hereby or thereby, or any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Agent under this Agreement, the Security Documents or any other
document contemplated hereby or thereby, except that no Lender shall be liable

that:

16.11.1 in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
make its Loan it has independently taken whatever steps it considers necessary
to evaluate the financial condition and affairs of DLFC, the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries of the Borrower and that it has made an independent credit judgment
without reliance upon any information furnished by or through the Agent; and

16.11.2 so long as any portion of its Loan remains outstanding, it
will continue to make its own independent evaluation of the financial condition
and affairs of DLFC, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries of the Borrower.

16.12 SUCCESSOR AGENT. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Agent and may be removed at any
time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation
or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent (which shall be one of the Lenders, unless none of the Lenders which is
qualified wishes to accept such appointment and which must be approved by the
Borrower). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank which has an office in
New York City with a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000 and
which must be approved by the Borrower. Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, duties and
obligations of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent.

16.13 AGENT TO DELIVER COPIES. Upon receipt of any information, report,
statement and other paper and data furnished to the Agent under the terms hereof
by or on behalf of the Borrower, the Agent shall promptly communicate and

ARTICLE 17

JUDGMENT CURRENCY

17.1 JUDGMENT CURRENCY. If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing
judgment in any court or for any other purpose hereunder, it is necessary to
convert an amount due, advanced or to be advanced hereunder in the currency in
which it is due, advanced or to be advanced (the "Original Currency") into
another currency (the "Second Currency"), the rate of exchange applied shall be
that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Agent could
purchase, in the United States money market the Original Currency with the
Second Currency on the Business Day on which judgment is given, the amount is
due or advanced or is to be advanced, as the case may be. The Borrower agrees
that its obligations, in respect of any amounts due from it to the Lenders in
the Original Currency hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment expressed or
payment made in the Second Currency, be discharged only to the extent that, on
the Business Day following receipt of any sums so paid or adjudged to be due
hereunder in the Second Currency, the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders may, in
accordance with normal banking procedure, purchase, in the United States money
market, the Original Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so paid or
so adjudged to be due; and if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased
is less than the amount originally due in the Original Currency, the Borrower
agrees as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such payment or judgment
to indemnify the Lenders concerned against such loss.

18.2 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The rights and remedies of the Lenders under
this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which they would otherwise have, and no failure or delay by the Agent or the
Lenders in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude its other or further
exercise or the exercise of any other power or right. Subject to the provisions
of subsections 18.2.1 and 18.2.2 with respect in each case to amendments only,
any term, covenant, agreement or condition contained in this Agreement may be
amended with the consent of the Borrower and the Majority Lenders, and such
amendment shall be binding upon all of the parties hereto, or compliance
therewith may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either
retroactively or prospectively) by the Majority Lenders, and such waiver shall
be binding upon all of the Lenders, and in any such event the failure to
observe, perform or discharge any covenant, condition or obligation waived or
amended (whether such amendment is executed or such consent or waiver is given
before or after such failure) shall not be construed as a breach of such
covenant, condition or obligation or an Event of Default. Without the prior
written consent of:

18.2.1 all of the Lenders, no amendment shall, except as otherwise
expressly permitted hereunder:

18.2.1.1 affect the aggregate amount of the Commitments or the
amount of the Commitment of any Lender, save and except with respect to any
modification to the Commitment of any Lender resulting from the operation of the
provisions of subsection 18.9.1, in which case, only the consent of the parties
involved in such operation shall be required to effect such modification;

18.2.1.2 alter the agreed time for the payment of the principal
of or interest on the Loans or the amount of principal thereof or decrease the
rate of interest thereon;

18.2.1.3 permit any subordination of the principal of or
interest on any Loans;

18.2.1.4 decrease the amount of any fees to be paid to any
Lender;

18.2.1.5 change the percentage of the Lenders required to

Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any of the Security
Documents, including, without limitation, the specific reference to Lenders in
certain provisions and to Majority Lenders in other provisions, should be
construed or interpreted as in any way limiting or restricting the generality of
the provisions of this Section 18.2. The parties hereto agree that any waiver
referred to in this Section 18.2, once issued to the Borrower in writing by the
Agent, purporting to act on behalf of the Majority Lenders or all of the
Lenders, as the case may be, shall be binding on all of the parties.

18.3 CALCULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS TO BE CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING. In the
absence of manifest error, any calculation or determination to be made under the
terms of this Agreement by the Agent or the Majority Lenders, when made, shall
be conclusive and binding on all the parties.

18.4 COMPENSATION AND SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized by the
Borrower, at any time or from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower
or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, subject
to the provisions of Section 18.5, to effect compensation, to set-off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of
deposit, in each case whether matured or unmatured) and any other indebtedness
at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of
the Borrower against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of the
Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all
claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Agreement, irrespective of whether or not the Agent shall have made any demand
hereunder or shall have declared the amounts referred to in subsections 15.2.1
and 15.2.2 to be due and payable as permitted by Section 15.2 and although said
obligations and liabilities or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured.
For the purposes of the application of this Section 18.4, the Borrower and the
Lenders agree that the benefit of any term applicable to any Lender's deposit,
credit, indebtedness, liability or obligation (collectively referred to in this
Section 18.4 as the "Deposit") referred to in this Section 18.4 shall be lost
immediately before the time when such Lender shall exercise its rights under
this Section 18.4 in respect of a relevant Deposit of such Lender. Subsequent
to the exercise of rights under this Section 18.4, the Lender or Lenders having
exercised same shall notify the Borrower of such exercise.

18.5 RECOVERY FOR LENDERS. Each Lender agrees that if it shall exercise
any right under Section 18.4 or any other right of counterclaim, compensation,
set-off, banker's lien, realization of security, or similar right with respect
to property of the Borrower, or if under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar Law, it receives a secured claim the security for which is a
debt owed by it to the Borrower, the amount thereof shall constitute proceeds of
realization under Section 15.3 and shall be dealt with in the same manner as
therein provided as if a realization had occurred. All amounts thus recovered
by any Lender shall promptly be delivered to the Agent under Section 8.6 for
distribution.

18.6 NO DEEMED PAYMENT. Where any Lender, whether under the provisions of
this Agreement or otherwise, receives or recovers from the Borrower an amount
greater than the amount ultimately payable to it under the provisions of this
Agreement, but as a consequence of the provisions of Section 18.5 does not
retain the totality of such amount, as between the Borrower on the one hand and
that Lender, on the other hand, that excess amount not retained by such Lender
shall be treated as not having been paid to such Lender for the purposes of this
Agreement.

18.7 ASSIGNMENTS BY THE BORROWER. The rights of the Borrower hereunder
are declared to be purely personal and may therefore not be assigned or
transferred, nor can the Borrower assign or transfer any of its obligations, any
such assignment being null and void insofar as the Lenders are concerned and
rendering any balance then outstanding of amounts referred to in Section 15.2
immediately due and payable at the option of the Majority Lenders, and relieving
the Lenders from the obligation of making any or any further Advances hereunder.

18.8 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES AND TAXES. The Borrower agrees to pay or
reimburse the Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and
any amendment, supplement or modification to this Agreement and the Security
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including, without limitation, the reasonable syndication and legal
costs incurred by the Agent. The Borrower agrees (w) to pay or reimburse each
Lender and the Agent for all their costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any advice sought by the Agent or the Lenders on the construction of the

rights and recourses under the present Agreement and the Security Documents, (x)
to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Agent for all their costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any right under
this Agreement and the Security Documents including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agent and to the several
Lenders, (y) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Agent harmless from
any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect
to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if
any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
execution and delivery of, or consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver
or consent under or in respect of this Agreement, the Security Documents and any
such other documents, and (z) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the
Agent in its capacity as such harmless from and against any and all other
liabilities, obligations, losses (subject to Sections 6.6 and 6.7 in the case of
any Lender in respect of any losses, expenses or costs governed by such
Sections), damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution,
delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"indemnified liabilities"), PROVIDED that the Borrower shall have no obligation
hereunder to the Agent or any Lender with respect to indemnified liabilities
which have been determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Agent or any such Lender. The agreements in this Section
shall survive repayment of the Loans and the termination of this Agreement.

an Event of Default, no Lender may so assign to any Person which is a non-

Agent must give its written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), (y) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning

assignment shall execute with and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement with respect to such assignment and a processing and

13.2 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement; (x) such Assignee will independently and without reliance
upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement; (y) such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto; and (z) such Assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of
this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender;

18.9.3 the Agent shall maintain at one of its offices in the City
of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to it
and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,
and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error and the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice;

18.9.4 upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement executed by the parties thereto, the processing and
recordation fee referred to in subsection 18.9.1 above and if required, the
written consent of the Borrower to such assignment, the Agent shall (subject to
the consent of the Agent to such assignment), (x) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement, (y) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (z) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower;

18.9.5 any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable Law, at any time sell to one
or more additional banks or other financial institutions ("Participants")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Commitment of such
Lender or any other interest of such Lender hereunder. In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain the party to this Agreement and
solely responsible for the performance thereof and the Borrower and the Agent
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. The Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off or
compensation to the extent provided in Sections 4.9 and 18.4 in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent
as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a
Lender under this Agreement; PROVIDED that such right of set-off or compensation
shall be subject to the obligation of such Participant to share with the
Lenders, and the Lenders agree to share with such Participant, as provided in
Section 18.5. The Borrower also agrees that no Participant shall have any
right to consent to or refrain from consenting to any amendment, waiver or other
modification of any provision of this Agreement or any Security Document,
PROVIDED, that each Participant shall have the right to consent to any
amendment, of any provision of this Agreement which directly

-64-

extends the Revolving Period, reduces the stated rate or extends the scheduled
time of payment of interest on any Loan or reduces the principal amount of any
Loan, in each case solely with respect to any Loans in which such Participant
has a participating interest. The Borrower also agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Articles 6 and 7 with respect to its
participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time, in
each case with effect as of and from the date on which such Participant becomes
a Participant. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower
shall not be required to pay to any Lender for the benefit of any Participant
more than the amount which it would have been required to pay to the Lender
which granted an interest in the Loans or other obligations of the Borrower
payable hereunder;

18.9.6 the Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Assignee or Participant (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and any prospective Transferee
any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates which has been delivered to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has
been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with
such Lender's credit evaluation of DLFC, the Borrower and the Borrower's
Subsidiaries and Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement, subject
to such Transferee's agreeing to the confidentiality restrictions, if any,
applicable thereto agreed to by such Lender;

18.9.7 if, pursuant to this Section 18.9, any interest in this
Agreement is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the Laws of
any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the assignor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, (x) to represent to the assignor Lender (for the benefit of the
assignor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower) that under applicable Law no taxes
will be required to be withheld by the Agent, the Borrower or the assignor
Lender with respect to any payments to be made to such Transferee in respect of
the Loans, (y) to furnish to the assignor Lender (and, in the case of any
Assignee registered in the Register, the Agent and the Borrower) either U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
(wherein such Transferee claims entitlement to complete exemption from United
States federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder) and (z) to
agree (for the benefit of the assignor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower) to
provide the assignor Lender (and, in the case of any Assignee registered in the
Register, the Agent and the Borrower) a new Form 4224 or Form 1001 upon the
expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable
statements in accordance with applicable United States Law and regulations and
amendments duly executed and completed by such Transferee and to comply from
time to time with all applicable United States Laws and regulations with regard
to such withholding tax exemption.

18.10 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
separate counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

18.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the interpretation and enforcement
thereof shall be governed by and in accordance with the Laws in force in the

unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof in that jurisdiction or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

18.13 NO NOVATION, ETC. Any Lien provided at any time and from time to
time to the Lenders or any one thereof by the Borrower shall not constitute a
payment nor shall it operate as a novation of any amount due hereunder and shall
not operate by way of compensation, set-off or confusion of or merge with any
indebtedness or liability of the Borrower or of any other Person or Persons
(including the Lenders or any one thereof) to the Lenders or any one thereof
under any deed, guarantee, contract, bill of exchange, promissory note, letter
of credit, certificate of deposit or other instrument by which the same may now
or at any time hereafter be represented or evidenced.

18.14 REPLACEMENT OF COMMITMENT LETTER. This Agreement replaces and
supersedes:

18.14.1 that certain letter addressed by National Bank of Canada to
the Borrower dated November 26, 1993, which letter was accepted by the Borrower
on December 2, 1993; and

18.14.2 all other oral or written agreements, understandings and
undertakings between the Lenders, or any one thereof and the Agent or the
Borrower relating to the Commitments.

18.15 LENDERS TO EXERCISE RIGHTS THROUGH AGENT. Subject only to the extent
that under the provisions of Articles 6 or 7 a single Lender is affected and
subject to the provisions of Section 18.2, the Lenders shall only exercise their
rights and remedies under this Agreement and the Security Documents through the
Agent, who shall only act or refrain from acting at the request of the Majority
Lenders.

18.16 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVERS. The Borrower hereby expressly
irrevocably and unconditionally:

18.16.1 submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the
Courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for
the Southern District of New York and appellate courts from any thereof;

18.16.2 consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought
in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or
proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same;

18.16.3 agrees that service of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified
mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the
Borrower at its last address notified to the Agent pursuant to the provisions of
Section 18.1;

Page 78 of 103

-66-

18.16.4 agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by Law or shall limit the right
to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred
to in this subsection any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

Exhibit C

STOCK PLEDGE AGREEMENT

This Stock Pledge Agreement (as the same may be amended, supplemented or
restated from time to time, shall be referred to herein as the "Pledge
Agreement") made as of the 25th day of April, 1994 by and between Laurentian
Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (such corporation and all successors
thereto shall be referred to herein as the "Pledgor"); National Bank of Canada,
New York branch ("National"), The Daiwa Bank, Ltd., National Westminster Bank
PLC and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A./"RaboBank
Nederland", New York branch (such banks and all successors or assigns thereof
and all such other persons who may from time to time become lenders under the
Credit Agreement hereinafter defined shall be referred to herein collectively as
the "Banks"), the Banks being the Lenders identified in that certain Credit
Agreement (as the same may be amended, supplemented or restated from time to
time, shall be referred to herein as the "Credit Agreement") made as of the 25th
day of April, 1994 by and among Pledgor and the Banks; and National Bank of
Canada, having offices in New York, New York (the "Collateral Custody Agent"),
as collateral custody agent hereunder.

WHEREAS, contemporaneously herewith the Pledgor and the Banks have entered
into the Credit Agreement; and

WHEREAS, in consideration of the extension of credit by the Banks to
Pledgor, Pledgor has agreed pursuant to the Credit Agreement to pledge all of
the outstanding capital stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Loyal American
Life Insurance Company, an Alabama corporation (such corporation and all
successors thereto shall be referred to herein as "Loyal American Life"), as
security for the indebtedness incurred under the Credit Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to effect such pledge and to provide for
custody of the stock so pledged to be maintained by the Collateral Custody
Agent, by means of this Pledge Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which
is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1. PLEDGE. The Pledgor hereby pledges, assigns and transfers to
the Banks, and grants to the Banks a continuing security interest in, one
thousand (1,000) shares of the common stock, $3,000 par value per share, of
Loyal American Life, being all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Loyal American Life (the "Pledged Stock"), together with all dividends,
interest, cash, instruments, securities and other property at any time received,
receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for the Pledged
Stock (all of the foregoing being referred

Page 86 of 103

<PAGE>

to collectively as "Collateral"), and all proceeds of any and all of the
Collateral.

Section 2. TRANSFER OF COLLATERAL. Pledgor contemporaneously herewith has
delivered to the Collateral Custody Agent, as Collateral Custody Agent for the
Banks, all certificates representing or evidencing the Pledged Stock,
accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment, which
instruments reflect that any subsequent transfer or assignment by the Banks of
the Pledged Stock is subject to the terms and conditions of this Pledge
Agreement. The Collateral Custody Agent shall hold the Pledged Stock on behalf
of the Banks until required to transfer the Pledged Stock to or to the order of
the Banks or to Pledgor, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of
this Pledge Agreement.

Section 3. OBLIGATIONS SECURED. This Pledge Agreement and the security
interest granted hereby secure the payment and performance when due of all
indebtedness, liabilities, obligations and undertakings of Pledgor to the Banks
arising under or pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the Pledge Agreement
(herein collectively referred to as the "Obligations" and individually as an
"Obligation").

Section 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Pledgor hereby represents and
warrants to the Banks as follows:

(a) Pledgor is the sole owner of the Pledged Stock, free and clear of any
lien, security interest, option, right of first refusal, or other charge or
encumbrance, except for the security interest created by this Pledge Agreement
and any charge or encumbrance as may be imposed by the Change of Control Laws
defined in Section 6 hereof.

(b) All of the Pledged Stock has been duly and validly authorized and
issued, free and clear of any restrictions on transfer other than those imposed
by the Change of Control Laws defined in Section 6 hereof, and Pledgor has and
shall have the right to transfer the Pledged Stock and grant a security interest
therein to the Banks as provided in this Pledge Agreement, subject to the
provisions of Section 6 below.

(c) No effective financing statement or similar notice covering any
Collateral is or shall be on file in any recording office, and no other pledge
or assignment thereof has been made, except in favor of the Banks.

(d) Pledgor shall defend the interests of the Banks in the Collateral
against the claims and demands of all other persons.

Section 5. DIVIDENDS, INTEREST AND VOTING POWER.

(a) Prior to any Event of Default, as defined in Section 9 hereof, and
thereafter until the conditions specified in subsection (c) of this Section 5
have been satisfied so that the Banks shall be entitled to exercise voting
rights and receive dividends as described in such subsection (c), Pledgor shall
be entitled: (i) to exercise all voting power pertaining to the Pledged Stock
for all purposes; and (ii) to receive and retain any and all dividends (other
than stock or liquidating dividends) declared or paid on the Pledged Stock.

(b) (i) If, upon the dissolution or liquidation (in whole or in part) of
Loyal American Life, any sum is paid as a liquidating dividend or otherwise on
or with respect to the Pledged Stock, such sum shall be paid to the Banks to be
held as Collateral hereunder or applied to Obligations then due, in such order
and in such amounts as is specified in the Credit Agreement for payments
thereunder, and the rights of the Banks to same under the terms of this Pledge
Agreement shall under no circumstances be subject to the provisions of Section
6. (ii) If any stock dividend is declared on the Pledged Stock, or any shares
of stock or fractions thereof are issued pursuant to any so-called "stock split"
involving the Pledged Stock, or if any shares of stock, obligations or other
non-cash property are distributed on or with respect to the Pledged Stock,
whether on account of recapitalization, bankruptcy or receivership,
reorganization, merger or consolidation of Loyal American Life, or otherwise,
the shares of stock, obligations or other property so distributed shall be
delivered to the Collateral Custody Agent to be held by it as Collateral
hereunder, and, to the extent such shares of stock, obligations or other
property so distributed are not subject to the Change of Control Laws defined on
Section 6, the rights of the Banks to same under the terms of this Pledge
Agreement shall under no circumstances be subject to the provisions of Section
6. Any cash so distributed shall be paid to the Banks and held or applied as
provided in subsection (b)(i).

(c) Upon and after an Event of Default (unless the same is previously
cured), the Banks shall become entitled, but only after compliance with the
provisions of Section 6 hereof, to exercise voting power pertaining to Pledged
Stock and to receive and retain as Collateral hereunder or apply, as provided in
subsection (b)(i) of this Section 5, to any Obligations then due (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) any and all dividends at any time declared or paid on
Pledged Stock.

(d) All payments, shares of stock and other cash or non-cash property
referred to in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 5, if received by Pledgor
in the circumstances therein described, shall be delivered by Pledgor to the
Banks or the Collateral Custody Agent, as the case may be, immediately upon
receipt thereof

<PAGE>

by Pledgor (duly endorsed or assigned to the Banks as appropriate) in the
identical form received by Pledgor.

Section 6. INSURANCE REGULATORY MATTERS. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Pledge Agreement to the contrary, as it relates to the Pledged Stock
only, the Banks and the Collateral Custody Agent acknowledge that this Pledge
Agreement is subject to the provisions of Sections 27-29-1, ET. SEQ. of the CODE
OF ALABAMA (1975), as the same may be amended from time to time (and to any
successor provisions thereto), and to such regulations as may be promulgated
pursuant thereto or pursuant to any such successor provisions (the foregoing
statutes and regulations being referred to herein as the "Change of Control
Laws"). The Banks and the Collateral Custody Agent agree that, notwithstanding
the occurrence of an Event of Default, neither the Banks nor the Collateral
Custody Agent shall:

(a) exercise any voting power with respect to the Pledged Stock, either
directly or by proxy;

(b) take any action to sell or transfer ownership of the Pledged Stock, or
otherwise exercise the rights specified in Section 6(c) or Section 10 hereof; or

(c) otherwise exercise control, as such term is defined in the Change of
Control Laws, with respect to Loyal American; (including, without limitation, by
causing or attempting to cause Loyal American to enter into any contract with an
affiliate without approval of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of
Alabama (the "Commissioner"));

unless and until the requirements of the Change of Control Laws have been met,
including without limitation any applicable requirements of informational
filings with or of prior approval of such actions by the Commissioner.

Section 7. COVENANTS OF PLEDGOR.

(a) Pledgor shall furnish to the Banks, promptly upon receipt thereof,
copies of all material notices, requests and other documents received by Pledgor
relating to Collateral.

(b) Pledgor shall not (i) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose
(except as specifically permitted by the provisions of Section 5 hereof) of any
Collateral, or create or suffer to exist any lien, security interest, assignment
by operation of law or other charge or encumbrance on or with respect to, any
Collateral, except for the security interest created by this Agreement; or (ii)
take or permit to be taken any other action in connection with any collateral
which would impair the value of the interest or rights of the Pledgor or of the
Banks therein or thereunder.

4

Page 89 of 103

<PAGE>

(c) Pledgor shall promptly execute and deliver, at the expense of Pledgor,
all such further notices, instruments and documents, including, without
limitation, financing statements, and take all such further action, as may be
necessary or advisable, or as the Banks may reasonably request at any time or
times, in order to perfect, preserve and protect the security interest granted
hereby or to enable the Banks to exercise and enforce their rights, remedies and
powers hereunder with respect to Collateral.

Section 8. CARE OF COLLATERAL. The Banks and the Collateral Custody Agent
shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral
while such is actually in the possession of the Banks or the Collateral Custody
Agent. The Banks and the Collateral Custody Agent, respectively, shall be
deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of such
Collateral as is actually in their possession if the Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which the Banks and the Collateral Custody
Agent accord their own property of the same nature.

Section 9. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. An event of default ("Event of Default")
shall be deemed to have occurred hereunder upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Upon and after any Event of Default
which is then continuing, any or all Obligations shall become immediately due
and payable at the option of the Banks, and the Banks may dispose of the
Collateral, but only as provided below.

Section 10. DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL.

(a) Upon and after any Event of Default which is then continuing:

(1) The Banks may direct the Collateral Custody Agent to transfer
custody and possession of the Pledged Stock (and other Collateral, if any,
then in the custody of the Collateral Custody Agent) and the Banks may
thereupon exercise their rights with respect to the Collateral, without
regard to the existence of any other security or source of payment for
Obligations, and in addition to other rights and remedies provided for
herein or otherwise available to them, the Banks shall have all of the
rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Uniform
Commercial Code ("Code") then in effect in New York.

(2) If any notice to Pledgor of the sale or other disposition of
Collateral is required by then applicable law, fifteen (15) days' prior
notice (or, if longer, the shortest period of time permitted by then
applicable law) to Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale of
Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or any other
intended disposition is to be made shall constitute reasonable
notification.

5

Page 90 of 103

<PAGE>

(3) The Banks are authorized, at any such sale, if the Banks deem it
advisable to do so, in order to comply with any applicable insurance or
securities laws, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to
persons who will represent and agree, among other things, that they are
purchasing the Pledged Stock for their own account for investment, and not
with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, or otherwise to restrict
such sale in such other manner as the Banks deem advisable to insure such
compliance. Sales made subject to such restrictions shall be deemed to
have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.

(4) All cash proceeds received by the Banks in respect of any sale,
collection or other enforcement or disposition of Collateral shall be
applied (after deduction of any amounts payable to the Banks pursuant to
Section 12) against Obligations in such order and in such amounts as is
specified in the Credit Agreement with respect to payments thereunder.
Upon payment in full of all Obligations, the Pledgor shall be entitled to
the return of all Collateral, including cash, which has not been used or
applied toward the payment of Obligations and the Banks shall promptly
transfer or pay same to Pledgor.

(b) As it relates to the Pledged Stock only, the exercise of any right by
the Banks under this Section 10 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 6.

Section 11. RELEASE OF PLEDGED STOCK. Upon reduction of the outstanding
Obligations and the amount of credit commitment under the Credit Agreement to an
amount of $35,000,000 or less, the Banks shall, at the written request of
Pledgor, release the Pledged Stock from the security interest granted by this
Pledge Agreement and cause the Collateral Custody Agent to return same to
Pledgor, and this Pledge Agreement shall thereupon terminate, provided that no
"Default" or "Event of Default" (as both of these expressions are defined in the
Credit Agreement) exists at the time of any such request or proposed release.

Section 12. EXPENSES. Pledgor shall pay to the Banks, on demand, the
amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, legal expenses and brokers' fees, which the Banks
may incur in connection with (a) sale, collection or other enforcement or
disposition of Collateral; (b) exercise or enforcement of any of the rights,
remedies or powers of the Banks hereunder or with respect to any or all
Obligations; or (c) failure by Pledgor to perform or observe any agreements of
Pledgor contained herein.

Section 13. WAIVERS, AMENDMENT AND REMEDIES. Pledgor hereby waives
presentment, demand, notice and protest, notice of acceptance of this Agreement,
and, except as provided in Section

6

Page 91 of 103

<PAGE>

10(b), of all action by the Banks in reliance hereon. No course of dealing by
the Banks in exercising any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, and no further exercise thereof and no single or partial
exercise thereof shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy or power of the Banks. No amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent or any
departure by Pledgor therefrom, shall, in any event, be effective unless
contained in a writing signed by the Banks, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given. The rights, remedies and powers of the Banks, not only
hereunder, but also under any instruments and agreements evidencing or securing
Obligations and under applicable law are cumulative, and may be exercised by the
Banks from time to time in such order as they may elect.

Section 14. NOTICES. All demands, notices and other communications from
any party hereto to another hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed
effective when delivered in the manner specified in the Credit Agreement (with
the address for notices to the Collateral Custody Agent being that specified
following the execution of this Pledge Agreement by the Collateral Custody
Agent).

Section 15. BINDING EFFECT. This Pledge Agreement shall (a) remain in
full force and effect until payment and satisfaction in full of all Obligations
or the termination hereof in accordance with Section 11 hereof; (b) be binding
upon Pledgor and the successors in title and assigns of Pledgor; and (c) inure
to the benefit of the Banks and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 16. CAPTIONS. The captions of Sections in this Pledge Agreement

DESJARDINS LAURENTIAN FINANCIAL CORPORATION

LONG-TERM FINANCING

SUPPORT AGREEMENT

AGREEMENT dated as of April 25, 1994, between Desjardins Laurentian
Financial Corporation, a Quebec corporation, (together with its successors and
assigns herein referred to as "DLFC"), and Laurentian Capital Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("LCC").

WHEREAS DLFC owns beneficially approximately 82% of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock of LCC; and

WHEREAS to assist LCC in carrying on its business, LCC plans to finance its
existing US $55,000,000 debt with various financial institutions, all or part of
which indebtedness may in turn be refinanced (such indebtedness being herein
referred to as the "Debt").

WHEREAS DLFC intends to provide certain assurances with respect to the Debt
as specified herein for the benefit of holders of Debt (such holders, together
with others to which the Debt is payable, the "Creditors") with respect to the
stock ownership and maintenance of net worth of LCC; and

WHEREAS LCC plans to finance the borrowing requirements of it and certain
of its subsidiaries with the proceeds of the Debt; and

WHEREAS DLFC has an interest in providing support to LCC to enhance the
opportunities of LCC to incur Debt, when needed; and

WHEREAS DLFC desires to maintain the net worth of LCC; and

WHEREAS the corporate interests of DLFC will be furthered and the value of
its investment in LCC preserved and potentially enhanced by its entering into
this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree for the benefit of the Creditors as
follows:

1. STOCK OWNERSHIP OF LCC

DLFC will directly (or indirectly through one or more controlled
subsidiaries of DLFC) own and hold the entire legal title to or beneficial
interest in at least 51% of the outstanding shares of stock of LCC having the
power under ordinary circumstances to vote for the election of members of the
Board of Directors of LCC and will not directly or indirectly pledge or in any
way encumber or otherwise dispose of any such shares of stock.

1

Page 95 of 103

<PAGE>

However, DLFC will always have the power to sell or otherwise transfer
to any other company controlling, controlled by or under common control with
DLFC, its stock ownership in LCC, as long as DLFC will continue to be in
compliance with paragraph 1 above.

2. MAINTENANCE OF ASSET LEVEL

DLFC will cause LCC to adhere to a dividend policy, and to legal
requirements related to the payment of dividends by LCC, which will cause the
Net Worth of LCC to be the greater of (i) US $75 million and (ii) the amount of
the Debt.

DLFC will cause the Net Worth of LCC to be at all times the greater of
(i) US $75 million and (ii) the amount of the Debt. As used herein "Net Worth"
shall mean as of the time of any determination thereof, the sum of (i) the
aggregate par value of all classes of capital stock of LCC together with the
face value of all capital notes of LCC (as described below), plus (or minus in
the case of deficiency) (ii) the net unrealized gains (losses) on equity
securities of LCC, plus (or minus in the case of deficiency) (iii) the amount of
the paid-in capital and retained earnings of LCC, all determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted U.S. accounting
principles consistently applied, except that for the purpose of this agreement a
contribution by DLFC in the form of capital notes (as described below), and in
all classes of preferred stock, will be treated as part of "Net Worth".

In the event that the Net Worth of LCC shall be less than the greater
of (i) US $75 million and (ii) the amount of the Debt, DLFC will make, or cause
an affiliate of DLFC to make, a contribution to the capital of LCC to the extent
necessary to increase the Net Worth of LCC to the greater of (i) US $75 million
and (ii) the amount of Debt ("Contribution"). A Contribution may, at DLFC's
option, be a direct contribution to the shareholders' equity of LCC, the
purchase of preferred stock of LCC, or of additional shares of common stock or
other equity of LCC, or the loan of funds in the form of capital notes
(unsecured indebtedness subordinate in a manner satisfactory to the Creditors to
all other indebtedness of LCC for borrowed funds). DLFC will make a
Contribution within ten (10) days after the filing by LCC of any Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission which reflects that the Net Worth of LCC is less than the
greater of (i) US $75 million and (ii) the amount of the Debt. In addition,
should the Net Worth of LCC at any other time be less than the greater of (i) US
$75 million and (ii) the amount of the Debt as demonstrated by interim financial
statements of LCC, LCC may demand an immediate Contribution, and DLFC shall make
such Contribution within ten (10) days of such demand.

3. MODIFICATION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

This Agreement may only be modified or amended in ways not less
favorable to LCC or its Creditors and may be terminated at any time by notice
from one party to the

2

Page 96 of 103

<PAGE>

other on not less than ninety (90) days written notice, except that if
termination of this Agreement is necessary to meet any legal or regulatory
requirements applicable to DLFC, this Agreement may be terminated immediately by
DLFC upon written notice to LCC. Notwithstanding any such termination, the
obligations of DLFC under paragraphs 1 and 2 hereof shall remain in full force
and effect until the retirement of Debt supported by this Agreement and
outstanding on the termination date and termination of the commitments of the
Creditors to the Company, unless all of the Creditors (or a trustee acting on
behalf of such Creditors) shall have consented to such termination in writing.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, upon payment in full of
the Debt supported by this Agreement and termination of the commitments of the
Creditors to the Company, this Agreement and all obligations of LCC and DLFC
hereunder shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.

4. ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT

DLFC agrees for the benefit of the Creditors and no others that DLFC
will timely take any and all action necessary to comply with paragraph 2 and
will not hinder or prevent LCC from making a demand. DLFC further agrees that,
if and to the extent that DLFC shall fail to comply with any such demand or with
paragraph 2 or LCC shall fail for whatever reason to make such demand or enforce
its rights under paragraph 2, any Creditor shall have the direct and immediate
right to enforce LCC's rights in respect of paragraph 2 of this Agreement and to
enforce the Contribution.

5. DLFC NOT A GUARANTOR

This Agreement is not, and nothing herein contained, and nothing done
pursuant hereto by DLFC, shall be construed or deemed to constitute, a direct or
indirect guarantee by DLFC to any party of the payment of the interest or
principal of any indebtedness, liability or obligation of any kind or character
(including without limitation the Debt) of LCC or any of LCC's subsidiaries.

6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

DLFC represents and warrants to and for the benefit of LCC and the
Creditors that:

(A) DLFC is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under
the Companies Act (Quebec), Canada, and is duly authorized to do business in
each jurisdiction where, because of the nature of its activities or properties,
such qualification is required.

(B) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement are
within DLFC's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of, and in respect of, DLFC.

Page 97 of 103

<PAGE>

(C) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by DLFC and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of DLFC enforceable against
DLFC in accordance with its terms.

(D) No consent or approval of, or notice to, any governmental body or
regulatory authority or any creditor of DLFC is required for the execution or
delivery of, or the performance of DLFC's obligations under this Agreement, and
such execution, delivery, performance and consummation does not result in any
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation
of any lien in respect of any property of DLFC pursuant to, (i) the charter or
by-laws of DLFC or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any law, regulation, rule,
governmental order or judgment applicable to DLFC or any of its subsidiaries or
(iii) any material agreement, contract or instrument binding upon DLFC or any of
its subsidiaries.

7. SUCCESSORS

This Agreement herein set forth shall be mutually binding upon, and
inure to the mutual benefit of DLFC, the Creditors and their respective
successors and assigns.

8. INCREASE

Any increase of the outstanding LCC Debt above $45,000,000 shall
require the prior written approval of DLFC.

9. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION

(A) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

(B) DLFC hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, for the benefit of
the Creditors:

(i) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City and the

as any Creditor or the Agent may elect;

(ii) waives to the full extent permitted by law any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in
any such court or that such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

of any lawsuit, action or proceeding brought in Canada, or such agent, for
purposes of any lawsuit, action or proceeding brought in the Borough of

WHEREAS under the terms of the Credit Agreement, it is a condition precedent to
the Commitments becoming available to LCC that this agreement be entered into by
the parties hereto;

WHEREAS it is intended by DLFC and LCC under the terms of the Support Agreement
that DLFC shall provide to and for the benefit of the Lenders certain assurances
with respect to the stock ownership and maintenance of Net Worth of LCC;

NOW, THEREFORE, FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, the sufficiency and receipt
whereof are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto have agreed as follows:

Unless there be something in the subject or the context inconsistent therewith,
all capitalized terms and expressions used herein shall have the same meaning as
that ascribed to them in the Support Agreement or the Credit Agreement, as the
case may be.

1. DLFC and LCC do hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the Lenders do
constitute the Creditors referred to in the Support Agreement and shall have the
same benefits, rights, recourses and remedies under the Support Agreement in the
same manner and to the same extent as if the Agent and the Lenders from time to
time were direct signatories to the Support Agreement, including, without
limitation, the right to enforce the Support Agreement against DLFC.

2. DLFC does hereby expressly covenant and agree that any benefit, right,
recourse and remedy to and in favor and any representation and warranty made to
and for the benefit of the Creditors under the Support Agreement, shall, subject
to the provisions hereinafter mentioned, be created to and for the benefit of
the Agent and the Lenders, as if at length set forth herein.

3. The benefits, rights, recourses and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders
to enforce the provisions of the Support Agreement shall be exercised by the
Agent, for and on behalf of the Lenders, in the event that DLFC fails to comply
with any demand made by LCC pursuant to the Support Agreement or to otherwise
perform its obligations thereunder or LCC fails for whatever reason to make such
demand or enforce any benefit, right, recourse or remedy under the Support
Agreement.

4. The benefits, rights, recourses and remedies of the Lenders and the Agent
under the Support Agreement and under the terms hereof shall be independent to
those of LCC and may be enforced, by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders,
independently from LCC.

5. For all purposes of the Support Agreement and this agreement, as and when
DLFC shall be obliged to make a Contribution, at its option, it shall be
permitted to perform such obligation either in the manner contemplated under
paragraph 2 of the Support Agreement or by making direct payments to the Agent
for the account of the Lenders of the amounts of any such Contribution. Any
payment so received by the Agent shall be applied in reduction of the Loans.
The provisions of this Section 5 shall not be construed as a modification to
paragraph 5 of the Support Agreement.

6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of the Support Agreement,
DLFC or LCC shall not be entitled to terminate the Support Agreement unless a
copy of the written notices provided for under said paragraph 3 of the Support
Agreement shall have been forwarded to the Agent within the delays set forth
therein. Furthermore, notwithstanding any such termination:

6.1 the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Support Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect; and

<PAGE>
-3-

6.2 the obligation of DLFC under paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Support
Agreement and under this agreement shall remain in full force and effect until
the repayment in full of the Loans outstanding on the termination date and the
termination of the Commitments, unless the Agent, for and on behalf of the
Lenders, shall have consented to such termination in writing.

7. DLFC does hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that the benefits, rights,
recourses and remedies created herein in favour of the Agent and the Lenders,
are created in favour of the Lenders and in favour of the Agent as agent for
such Person or Persons who now are or may at any time and from time to time
become Lenders under the Credit Agreement, in the same manner and to the same
extent as if each such Person was a Lender named herein.

8. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK.

9. DLFC hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, for the benefit of the Agent
and the Lenders:

(i) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this agreement, or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgement in respect hereof, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New-York City and the courts
of Canada, and consents and agrees to suit being brought in such courts as the
Agent may elect;

(ii) waives to the full extent permitted by-Law any objection that it may
now or hereinafter have to the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in
any such court or that such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and agrees not to be plead or claim the same;

(iii) designates and directs that its offices on the date hereof at 1
Complexe Desjardins, 40th Floor, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H5B1E4, and LCC, with
offices on the date hereof at 640 Lee Road, Suite 303, Wayne, Pennsylvania

City, respectively, and agrees that service by certified mail, return receipt
requested (or its equivalent) upon the Secretary of either itself, for purposes
of any lawsuit, action or proceeding brought in Canada, or such agent, for the
purposes of any lawsuit, action or proceeding brought in the Borough of
Manhattan, New-York City, shall constitute valid and effective service upon DLFC
and that failure of such agent to give notice of such service to DLFC shall not
affect or impair in any way the validity of such service or of any judgment
rendered in any suit, action or proceeding based thereon;

(iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right of the Agent, on
behalf of the Lenders, to affect service of process in any other manner
permitted by Law, and that the Agent shall have the right to bring any legal
proceedings (including a proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by any
of the aforementioned courts) against DLFC in such courts or in any other court
