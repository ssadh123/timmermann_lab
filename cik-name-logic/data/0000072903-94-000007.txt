UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

To the Representatives named in Schedule I
hereto of the Underwriters named in
Schedule II hereto

Dear Sirs:

Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"),
proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the
"Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as representatives (the
"Representatives"), its First Mortgage Bonds of the designation, with the terms
and in the aggregate principal amount specified in Schedule I hereto (the
"Bonds") to be issued under its Trust Indenture, dated as of February 1, 1937,
from the Company to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"),
as heretofore supplemented and amended by supplemental trust indentures and as
to be further supplemented and amended by a supplemental trust indenture
relating to the Bonds (such Trust Indenture as so supplemented and amended and
as to be so supplemented and amended being hereinafter referred to as the
"Indenture"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the
firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and
"Representatives," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or
firms.

1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY. The Company represents
and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:

(a) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and has filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration
statement on such Form, including a prospectus, for the registration under
the Act of the Bonds, which registration statement has become effective.
Such registration statement and prospectus may have been amended or
supplemented from time to time prior to the date of this Agreement (which
date is set forth in Schedule I hereto). Any such amendment or supplement
was filed with the Commission and any such amendment has become effective.
The Company will file with the Commission a prospectus supplement (the
"Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Bonds pursuant to Rule 424 under
the Act. Copies of such registration statement and prospectus, any such
amendment or supplement and all documents incorporated by reference therein
which were filed with the Commission on or prior to the date of this
Agreement have been delivered to you and copies of the Prospectus Supplement
will be delivered to you promptly after it is filed with the Commission.
Such registration statement, as amended prior to the date of this Agreement,
and such prospectus, as amended and supplemented prior to the date of this
Agreement and as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, are hereinafter
called the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus", respectively. Any
reference herein to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be
deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference
therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") on or
before the date of this Agreement and, if the Company files any document
pursuant to the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the termination of the offering of the Bonds by the Underwriters, which
documents are deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus,
the term "Prospectus" shall refer also to said prospectus as supplemented by
the documents so filed from and after the time said documents are filed with
the Commission. There are no contracts or documents of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries that are required to be filed as exhibits to the
Registration Statement or any

1
<PAGE>
documents incorporated by reference therein by the Act, the Exchange Act or
the rules and regulations thereunder which have not been so filed.

(b) No order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or the
Registration Statement has been issued by the Commission and the
Registration Statement, at the date of this Agreement, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the respective rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading;
and, at the time the Prospectus Supplement is filed with the Commission and
at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), the Prospectus will comply in
all material respects with the Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; PROVIDED
that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (A) that part
of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of
Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (B)
the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the
Representatives specifically for use in the Registration Statement or
Prospectus.

(c) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they
were filed with the Commission, conformed in all material respects to the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder, and any documents so filed and incorporated by
reference subsequent to the date of this Agreement will, when they are filed
with the Commission, conform in all material respects to the requirements of
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder; and none of such documents include or will include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit or will omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading.

(d) Deloitte & Touche, which audited certain of the financial statements
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, are independent
public accountants as required by the Act and the rules and regulations of
the Commission thereunder.

(e) The financial statements of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries filed as a part of or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus fairly present the financial position
of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates indicated
and the results of their operations and changes in financial position for
the periods specified, and have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved, except as disclosed in the Prospectus Supplement.

(f) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a
corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota with
due corporate authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged and
to own and operate the properties used by it in such business, as described
in the Prospectus; the Company is qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of the States of North
Dakota and South Dakota; and the Company is not required by the nature of
its business to be licensed or qualified as a foreign corporation in any
other state or jurisdiction; and, except as set forth in the Prospectus
Supplement, the Company has all material licenses and approvals required at
the date hereof to conduct its business.

(g) Each subsidiary of the Company named in Exhibit 22.01 to the
Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Significant Subsidiary")
has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases substantial
properties or in which the conduct of its business requires such
qualification; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each such
subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly

2
<PAGE>
issued and is fully paid and non-assessable; and the capital stock of each
such subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is
owned free and clear of any pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained since
the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated
by reference in the Prospectus any material loss or interference with its
business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not
covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental
action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the
Prospectus Supplement; and, since the respective dates as of which
information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
Supplement, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any
liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, or entered into any
transactions, not in the ordinary course of business, which are material to
the Company and its subsidiaries, and there has not been any material change
in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a
prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs,
management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth
or contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Indenture, the issuance and delivery of the Bonds, the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated, the fulfillment of the terms hereof, nor
compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Bonds and
the Indenture will conflict with, or result in the breach of, any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation,
as amended, or by-laws of the Company, or of any contract, agreement or
instrument to which the Company is a party or in which the Company has a
beneficial interest or by which the Company is bound or of any order, rule
or regulation applicable to the Company of any court or of any federal or
state regulatory body or administrative agency or other governmental body
having jurisdiction over the Company or over its properties.

(j) The Bonds have been duly authorized for issuance and sale pursuant
to this Agreement and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with
the Indenture and delivered and paid for as provided herein, will be duly
issued and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company
enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency and other laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights, and
will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture which will be
substantially in the form heretofore delivered to you.

(k) The Indenture has been duly and validly authorized by the Company
and, when duly executed and delivered by the Company, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, will
constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting enforcement of creditors'
rights.

(l) The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has issued its order
approving capital structure which order authorizes the issuance of the
Bonds, and no other approval of any regulatory public body, state or
federal, is, or will be at the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined),
necessary in connection with the issuance and sale of the Bonds pursuant to
this Agreement, other than approvals that may be required under state
securities laws.

(m) The Company has good and valid title to all real and fixed property
and leasehold rights described or enumerated in the Indenture (except such
properties as have been released from the lien thereof in accordance with
the terms thereof), subject only to taxes and assessments not yet
delinquent; the lien of the Indenture; as to parts of the Company's
property, certain easements, conditions, restrictions, leases, and similar
encumbrances which do not affect the Company's use of such property in the
usual course of its business, and certain minor defects in titles which are
not material, and defects in titles to certain properties which are not
essential to the Company's business; and mechanics' lien claims being
contested or not of record or for the satisfaction or discharge of which
adequate provision has been made by the Company pursuant to the Indenture;
and any real property and buildings held

3
<PAGE>
under lease by the Company is held by it under valid, subsisting and
enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material and do not
interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property and
buildings by the Company.

(n) Other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as of the
date hereof, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if
determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would
individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by
governmental authorities or threatened by others.

(o) The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity "controlled"
by an "investment company, " as such terms are defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(p) Except as set forth in the Prospectus Supplement, the Company and
its subsidiaries (A) are in compliance with any and all applicable federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human
health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or
wastes, pollutants or contaminants ("Environmental Laws"), (B) have received
all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable
Environmental Laws to conduct its respective business and (C) are in
compliance with all terms and conditions of any such permits, licenses or
approvals, except where such noncompliance with Environmental Laws, failure
to receive required permits, licenses or other approvals or failure to
comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, licenses or approvals
would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

2 PURCHASE AND SALE. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance
upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to
sell to the Representatives and each other Underwriter, and the Representatives
and each other Underwriter agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase from
the Company, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto, the
respective principal amounts of the Bonds set forth opposite their respective
names in Schedule II hereto.

3. DELIVERY AND PAYMENT. Delivery of and payment for the Bonds shall be
made at the place, date and time specified in Schedule I hereto (or such other
place, date and time not later than eight full business days thereafter as the
Representatives and the Company shall designate), which date and time may be
postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company (such date
and time being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Bonds shall be
made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several
Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the
Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the
Company by certified or official bank check or checks payable in New York
Clearing House (next day) funds or, if so indicated in Schedule I hereto, in
federal (same day) funds. The Bonds will be delivered in definitive registered
form except that, if for any reason the Company is unable to deliver the Bonds
in definitive form, the Company reserves the right, as provided in the
Indenture, to make delivery in temporary form. Any Bonds delivered in temporary
form will be exchangeable without charge for Bonds in definitive form. The Bonds
will be registered in the names of the Underwriters and in the principal amounts
set forth in Schedule II hereto except that if the Company receives a written
request from the Representatives prior to noon on the third business day
preceding the Closing Date giving the names in which the Bonds are to be
registered and the principal amounts thereof (which shall in each case be a
multiple of $1,000) the Company will deliver the Bonds so registered. The Bonds
will be made available to the Representatives for checking in New York, New
York, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day
preceding the Close Date.

4. AGREEMENTS. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:

(a) With the consent of the Representatives, the Company will cause the
Prospectus Supplement to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (b) under the Act and
will notify the Representatives promptly of such filing. During the period
for which a prospectus relating to the Bonds is required to be delivered
under

4
<PAGE>
the Act, the Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when any
amendment to the Registration Statement shall have become effective, (ii)
when any subsequent supplement to the Prospectus (including documents deemed
to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus) has been filed, (iii)
of any request by the Commission for any amendment of or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for any additional information,
and (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or
threatening of any proceedings for that purpose. The Company will not file
any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus
(including documents deemed to be incorporated by reference into the
Prospectus) unless the Company has furnished to the Representatives a copy
for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed
amendment or supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object. The
Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop
order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.

(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Bonds is required
to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary at any time to
amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange
Act or the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder,
the Company promptly, subject to paragraph (a) of this Section 4, will
prepare and file an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus with the
Commission or will make a filing with the Commission pursuant to Section 13
or 14 of the Exchange Act, which will correct such statement or omission or
will effect such compliance.

(c) The Company will make generally available to its security holders
and to the Representatives a consolidated earnings statement (which need not
be audited) of the Company, for a twelve-month period beginning after the
date of the Prospectus Supplement filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Act, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the end of such period, but
in any event no later than eighteen months after the "effective date of the
Registration Statement" (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), which
will satisfy the provision of Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (including at the option of the
Company, Rule 158).

(d) The Company will furnish to each of the Representatives a signed
copy of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment
thereto, including the Form T-1 of the Trustee and all powers of attorney,
consents and exhibits filed therewith (other than exhibits incorporated by
reference), and will deliver to the Representatives conformed copies of the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated
by reference therein) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an
Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, all amendments of and
supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as available and in such
quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request.

(e) The Company will furnish such information, execute such instruments
and take such action as may be required to qualify the Bonds for sale under
the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and will
maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the
distribution of the Bonds; PROVIDED that the Company shall not be required
to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so
qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or
unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so
subject.

(f) So long as the Bonds are outstanding, the Company will furnish (or
cause to be furnished) to each of the Representatives, upon request, copies
of (i) all reports to stockholders of the Company and (ii) all reports and
financial statements filed with the Commission or any national securities
exchange.

(g) During the period beginning from the date of this Agreement and
continuing to the Closing Date, the Company will not offer, sell, or
otherwise dispose of any first mortgage bonds of the Company (except under
prior contractual commitments which have been disclosed to you), without the
prior written consent of the Representatives, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

5
<PAGE>
5. EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereunder are
consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay all costs and
expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company
hereunder, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all
costs, taxes and expenses incident to the issue and delivery of the Bonds to the
Underwriters, all fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants,
all costs and expenses incident to the preparing, printing and filing of the
Registration Statement (including all exhibits thereto), the Prospectus
(including all documents incorporated by reference therein) and any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, all costs and expenses (including fees and
expenses of counsel) incurred in connection with "blue sky" qualifications, the
determination of the legality of the Bonds for investment by institutional
investors and the rating of the Bonds, and all costs and expenses of the
printing and distribution of all documents in connection with this underwriting.
Except as provided in this Section 5 and Section 8 hereof, the Underwriters will
pay all their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel and
any advertising expenses in connection with any offer they may make.

6. CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE UNDERWRITERS. The obligations of
the Underwriters to purchase the Bonds shall be subject, in the discretion of
the Representatives, to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on
the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof and the Closing
Date, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made in any
certificates given pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(a) The Prospectus Supplement relating to the Bonds shall have been
filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time
period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act
and in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof; no stop order suspending the

been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or
threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on
the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the
Representatives' reasonable satisfaction.

(b) The Representatives shall be furnished with opinions, dated the
Closing Date, of Gary R. Johnson, Vice President and General Counsel of the
Company, substantially in the form included as Exhibit A.

(c) The Representatives shall have received from Gardner, Carton &
Douglas, Chicago, Illinois, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or
opinions dated the Closing Date with respect to the incorporation of the
Company, this Agreement, the validity of the Indenture, the Bonds, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the
Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished
to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of
enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a
certificate of the President or any Vice President of the Company, dated the
Closing Date, as to the matters set forth in clause (a) and (h) of this
Section 6 and to the further effect that the signers of such certificate
have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and this
Agreement and that:

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the
same effect as if made on the Closing Date, and the Company has complied
with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to
be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; and

(ii) there has been no material adverse change in the condition of
the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, financial or
otherwise, or in the earnings, affairs or business prospects of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in
the ordinary course of business, from that set forth or contemplated by
the Registration Statement or Prospectus Supplement.

6
<PAGE>
(e) The Representatives shall have received letters from Deloitte &
Touche (dated the date of this Agreement and Closing Date, respectively, and
in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives) advising that (i)
they are independent public accountants as required by the Act and published
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, (ii) in their opinion,
the consolidated financial statements and supplemental schedules
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and covered by their
opinion filed with the Commission under Section 13 of the Exchange Act
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations of
the Commission thereunder, (iii) they have performed limited procedures, not
constituting an audit, including a reading of the latest available interim
financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, a
reading of the minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors, committees
thereof, and of the Shareholders, of the Company and its subsidiaries since
the date of the most recent audited financial statements included or
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the
Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial accounting matters
and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter,
and on the basis of such limited review and procedures nothing came to their
attention that caused them to believe that: (a) any material modifications
should be made to any unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement
or Prospectus for them to be in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles or any unaudited consolidated financial statements of
the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement or Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations of the Commission applicable to Form 10-Q; (b) with
respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and
except as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement or
Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than five
business days prior to the date of the letter, in the capital stock of the
Company, increases in long-term debt or decreases in stockholders' equity or
net current assets of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as
compared with the amounts shown on the most recent consolidated balance
sheet included or incorporated in the Prospectus, or for the period from the
date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases,
as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in
operating revenues, operating income, net income, or earnings per share of
Common Stock of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances
for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter
shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance
thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the
Representatives; and (iv) they have carried out specified procedures
performed for the purpose of comparing certain specified financial
information and percentages (which is limited to financial information
derived from general accounting records of the Company) included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus with
indicated amounts in the financial statements or accounting records of the
Company and (excluding any questions of legal interpretation) have found
such information and percentages to be in agreement with the relevant
accounting and financial information of the Company referred to in such
letter in the description of the procedures performed by them.

(f) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given
in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there shall not have been
any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in
paragraph (e) of this Section 6 which makes it impractical or inadvisable in
the judgment of the Representatives to proceed with the public offering or
the delivery of the Bonds on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the
Prospectus.

(g) Subsequent to the date hereof, no downgrading shall have occurred,
nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential
downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate
the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded the Company's
debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical
rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes
of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act.

(h) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have
sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included
or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any loss or interference with
its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not
covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental
action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the
Prospectus Supplement, and (ii) since the date of this Agreement, neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have incurred any liabilities
or obligations, direct or contingent, or entered into any transactions, not
in the ordinary course of business, which are material to the Company and
its subsidiaries, and there shall not have been any change in the capital
stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting
the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries otherwise than as
set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement, the effect of which,
in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii) is in the judgment of the
Underwriters so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or
inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Bonds
on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.

(i) No Representative shall have advised the Company that the
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, contains an untrue statement of fact which in the opinion of
counsel for the Underwriters is material or omits to state a fact which in
the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters is material and is required to
be stated therein or is necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

(j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the
Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as they
may reasonably request.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been
fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and
certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be
satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel,
this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be
cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.
Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing, or by
telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

7. CONDITIONS OF COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of the Company to
sell and deliver the Bonds are subject to the following conditions:

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no
proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge
of the Company or the Representative, threatened.

(b) The order of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission referred to
in paragraph (1) of Section 1 shall be in full force and effect.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 7 shall not have been
fulfilled, this Agreement and all obligations of the Company hereunder may be
cancelled on or at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Company. Notice of
such cancellation shall be given to the Underwriters in writing or by telephone
or facsimile transmission confirmed in writing.

8. REIMBURSEMENT OF UNDERWRITERS' EXPENSES. If the sale of the Bonds
provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations
of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied or because of
any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any
agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, other than by reason of a
default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters
severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses that shall have been
reasonably incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of
the Bonds.

8
<PAGE>
9. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning
of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may
become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state
statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Bonds
as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Prospectus or in any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and
agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses
as reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damages, liability or action; PROVIDED that the Company will
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage
or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on
behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use
therein and PROVIDED FURTHER that such indemnity with respect to a prospectus
included in the registration statement or any amendment thereto prior to the
supplementing thereof with the Prospectus Supplement shall not inure to the
benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from
whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased
the Bonds which are the subject thereof if such person was not sent or given a
copy of the Prospectus (but without the documents incorporated by reference
therein) at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Bonds to such
person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue
statement or omission of a material fact contained in such prospectus was
corrected in the Prospectus, provided that the Company shall have delivered the
Prospectus, in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities to permit such
delivery by the Underwriters. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to
any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the
Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriters but only with reference
to written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such
Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the documents
referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and agrees to reimburse each such
indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any
liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this
Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof;
but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from
any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under
this Section 9. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified
party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent
that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly
after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; PROVIDED
THAT if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties which are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party, the indemnified party, or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or
parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by
the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to
such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such

9
<PAGE>
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the
indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the
assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding
sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel and one local counsel,
approved by the Representatives in the case of subparagraph (a), representing
the indemnified parties under subparagraphs (a) or (b), as the case may be, who
are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed
counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party
within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the
indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified
party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i)
or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel
referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to
or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the
offering of the Bonds. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately
preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified
party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such
relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and
the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters
on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net
proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company
bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the
Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the
Prospectus Supplement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the
other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and
the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the Bonds underwritten by it and distributed to the public
were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such
Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection
(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting
obligations and not joint.

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition
to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the
same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under
this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective
Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if
any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

10
<PAGE>
10. DEFAULT BY AN UNDERWRITER. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its
obligation to purchase the Bonds which it has agreed to purchase hereunder (in
this Section called the "Unpurchased Bonds"), the Representatives may in their
discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase
such Unpurchased Bonds on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours
after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the
purchase of such Unpurchased Bonds, then the Company shall be entitled to a
further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or
other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Unpurchased
Bonds on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period,
the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the
purchase of such Unpurchased Bonds, or the Company notifies the Representatives
that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Unpurchased Bonds, the
Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date
for such Unpurchased Bonds for a period of not more than seven days, in order to
effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other
documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which
in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term
"Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted
under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a
party to this Agreement with respect to such Unpurchased Bonds.

(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Unpurchased Bonds of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of such Unpurchased Bonds which remains unpurchased
does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds,
then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter
to purchase the principal amount of Bonds which such Underwriter agreed to
purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter
to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Bonds which
such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Unpurchased Bonds of such
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been
made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability
for its default.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Unpurchased Bonds of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of Unpurchased Bonds which remains unpurchased
exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds, as referred
to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right
described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to
purchase Unpurchased Bonds of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then
this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any
non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne
by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the
indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein
shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for it default.

11. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the
absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior
to delivery of and payment for all Bonds, if prior to such time (i) trading in
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or
limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) if
a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, Minnesota or
New York State authorities, (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company
shall have been suspended or halted, or (iv) if there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the
declaration by the United States of a war or national emergency or any other
calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets in the United
States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives,
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of
the Bonds on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

12. REPRESENTATIONS AND INDEMNITIES TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. The respective
agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the
Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set

11
<PAGE>
forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter
or the Company or any of their respective officers, directors or controlling
persons within the meaning of the Act, and will survive delivery of and payment
for the Bonds. The provisions of Sections 5, 8 and 9 hereof shall survive the
termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

13. NOTICES. All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent
to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or transmitted and confirmed
to them at their address set forth for that purpose in Schedule 1 hereto or, if
sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or transmitted and confirmed to
it at 414 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401, attention Secretary.

14. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and
directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and no other
person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

15. APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.

16. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which, taken together, shall constitute a single agreement among the parties to
such counterparts.

17. REPRESENTATION OF THE UNDERWRITERS. The Representatives represent and
warrant to the Company that they are authorized to act as the representatives of
the Underwriters in connection with this financing and that the Representatives'
execution and delivery of this Agreement and any action under this Agreement
taken by such Representatives will be binding upon all Underwriters.

18. OTHER. Time shall be of the essence for all purposes of this
Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the
Commission's office in Washington D.C. is open for business.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of our agreement,
please sign and return to us the enclosed duplicate hereof, whereupon this
letter and your acceptance shall represent a binding agreement among the Company
and the several Underwriters.

Very truly yours,

EXHIBIT A

FORM OF OPINION OF GARY R. JOHNSON
RE: $ PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS, SERIES DUE
, %
OF NORTHERN STATES POWER COMPANY, A MINNESOTA CORPORATION.

Gentlemen:

For the purpose of rendering this opinion, I have examined the proceedings
taken by Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation, herein call the
"Company," with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of $
principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds, Series due , % herein
called the "Bonds." In connection therewith I have participated in the
preparation of the proceedings for the issuance and sale of the Bonds including
the Underwriting Agreement dated , between you and the Company
relating to your purchase of the Bonds, herein called the "Agreement," and have
either participated in the preparation of or examined the Trust Indenture dated
February 1, 1937, and the Supplemental Trust Indentures thereto and the
Supplemental Trust Indenture dated as of , creating the Bonds,
all from the Company to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee (which Trust
Indenture and Supplemental Trust Indentures are herein collectively called the
"Indenture"). I also have participated in the preparation of or examined the
registration statement and any amendments thereto and the accompanying
prospectuses and any supplements thereto, as filed under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act"), with respect to the Bonds. Whenever the terms
"Registration Statement" or "Prospectus" are used herein, they shall have the
respective meanings set forth in the Agreement. My examination has extended to
all statutes, records, instruments, and documents which I have deemed necessary
to examine for the purposes of this opinion.

I am of the opinion that:

1. The Company is a legally existing corporation under the laws of the
State of Minnesota; has corporate power, right, and authority to do business
and to own property in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South
Dakota in the manner and as set forth in the Prospectus; has corporate
power, right and authority to own securities of its subsidiaries; and has
corporate power, right, and authority to make the Indenture and issue and
sell the Bonds;

2. The authorized capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the
Prospectus and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable;

3. Each Significant Subsidiary, as defined in the Agreement, of the
Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases substantial
properties or in which the conduct of its business requires such
qualification; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each
subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and
non-assessable; and the capital stock of each such subsidiary owned by the
Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free and clear of any
pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity;

4. The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by
the Company and is a valid and binding obligation of the Company, except to
the extent that the provisions for indemnities may be held to be
unenforceable as against public policy;

5. The Indenture has been duly authorized by appropriate corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company, has been duly executed and delivered
and constitutes a legal, valid, and binding instrument enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as the provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code may affect the validity of the lien thereof with respect to
proceeds, products, rents, issues, or profits realized, and additional
property acquired, after the commencement of a case under said Code, and
except as enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture may be limited by
the laws of the states of

1
<PAGE>
Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota (where property covered thereby is
located) affecting the remedies for the enforcement of the security provided
for in the Indenture (which state laws do not in my opinion make such
remedies inadequate for realization of the benefits of such security) or
except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy or insolvency laws or other
similar laws;

6. The issuance of the Bonds in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and the sale and delivery thereof pursuant to the provisions of
the Agreement have been duly authorized by the Company; the statements made
under the captions "Description of New Bonds" and "Supplemental Description
of Offered Bonds" in the Prospectus, insofar as they purport to summarize
provisions of documents specifically referred to therein, fairly present the
information called for with respect thereto by Form S-3; the Bonds are in
due legal form, constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of the
Company, and (subject to the qualifications expressed in paragraph 5 above
with respect to the validity and enforceability of certain of the provisions
of the Indenture) and enforceable in accordance with their terms;

7. The consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Agreement
and the fulfillment of the terms thereof and compliance by the Company with
all the terms and provisions of the Indenture will not result in a breach of
any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other agreement or instrument known to
me to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound, or the Restated
Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or by-laws of the Company or, to the
best of my knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company of any court or of any Federal or state regulatory body or
administrative agency or other governmental body having jurisdiction over
the Company or its property;

8. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act. The
Prospectus Supplement (as defined in the Agreement) has been filed pursuant
to Rule 424(b) under the Act, and no proceedings for a stop order have been
instituted or to the knowledge of such counsel are pending or threatened
under Section 8(d) of the Act; the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has
issued its order approving the Company's capital structure which order
authorizes the issuance of the Bonds; the Indenture has been duly qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture
Act"); and no further approval of, authorization, consent, certificate or
order of any governmental body, federal, state or other, is required in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Bonds by the Company to you as
provided in the Agreement, except as may be required by state securities
laws;

9. At the time the Registration Statement became effective, the
Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and supporting
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which no
opinion is being expressed) complied as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, the
Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

10. I do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings required to
be described in the Prospectus which are not described as required nor of
any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the
Registration Statement which are not described and filed as required;

11. The Indenture is in proper form, conforming to the laws of the
States of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, to give and create the
lien which it purports to create and has been and now is duly and properly
recorded or filed in all places necessary to effectuate the lien of the
Indenture;

12. The Company has good and valid title to all real and fixed property
and leasehold rights described or enumerated in the Indenture (except such
properties as have been released from the lien thereof in accordance with
the terms thereof), subject only to: (a) taxes and assessments not yet
delinquent; (b) the lien of the Indenture; (c) as to parts of the Company's
property, certain easements, conditions, restrictions, leases, and similar
encumbrances which do not affect the Company's use of such property in the
usual course of its business, certain minor defects in titles which are not
material, defects in titles to certain properties which are not essential to
the Company's business; and mechanics' lien claims being contested or not of
record or for the satisfaction or discharge of which adequate provision has
been made by the Company pursuant to the Indenture;

2
<PAGE>
13. The Bonds are secured by and entitled to the benefits of the
Indenture equally and ratably, except as to sinking fund provisions, with
all other bonds duly issued and outstanding under the Indenture by a valid
and direct first mortgage lien of the Indenture on all of the real and fixed
properties, leasehold rights, franchises, and permits now owned by the
Company, subject only to the items set forth in the preceding paragraph 12
of this opinion;

14. The Bonds also are secured equally and ratably, except as to sinking
fund provisions, with all other bonds duly issued and outstanding under the
Indenture by a valid and direct first mortgage lien (subject to permitted
liens as defined in the Indenture) on all real and fixed property hereafter
acquired by the Company in conformity with the terms of the Indenture,
except as the United States Bankruptcy Code may affect the validity of the
lien of such Indenture on property acquired after the commencement of a case
under such Act, except as to the prior lien of the Trustee under the
Indenture in certain events specified therein, and except as otherwise
provided in the Indenture in the case of consolidation, merger, or transfer
of all the mortgaged and pledged property as an entirety;

15. The Company has all necessary power under statutory provisions,
franchises (which expire at various dates), or permits to serve the
customers in the jurisdictions where it provided electric and gas service,
except in certain instances that are not material to the Company; and

16. All statements contained in the Registration Statement and
Prospectus under the caption "Description of New Bonds" purporting to set
forth the opinion of counsel or purporting to be based upon the opinion of
counsel correctly set forth my opinion on said respective matters.

These opinions do not cover titles to easements for water flowage purposes
or rights of way for electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities,
steam mains, and telephone lines. However, the Company has the power of eminent
domain in the states in which it operates.

In the course of my participation in the preparation of the Registration
Statement and Prospectus I made investigations as to the accuracy of certain of
the statements of fact contained therein, I discussed other matters with
officers, employees, and representatives of the Company, and I examined various
corporate records and data. While I do not pass upon or assume responsibility
for, and shall not be deemed to have independently verified, the accuracy and
completeness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or
Prospectus (except as to matters set forth in paragraphs 9 and 16 above) nothing
has come to my attention that would lead me to believe that the Registration
Statement at the time it became effective contained an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the
Prospectus as of the date of the Agreement or at the date hereof contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

In giving my opinion under paragraph 12 above, I have relied upon
examinations of abstracts of titles to properties of the Company, said abstracts
bearing various dates, and nothing has come to my attention which would lead me
to believe that anything has occurred since the dates of the abstracts which
would adversely affect the titles shown on the abstracts. In giving opinions as
to conformity to the laws of States other than Minnesota and as to the
franchises and titles to property of the Company, I have in certain instances
relied upon the opinion of other counsel employed or retained by the Company to
render opinions in respect thereto.

Respectfully submitted,

By

[Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The
Depositary Trust Company, a New York corporation, to the issuer or its agent for
registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is
registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an
authorized representative of The Depositary Trust Company (and any payment is
made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized
representative of The Depositary Trust Company), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER
USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL since the
registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.]*

NORTHERN STATES POWER COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Minnesota (the "Company"), for value received, hereby
promises to pay to or registered assigns, at the office of the
Trustee, in Chicago, Illinois, or, at the option of the registered owner, at the
agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York,
the sum of Dollars in lawful money of the United States of
America, on the first day of February, 1999, and to pay interest hereon from the
date hereof at the rate of five and one-half percent per annum, in like money,
until the Company's obligation with respect to the payment of such principal sum
shall be discharged; said interest being payable at the option of the person
entitled to such interest either at the office of the Trustee, in Chicago,
Illinois, or at the agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, City and
State of New York, on the first day of February and on the first day of August
in each year provided that as long as there is no existing default in the
payment of interest and except for the payment of defaulted interest, the
interest payable on any February 1 or August 1 will be paid to the person in
whose name this bond was registered at the close of business on the record date
(the January 21 prior to such February 1 or the July 21 prior to such August 1
unless any such date is not a business day, in which event it will be the next
preceding business day).

["EXCEPT UNDER THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, THIS
GLOBAL BOND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY OR BY A
NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TO THE DEPOSITORY, ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY,
A SUCCESSOR OF THE DEPOSITORY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR."]*

This bond is one of a duly authorized issue of bonds of the Company, of the
series and designation indicated on the face hereof, which issue of bonds
consists, or may consist, of several series of varying denominations, dates, and
tenor, all issued and to be issued under and equally secured (except insofar as
a sinking fund, or similar fund, established in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture may afford additional security for the bonds of any specific
series) by a Trust Indenture dated February 1, 1937 (the "1937 Indenture"), as
supplemented by 41 supplemental trust indentures (collectively, the
"Supplemental Indentures"), a Supplemental and Restated Trust Indenture dated
May 1, 1988 (the "Restated Indenture") and a new supplemental trust indenture
for the bonds of this series (the "New Supplemental Indenture"), executed by the
Company to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The 1937
Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indentures, the Restated
Indenture and the New Supplemental Indenture herein are referred to collectively
as the "Indenture". Reference hereby is made to the Indenture for a description
of the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security,
the rights of the holders of the bonds as to such security, and the terms and
conditions upon which the bonds may be issued under the Indenture and are
secured. The principal hereof may be declared or may become due on the
conditions, in the manner and at the time set forth in the Indenture, upon the
happening of a default as in the Indenture provided.

With the consent of the Company and to the extent permitted by and as
provided in the Indenture, the rights and obligations of the Company and of the
holders of the bonds, and the terms and provisions of the Indenture and of any
instruments supplemental thereto may be modified or altered by affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 80% in principal amount of the bonds then outstanding
under the Indenture and any instruments supplemental thereto (excluding bonds
challenged and disqualified from voting by reason of the Company's interest
therein as provided in the Indenture); provided that without the consent of all
holders of all bonds affected no such modification or alteration shall permit
the extension of the maturity of the principal of any bond or the reduction in
the rate of interest thereon or any other modification in the terms of payment
of
- ------------------------
*This legend is to be included if the bonds are issued as a Global bond in
book-entry form.

such principal or interest. The foregoing 80% requirement will be reduced to
66 2/3% when all bonds of each series issued under the Indenture prior to May 1,
1985, shall have been retired or all the holders thereof shall have consented to
such reduction.

The Restated Indenture amends and restates the 1937 Indenture and the
Supplemental Indentures. The Restated Indenture will become effective and
operative (the "Effective Date") when all Bonds of each series issued under the
Indenture prior to May 1, 1988 shall have been retired through payment or
redemption (including those bonds "deemed to be paid" within the meaning of that
term as used in Article XVII of the 1937 Indenture) or until, subject to certain
exceptions, the holders of the requisite principal amount of such bonds shall
have consented to the amendments contained in the Restated Indenture. Holders of
the bonds of this series and of each subsequent series of bonds issued under the
Indenture likewise will be bound by the amendments contained in the Restated
Indenture when they become effective and operative. Reference is made to the
Restated Indenture for a complete description of the amendments contained
therein to the 1937 Indenture and to the Supplemental Indentures.

The Company and the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name this
bond is registered as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving
payment and for all other purposes and shall not be affected by any notice to
the contrary.

Bonds of this series are not redeemable prior to maturity for any reason,
and are not subject to a sinking fund.

This bond is transferable as prescribed in the Indenture by the registered
owner hereof in person, or by his duly authorized attorney, at the office of the
Trustee in Chicago, Illinois, or at the option of the owner at the agency of the
Company in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, or elsewhere if
authorized by the Company, upon surrender and cancellation of this bond, and
thereupon a new bond or bonds of the same series and of a like aggregate
principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as
provided in the Indenture, upon payment of taxes or other governmental charges,
if any, that may be imposed in relation thereto.

Bonds of this series are interchangeable as to denominations in the manner
and upon the conditions prescribed in the Indenture.

No charge shall be made by the Company for any exchange or transfer of bonds
of the Series due February 1, 1999, other than for taxes or other governmental
charges, if any, that may be imposed in relation thereto.

The Company shall not be required to issue, transfer or exchange any bond of
this series during a period of ten (10) days next preceding any selection of
bonds of this series to be redeemed. The Company shall not be required to
transfer or exchange any bond of this series called or being called for
redemption in its entirety or to transfer or exchange the called portion of a
bond of this series which has been called for partial redemption.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest
on this bond, or any part thereof, or of any claim based hereon or in respect
hereof or of said Indenture, against any incorporator, or any past, present, or
future shareholder, officer or director of the Company or of any predecessor or
successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, or through any
such predecessor or successor corporation, or through any receiver or a trustee
in bankruptcy, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, or rule of law or
by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability
being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue
hereof, expressly waived and released, as more fully provided in the Indenture.

This bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose unless and
until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on
behalf of Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee under the Indenture, or its
successor thereunder.

February 1, 1999, be in default in the payment of interest upon the bonds of the
Series due February 1, 1999, such bond shall be dated as of the date of the
beginning of the period for which such interest is so in default, and (iii) as
long as there is no existing default in the payment of interest on the bonds of
the Series due February 1, 1999, if any bond of the Series due February 1, 1999,
shall be authenticated after the close of business on any Record Date but on or
prior to the interest payment date relating to such Record Date, it shall be
dated as of such interest payment date.

As long as there is no existing default in the payment of interest on the
bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999, the person in whose name any bond of
the Series due February 1, 1999, is registered at the close of business on any
Record Date with respect to any interest payment date shall be entitled to
receive the interest payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding any
transfer or exchange of such bond of the Series due February 1, 1999, subsequent
to the Record Date and on or prior to such interest payment date, except as and
to the extent the Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on
such interest payment date, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid
to the person in whose name such bond of the Series due February 1, 1999, is
registered on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest
to be fixed by the Trustee, notice thereof shall be given to the registered
holder of any bond of the Series due February 1, 1999, not less than 10 days
prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange
on which the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 may be listed, and upon
such notice as may be required by such exchange.

The term "Record Date" as used herein with respect to any interest payment
date (February 1 or August 1) shall mean the January 21 prior to such February 1
or July 21 prior to such August 1 unless such January 21 or July 21 shall not be
a business day, in which event "Record Date" shall mean the next preceding
business day. The term "business day" as used herein shall mean any day other
than a Saturday or a Sunday or a day on which the offices of the Trustee in the
City of Chicago, Illinois, are closed pursuant to authorization of law.

As used in this Section 2.01, the term "default in the payment of interest"
means failure to pay interest on the applicable interest payment date
disregarding any period of grace permitted by the Indenture.

The "Special Record Date" as used herein shall be fixed in the following
manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of
defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each bond of the Series due February
1, 1999, and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company
shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount
proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of
the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the
benefit of the persons entitled to such defaulted interest as provided in this
Section 2.01. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the
payment
<PAGE>
8

of such defaulted interest which shall be not more than 15 nor less than 10 days
prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the
receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall
promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at
the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such
defaulted interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first
class postage prepaid, to each holder of the bonds of the Series due February 1,
1999, at his address as it appears in the bond register, not less than 10 days
prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
defaulted interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as
aforesaid, such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names
the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999, are registered on such Special
Record Date and shall not be payable pursuant to the paragraph immediately
following in this Section 2.01.

The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest in any other lawful
manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on
which the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999, may be listed, and upon such
notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice is given by the
Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Section 2.01,
such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

SECTION 2.02. The Series due February 1, 1999 are not redeemable prior to
maturity for any reason and are not subject to a sinking fund.

SECTION 2.03. The registered owner of any bond or bonds of the Series due
February 1, 1999, at his option may surrender the same with other bonds of said
series at the office of the Trustee in Chicago, Illinois, or at the agency of
the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, or
elsewhere if authorized by the Company, for cancellation, in exchange for other
bonds of the said series of higher or lower authorized denominations, but of the
same aggregate principal amount, bearing interest from its date, and upon
receipt of any payment required under the provisions of Section 2.04 hereof.
Thereupon the Company shall execute and deliver to the Trustee and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver such other registered bonds to such registered
owner at its office or at any other place specified as aforesaid.

SECTION 2.04. No charge shall be made by the Company for any exchange or
transfer of bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999, other than for taxes or
other governmental charges, if any, that may be imposed in relation thereto.

SECTION 2.05. The bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999, shall be
executed on behalf of the Company by the manual signature of its President or
one of its Vice Presidents or with the facsimile signature of its President, and
its corporate seal shall be thereunto affixed, or printed, lithographed, or
engraved thereon, in facsimile, and attested by the manual signature of its
Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries or with the facsimile signature or
its Secretary. In case any of the officers who shall have signed any bonds or
attested the seal thereon or whose facsimile signature shall be borne by the
bonds shall cease to be such officers of the Company before the bonds so signed
and sealed actually shall have been authenticated by the Trustee or delivered by
the Company, such bonds nevertheless may be issued, authenticated, and delivered
with the same force and effect as though the person or persons who signed such
bonds and attested the seal thereon or whose facsimile signature is borne by the
bonds had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the Company. Any bond
issuable hereunder may be signed or attested by manual or facsimile signature in
behalf of the Company by such person as at the actual date of the execution of
such bond shall be the proper officer of the Company, although at the date of
such bond such person shall not have been an officer of the Company.

SECTION 2.06. (a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (g) below, the
registered holder of all of the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 shall
be The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and the bonds of the Series due February
1, 1999, shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
Payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on any bonds of the
Series due February 1, 1999 registered in the name of Cede & Co. shall be made
by transfer of New York Clearing House or equivalent next day funds with
<PAGE>
9

respect to the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 to the account of Cede &
Co. on each such payment date for the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999
at the address indicated for Cede & Co. in the bond register kept by the
Trustee.

(b) The bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 shall be initially issued
in the form of a separate single authenticated fully registered certificate in
the principal amount of the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999. Upon
initial issuance, the ownership of such bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999
shall be registered in the bond register kept by the Trustee in the name of Cede
& Co., as nominee of DTC. The Trustee and the Company may treat DTC (or its
nominee) as the sole and exclusive registered holder of the bonds of the Series
due February 1, 1999 registered in its name for the purposes of payment of the
principal of and interest on the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999, and
of giving any notice permitted or required to be given to holders under the
Indenture, except as provided in Section 2.06(g) below: and neither the Trustee
nor the Company shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the
Trustee nor the Company shall have any responsibility or obligation to any of
DTC's participants (each a "Participant"), any person claiming a beneficial
ownership in the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999, under or through DTC
or any Participant (each a "Beneficial Owner"), or any other person which is not
shown on the bond register maintained by the Trustee as being a registered
holder, with respect to the accuracy of any records maintained by DTC or any
Participant; the payment of DTC or any Participant of any amount in respect of
the principal of or interest on the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999;
any notice which is permitted or required to be given to registered holders
under the Indenture of bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999; or any consent
given or other action taken by DTC as bondholder. The Trustee shall pay all
principal of and interest on the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999
registered in the name of Cede & Co. only to or "upon the order of" DTC (as that
term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in Minnesota and New
York), and all such payments shall be valid and effective to fully satisfy and
discharge the Company's obligations with respect to the principal of and
interest on such bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 to the extent of the
sum or sums so paid. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.06(c) and (g)
below, no person other than DTC shall receive authenticated bond certificates
evidencing the obligation of the Company to make payments of principal of and
interest on the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999. Upon delivery by DTC
to the Trustee of written notice to the effect that DTC has determined to
substitute a new nominee in place of Cede & Co., and subject to the provisions
of the Indenture with respect to transfers of bonds, the word "Cede & Co." in
this Supplemental Trust Indenture shall refer to such new nominee of DTC.

(c) If the company in its discretion determines that it is in the best
interest of the Beneficial Owners that they be able to obtain bond certificates,
the Company may notify DTC and the Trustee, whereupon DTC will notify the
Participants of the availability through DTC of bond certificates. In such
event, the Trustee shall issue, transfer and exchange bond certificate as
requested by DTC in appropriate amounts pursuant to Article II of the 1937
Indenture prior to the EFFECTIVE DATE, Article II of the Restated Indenture on
and after the Effective Date and Section 2.03 of this Supplemental Trust
Indenture. The Company shall pay all costs in connection with the production of
bond certificates if the Company makes such a determination under this Section
2.06(c). DTC may determine to discontinue providing its services with respect to
the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 at any time by giving written
notice to the Company and the Trustee and discharging its responsibilities with
respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances (if there is no
successor book-entry depository), the Company and the Trustee shall be obligated
(at the sole cost and expense of the Company) to deliver bond certificates as
described in this Supplemental Trust Indenture. If bond certificates are issued,
the provisions of the Indenture shall apply to, among other things, the transfer
and exchange of such certificates and the method of payment and principal of and
interest on such certificates. Whenever DTC requests the Company and the Trustee
to do so, the Company will direct the Trustee (at the sole cost and expense of
the Company) to cooperate with DTC in taking appropriate action after reasonable
notice (1) to make available one or more separate certificates evidencing the
bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 to any Participant or (2) to arrange
for another book-entry depository to maintain custody of certificates evidencing
the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 registered in the name of Cede &
Co. Any successor book-entry depository must be a clearing agency registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 17A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and must enter into an agreement with the
Company and the Trustee agreeing to act as the
<PAGE>
10

depository and clearing agency for the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999
(except as provided in Section 2.06(g) below). After such agreement has become
effective, DTC shall present the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 for
registration of transfer in accordance with Section 12 of Article II of the 1937
Indenture prior to the EFFECTIVE DATE and Section 2.12 of the Restated Indenture
on and after the EFFECTIVE DATE, and the Trustee shall register them in the name
of the successor book-entry depository or its nominee. If a successor book-entry
depository has not accepted such position before the effective date of DTC's
termination of its services, the book-entry system shall automatically terminate
and may not be reinstated without the consent of all registered holders of the
bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Supplemental Trust Indenture
to the contrary, so long as any bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 are
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, all payments with
respect to the principal of and interest on such Bonds of the Series due
February 1, 1999 and all notices with respect to such bonds of the Series due
February 1, 1999 shall be made and given, respectively, to DTC as provided in
the representation letter dated as of the date of delivery of the bonds of the
Series due February 1, 1999 among DTC, the Company and the Trustee. The Trustee
is hereby authorized and directed to comply with all terms of the representation
letter.

(e) In connection with any notice or other communication to be provided
pursuant to the Indenture for the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 by
the Company or the Trustee with respect to any consent or other action to be
taken by the registered holders of the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999,
the Company or the Trustee, as the case may be, shall seek to establish a record
date to the extent permitted by the Indenture for such consent or other action
and give DTC notice of such record date not less than fifteen (15) calendar days
in advance of such record date to the extent possible. Such notice to DTC shall
be given only when DTC is the sole registered holder.

(f) NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR THE TRUSTEE WILL HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR
OBLIGATIONS TO THE PARTICIPANTS OR THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS WITH RESPECT TO (1) THE
ACCURACY OF ANY RECORDS MAINTAINED BY DTC OR ANY PARTICIPANT; (2) THE PAYMENT BY
DTC OR ANY PARTICIPANT OF ANY AMOUNT DUE TO ANY BENEFICIAL OWNER IN RESPECT OF
THE PRINCIPAL OF OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS OF THE SERIES DUE FEBRUARY 1, 1999;
(3) THE DELIVERY BY DTC OR ANY PARTICIPANT OF ANY NOTICE TO ANY BENEFICIAL OWNER
WHICH IS REQUIRED OR PERMITTED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDENTURE TO BE GIVEN TO
REGISTERED HOLDERS; OR (4) ANY CONSENT GIVEN OR OTHER ACTION TAKEN BY DTC AS A
REGISTERED HOLDER.

SO LONG AS CEDE & CO. IS THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF THE BONDS OF THE SERIES
DUE FEBRUARY 1, 1999 AS NOMINEE OF DTC, REFERENCES HEREIN TO THE BONDS OF THE
SERIES DUE FEBRUARY 1, 1999 OR REGISTERED HOLDERS OF THE BONDS OF THE SERIES DUE
FEBRUARY 1, 1999 SHALL MEAN CEDE & CO. AND SHALL NOT MEAN THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS
OF THE BONDS OF THE SERIES DUE FEBRUARY 1, 1999 NOR DTC PARTICIPANTS.

(g) The Company, in its sole discretion, may terminate the services of DTC
with respect to the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 if the Company
determines that; (i) DTC is unable to discharge its responsibilities with
respect to the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999; or (ii) a continuation
of the requirement that all of the outstanding bonds of the Series due February
1, 1999 be registered with the registration books kept by the Trustee in the
name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, is not in the best interest of the
Beneficial Owners of the bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999. After such
event and if no substitute book-entry depository is appointed by the Company,
bond certificates will be delivered as described in the Indenture.

(h) Upon the termination of the services of DTC with respect to the bonds of
the Series due February 1, 1999 pursuant to subsections (c) or (g) of this
Section 2.06 after which no substitute book-entry depository is appointed, the
bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999 shall be registered in whatever name or
names holders transferring or exchanging bonds of the Series due February 1,
1999 shall designate in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT.

SECTION 3.01. The Trustee shall, if requested in writing so to do by the
Company, promptly appoint an agent or agents of the Trustee who shall have
authority to authenticate registered bonds of the Series due February 1, 1999,
in the name and on behalf of the Trustee. Such appointment by the Trustee shall
be evidenced by a certificate of a vice-president of the Trustee delivered to
the Company prior to the effectiveness of such appointment.

SECTION 3.02. (a) Any such authenticating agent shall be acceptable to the

under such laws to act as authenticating agent, has a combined capital and
surplus of at least $10,000,000, and is subject to supervision or examination by
Federal or State authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition
at lease annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 3.02
the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition
so published.

(b) Any corporation into which any authenticating agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion, or consolidation to which any authenticating agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency business
of any authenticating agent, shall continue to be the authenticating agent
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
the Trustee or the authenticating agent.

(c) Any authenticating agent at any time may resign by giving written
notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any
time, and upon written request of the Company to the Trustee shall, terminate
the agency of any authenticating agent by giving written notice of termination
to such authenticating agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any
authenticating agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 3.02, the Trustee, unless otherwise requested in
writing by the Company, promptly shall appoint a successor authenticating agent,
which shall be acceptable to the Company. Any successor authenticating agent
upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, duties, and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with
like effect as if originally named. No successor authenticating agent shall be
appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 3.02.

(d) The Trustee agrees to pay to any authenticating agent, appointed in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.02, reasonable compensation for
its services, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such
payments.
