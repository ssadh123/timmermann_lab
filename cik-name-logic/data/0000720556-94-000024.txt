shall be assumed to have occurred on the first day of the Refer-
ence Period, (3) the Incurrence of any Debt during the Reference

Period, (4) Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to any
Debt (whether existing or being Incurred) computed on a pro forma

Securities or any Affiliate or Restricted Subsidiary of the

not to be Outstanding, except that, in determining whether the

Trustee to take any action under any provision of this Indenture,
the Company shall furnish to the Trustee such certificates and
opinions as may be required under the Trust Indenture Act. Each
such certificate or opinion shall be given in the form of an
Officers' Certificate, if to be given by an officer of the
Company, or an Opinion of Counsel, if to be given by counsel, and
shall comply with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and
any other requirement set forth in this Indenture.

Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance
with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall
include

(1) a statement that each individual signing such
certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition
and the definitions herein relating thereto;

(2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the
examination or investigation upon which the statements or
opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based;

(3) a statement that, in the opinion of each such
individual, he has made such examination or investigation as
is necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion as
to whether or not such covenant or condition has been
complied with; and

(4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such
individual, such condition or covenant has been complied
with.

Section 103. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.

If several matters are required to be certified by, or
covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not
necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by
the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so
certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person
may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and
one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such
Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one
or several documents.

Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company
may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a
certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless
such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should
know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with
respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is
based are erroneous. Any such certificate or opinion of counsel
may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a
certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or
officers of the Company stating that the information with respect
to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company,
unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care
should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations
with respect to such matters are erroneous.

If any Person is required to make, give or execute two or
more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements,
opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but
need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.

Section 104. Acts of Holders; Record Dates.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and
evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar
tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly
appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly
provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument
or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, if it is hereby
expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or
instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced
thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the
Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any
such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture
and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee
and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section
104.

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness
of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other
officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds,
certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing
acknowledged to him the execution thereof. If such execution is
by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual
capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute
sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the
execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of
the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other
manner that the Trustee deems sufficient.

The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security
Register.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall
bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of
every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof
or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything
done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the
Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Security.

The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose
of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities entitled to
give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by
this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of Securities,
provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the
provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the
giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction
referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set
pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities
on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to
take the relevant actions whether or not such Holders remain
Holders after such record date; provided that no such action
shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the
applicable Record Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite
principal amount of Outstanding Securities on such record date;
and provided further that for the purpose of determining whether
Holders of the requisite principal amount of such Securities have
taken such action, no Security shall be deemed to have been Out-
standing on such record date unless it is also Outstanding on the
date such action is to become effective. Nothing in this
paragraph shall prevent the Company from setting a new record
date for any action for which a record date has previously been
set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date
previously set shall automatically and with no action by any
Person be cancelled and of no effect), nor shall anything in this
paragraph be construed to render ineffective any action taken by
Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding
Securities on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any
record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at
its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the
proposed action by Holders and the applicable Record Expiration
Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of
Securities in the manner set forth in Section 106.

The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose
of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities entitled to
join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii)
any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii)
any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section
507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512. If any
record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of
Outstanding Securities on such record date, and no other Holders,
shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or
direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such
record date; provided that no such action shall be effective
hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Record
Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of
Outstanding Securities on such record date; and provided further
that for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the
requisite principal amount of such Securities have taken such
action, no Security shall be deemed to have been Outstanding on
such record date unless it is also Outstanding on the date such
action is to become effective. Nothing in this paragraph shall
be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record
date for any action (whereupon the record date previously set
shall automatically and without any action by any Person be
cancelled and of no effect), nor shall anything in this paragraph
be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of
the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities on the
date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set
pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's
expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the matter(s) to
be submitted for potential action by Holders and the applicable
Record Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and
to each Holder of Securities in the manner set forth in Section
106.

With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section
104, the party hereto that sets such record date may designate
any day as the "Record Expiration Date" and from time to time may
change the Record Expiration Date to any earlier or later day,
provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of
the proposed new Record Expiration Date is given to the other
party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities in the
manner set forth in Section 106, on or before the existing Record
Expiration Date. If a Record Expiration Date is not designated
with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 104,
the party hereto that set such record date shall be deemed to
have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as
the Record Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its
right to change the Record Expiration Date as provided in this
paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Record Expiration
Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable
record date.

Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder
to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular
Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the
principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly
appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such
appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal
amount.

Section 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or
permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished
to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given,
furnished or filed in writing and mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to or with the Trustee at its Corporate
Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise
herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-

at any other address previously furnished in writing to the
Trustee by the Company.

Section 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.

When this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any
event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise
herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at such
Holder's address as it appears in the Security Register, not
later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the
earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. 
Neither the failure to mail or give such notice as otherwise
provided herein, nor any defect in any notice so mailed or given
to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such
notice with respect to other Holders. When this Indenture
provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in
writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either
before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equiva-
lent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed
with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition prece-
dent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service
or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give
such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with
the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient
notification for every purpose hereunder.

Section 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with
a provision of the Trust Indenture Act that is required under
such Act to be part of and govern this Indenture, the latter
provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture
modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act
that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall
be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be
excluded, as the case may be.

shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity,

that all of the provisions hereof shall be enforceable to the
full extent permitted by law.

which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually
on January 15 and July 15 in each year, commencing July 15, 1997
at the rate of 10-1/4% per annum, until the principal hereof is
paid or duly provided for, provided that any principal and
premium, if any, and any such installment of interest, that is
overdue shall bear interest at the rate of 11-1/4% per annum (to
the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally en-

paid or duly provided for, and such interest shall be payable on
demand. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, as provided in
such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security
(or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the
close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest,

made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled there-
to as such address shall appear in the Security Register.

Section 203. Form of Reverse of Security.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of
Securities of the Company designated as its 10-1/4% Senior
Discount Notes due 2004 (herein called the "Securities"), limited
in aggregate principal amount of $529,640,000, issued and to be
issued under an Indenture, dated as of March 24, 1994 (herein
called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning as-
signed to it in such instrument), between the Company and IBJ
Schroder Bank & Trust Company, as Trustee (herein called the
"Trustee" which term includes any successor trustee under the
Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a
statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties
and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.

The Securities are subject to redemption upon not less than
30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at any time on or after
January 15, 1999 and prior to maturity, as a whole or in part, at
the election of the Company, at the following Redemption Prices
(expressed as percentages of the principal amount), if redeemed
during the 12-month period commencing on or after January 15 of
the years indicated,

together in the case of any such redemption with accrued
interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, but interest
installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such
Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more predecessor Securities, of record at
the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on
the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.

The Securities do not have the benefit of any sinking fund
obligations.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company
shall be required to make an Offer to Purchase all or a specified
portion of the Securities at a Purchase Price in cash equal to
(a) 101 percent of the Accreted Value thereof on any Purchase
Date occurring prior to January 15, 1997 or (b) 101 percent of
the principal amount thereof on any Purchase Date occurring on or
after January 15, 1997 plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to such Purchase Date. If the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary
or any Eligible Joint Venture consummates an Asset Disposition,
under certain circumstances, the Company shall be required to
make an Offer to Purchase up to all or a specified portion of the
Securities at a Purchase Price in cash equal to (a) 100 percent
of the Accreted Value thereof on any Purchase Date occurring
prior to the January 15, 1997 or (b) 100 percent of the principal
amount thereof on any Purchase Date occurring on or after January
15, 1997, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to such Pur-
chase Date, in an amount equal to any Net Cash Proceeds from such
an Asset Disposition that are not used to reinvest in the
business of the Company and/or repay in a permanent reduction of
Debt of the Company or Debt of its Restricted Subsidiaries or
Eligible Joint Ventures. Holders of Securities shall receive
notice of any such Offer to Purchase from the Company prior to
the related Purchase Date and may elect to have such Securities
purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of Holder to
Elect Purchase" appearing on the reverse side of the Security.

In the event of redemption, or purchase pursuant to an Offer
to Purchase, of this Security in part only, a new Security or
Securities for the portion hereof not redeemed or purchased shall
be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation
hereof.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time
of the entire Debt of this Security or certain restrictive
covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security,
including, without limitation, covenants relating to Offers to
Purchase, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions
set forth in the Indenture.

If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, there
may be declared due and payable the Default Amount of the
Securities, in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture. Until January 15, 1997, the Default Amount in respect
of this Security as of the date upon which the Securities are
declared due and payable shall equal the Accreted Value of this
Security as of such date. On and after January 15, 1997, the
Default Amount in respect of this Security as of any particular
date shall equal 100% of the principal amount of this Security
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to such date.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at any time by the
Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the
time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on
behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance
by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and
certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. 
In addition, without the consent of any Holder of a Security, the
Indenture and the Securities may be amended and supplemented to
cure any ambiguity or inconsistency, make other changes that
shall not adversely affect the rights of the Holders or certain
other matters specified in the Indenture. Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this
Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether
or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this
Security.

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right
to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for
the appointment of a receiver, or trustee or for any other remedy
thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the
Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with
respect to the Securities, the Holders of not less than 25
percent in principal amount of the Securities at the time Out-
standing shall have made written request to the Trustee to insti-
tute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee
and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee
shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of Securities at the time Outstanding a direc-
tion inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to
institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such
notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not
apply to certain suits described in the Indenture, including any
suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the
enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or
interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed
herein (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption
Date or, in the case of any purchase of this Security required to
be made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, on or after the Pur-
chase Date).

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of
this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on
this Security at the times, place, manner and rate, and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is
registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this
Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of
the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York,
(which initially shall be the corporate trust office of the
Trustee), duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instru-
ment of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the
Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more
new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees.

The Securities are issuable only in registered form without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple
thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a
like aggregate principal amount of Securities of like tenor of a
different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
payable in connection therewith.

A director, officer, employee, stockholder or incorporator
of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations
of the Company under this Security or the Indenture or for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting this Security waives
and releases all such liability. Such waiver and release are
part of the consideration for the issuance of this Security.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration
of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the
Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this
Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes,
whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Company,
the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

Interest on this Security shall be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year of 12 30-day months.

All terms used in this Security that are defined in the
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.

The Indenture and this Security shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
as applied to contracts made and performed under the State of New
York, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

ARTICLE THREE

The Securities

Section 301. Title and Terms.

The aggregate principal amount of Securities that may be
authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is limited to
$529,640,000, except for Securities authenticated and delivered
upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu
of, other Securities pursuant to Section 304, 305, 306, 906 or
1108 or in connection with an Offer to Purchase pursuant to
Section 1013 or 1015.

The Securities shall be known and designated as the "10-1/4%
Senior Discount Notes due 2004" of the Company. Their Stated
Maturity shall be January 15, 2004 and they shall bear interest
at the rate of 10-1/4% per annum, from July 15, 1997 or from the
most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid
or duly provided for, as the case may be, payable semi-annually
on January 15 and July 15, commencing July 15, 1997 until the
principal thereof is paid or made available for payment.

The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
Securities shall be payable at the office or agency of the
Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York main-
tained for such purpose and at any other office or agency main-
tained by the Company for such purpose; provided that (except as
may be provided in any representation letter or agreement with a
"clearing" agency registered under the Exchange Act), payment of
the principal of (and premium, if any, on) the Securities shall
be made only upon presentation and surrender thereof at any such
office or agency and at the option of the Company payment of
interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person
entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security
Register.

Section 302. Denominations.

The Securities shall be issuable only in registered form
without coupons and only in denominations of $1,000 principal
amount and any integral multiple thereof. 

Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.

The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by
its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice
Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested
by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The
signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be
manual or facsimile.

Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of
individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the
Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such indi-
viduals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to
the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities
executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication,
together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery
of such Securities; and the Trustee in accordance with such
Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities as
in this Indenture provided and not otherwise.

Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there
appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substan-
tially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by
manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be
conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security
has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

Section 304. Temporary Securities.

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the
Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities that are printed,
lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in
any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the
definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with
such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other
variations as the officers executing such Securities may deter-
mine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.

If temporary Securities are issued, the Company shall cause
definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. 
After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary
Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon
surrender of the temporary Securities at any office or agency of
the Company designated pursuant to Section 1002 without charge to
the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary Securities, the Company shall execute and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like
principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denomina-
tions and of a like tenor. Until so exchanged, the temporary
Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Securities.

Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Ex-
change.

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such
office and in any other office or agency designated pursuant to
Section 1002 being herein sometimes collectively referred to as
the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for
the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. 
The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the
purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as
herein provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security
at an office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to
Section 1002 for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the
designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities
of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal
amount and tenor.

At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for
other Securities of any authorized denominations and of a like
aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the
Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever
any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the
Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to
receive.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the
Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon
such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or
the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and
the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other govern-
mental charge that may be imposed in connection with any regis-
tration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than ex-
changes pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1108 or in accordance
with any Offer to Purchase pursuant to Section 1013 or 1015, and
in any such case not involving any transfer.

Neither the Trustee, the Security Registrar nor the Company
shall be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of
redemption of Securities selected for redemption under Section
1104 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mail-
ing or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security
so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.

If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of like tenor and
principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously
outstanding.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee
(i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may
be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either
of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company
or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such
destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor
and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously
outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the
Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security,
pay such Security.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section,
the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and
expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 306 in
lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute
an original additional contractual obligation of the Company,
whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at
any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any
and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 306 are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies
with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, de-
stroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

Interest on any Security that is payable and is punctually
paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be
paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on
the Regular Record Date for such interest.

Any interest on any Security that is payable but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date
(herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by
virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest
may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as
provided in clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted
Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. 
The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of
Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the
date of the proposed payment and at the same time the Company
shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the
aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted
Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such
money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the
Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in this
clause. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date
for the payment of such Defaulted Interest that shall be not more
than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the
proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by
the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee
shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date
and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause
notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the
Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder in the
manner specified in Section 106 not less than 10 days prior to
such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having
been so given, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the
Persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective Pre-
decessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on
such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant
to the following clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest
in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements
of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed,
and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if,
after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed
payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be
deemed practicable by the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each
Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of
transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security
shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to
accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

Section 308. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security
is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of
receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (sub-
ject to Section 307) interest on such Security and for all other
purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and
neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or
the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 309. Cancellation.

All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption,
registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any
Offer to Purchase pursuant to Section 1013 or 1015 shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to
the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company
may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any
Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder that
the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all
Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the
Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in
exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section
309, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All
cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as
directed by a Company Order; provided that the Trustee shall not
be required to destroy cancelled Securities.

Section 310. Computation of Interest.

Interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year of 12 30-day months.

Section 311. CUSIP Numbers.

The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP"
numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall
use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption or repurchase as a
convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state
that no representation is made as to the correctness of such
numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in
any notice of a redemption or repurchase and that reliance may be
placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Securities, and any such redemption or repurchase shall not be
affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

Section 312. Global Securities.

(a) The Company designates The Depository Trust Company as
the initial Depositary hereunder. The Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Article Three, authen-
ticate and deliver, one or more Global Securities that (i) shall
represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to, the
aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities to be repre-
sented by such Global Securities to be issued hereunder, (ii)
shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global
Security or its nominee, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee
to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instructions,
(iv) shall be substantially in the form of Security specified
pursuant to Article Two, with such changes therein as may be
necessary to reflect that each Global Security is a global
security, and (v) shall bear a legend substantially to the
following effect: "This Security is issued in global form and
registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee thereof. 
Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for
Securities in definitive form in accordance with the terms hereof
and of the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, this
Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depos-
itary to a nominee of the Depositary, or by a nominee of the
Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Deposi-
tary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor
Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. Unless
this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of
the Depositary to the Company or its agent for registration of
transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is
registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee and any
payment is made to the Depositary or its nominee, ANY TRANSFER,
PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY
PERSON IS WRONGFUL since the registered owner hereof has an
interest herein."

(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section
312 or of Section 305, unless and until a Global Security is
exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form,
a Global Security may be transferred, in whole, but not in part,
and in the manner provided in this Section 312, only by the
Depositary to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of
such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such
Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a
successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a
nominee of such successor Depositary or in the manner specified
in Section 312(c).

(c) If at any time the Depositary for the Securities
represented by one or more Global Securities notifies the Company
that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary of the
Securities or if at any time the Depositary shall no longer be
eligible as provided in the second sentence of the definition of
"Depositary" and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the
Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or
becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, the Company
shall promptly execute, and the Trustee shall promptly
authenticate and deliver, Securities in definitive form without
coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global
Security or Securities then outstanding in exchange for such
Global Security or Securities, and this Section 312 shall no
longer be applicable to the Securities. In addition, the Company
may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the
Securities shall no longer be represented by Global Securities. 
In such event the Company shall promptly execute, and the
Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order evidencing such
determination by the Company, shall promptly authenticate and
deliver, Securities in definitive form without coupons, in
authorized denominations and in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or
Securities then outstanding in exchange for such Global Security
or Securities and this Section 312 shall no longer be applicable
to the Securities. Upon the exchange of the Global Securities
for such Securities in definitive form without coupons, in
authorized denominations, such Global Securities shall be
cancelled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive form
issued in exchange for the Global Securities pursuant to this
Section 312(c) shall be registered in such names and in such
authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to
instructions from its direct or indirect participants or
otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver
such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are
so registered.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the
contrary, so long as the Securities outstanding are represented
by one or more Global Securities, the Company shall pay or cause
to be paid the principal of, and interest on, such Global
Securities to the Depositary or its nominee of the holder by wire
transfer of immediately available funds on the date such payments
are due.

Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and
Annulment.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
specified in Section 501(7) or (8)) occurs and is continuing,
then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not
less than 25 percent in principal amount at Stated Maturity of
the Outstanding Securities may declare the Default Amount of all
the Securities to be due and payable immediately by a notice in
writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders),
and upon any such declaration such Default Amount shall become
immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in
Section 501(7) or (8) occurs, the Default Amount of the Securi-
ties then Outstanding shall ipso facto become immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other Act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holder.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has
been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the
money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article Five provided, the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the
Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration
and its consequences if

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee
a sum sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities
(without duplication of any amount thereof paid or deposited
pursuant to clause (B) or (C) below),

(B) the Default Amount of (and premium, if any,
on) any Securities that have become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration (including any Securities required to
have been purchased on any Purchase Date pursuant to an Offer to
Purchase made by the Company) and, to the extent that payment of
such interest is lawful, interest thereon at the rate provided by
the Securities (without duplication of any amount thereof paid or
deposited pursuant to clause (A) above or clause (C) below),

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest
is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate provided by
the Securities (without duplication of any amount thereof paid or
deposited pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above), and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee
hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default (other than the non-payment
of the Accreted Value of Securities that have become due solely
by such declaration of acceleration) have been cured or waived as
provided in Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforce-
ment by Trustee.

The Company covenants that if

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on
any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such
default continues for a period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal or
Accreted Value of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the
final Stated Maturity thereof or, with respect to any Security
required to have been purchased pursuant to an Offer to Purchase
made by the Company, at the Purchase Date thereof,

the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the
benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then
due and payable on such Securities Accreted Value or principal,
as the case may be, (premiums, if any) and interest, and, to the
extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforce-
able, interest on any overdue Accreted Value or principal, as the
case may be, (premium, if any) and interest, and on any overdue
interest, at the rate provided by the Securities, and, in
addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reason-
able compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such
demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of
the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to
judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the
Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the
moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided
by law out of the Property of the Company or any other obligor
upon the Securities, wherever situated.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee
may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights
and the rights of the Holders by such appropriate judicial
proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect
and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement
of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other
proper remedy.

Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company
(or any other obligor upon the Securities), its Property or
assets or its creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the
Accreted Value or principal, as the case may be, (premium, if
any) or interest of the Securities then shall be due and payable
as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespec-
tive of whether the Trustee has made any demand on the Company
for the payment of overdue Accreted Value or principal, as the
case may be, (premium, if any) or interest shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to
file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to
take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act
in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee (including
any claim for reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Trustee, its agents or counsel) allowed in
any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be autho-
rized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable
or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and
any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,
sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such
payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders,
to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trust-
ee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee
under Section 607. To the extent that payment of any such com-
pensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel, and any amounts due the Trustee under
Section 607 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding shall
be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by
a Lien and shall be paid out of any and all distributions,
dividends, money, securities and other properties that the
Holders of the Securities may be entitled to receive in such
proceedings whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorgani-
zation or arrangement or otherwise.

No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize
the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights
of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding;
provided that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for
the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and
be a member of a creditors or other similar committee.

Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of
Securities.

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the
Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without
the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof
in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding
instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as
trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,
after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the
Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

Section 506. Application of Money Collected.

Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article
Five shall be applied in the following order, at the date or
dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of
such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or
interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation
thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender
thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee
under Section 607; and

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and
unpaid on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit
of which such money has been collected, ratably, without
preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due
and payable on such Securities in respect of principal (and
premium, if any) and interest; and

THIRD: To whosoever may be lawfully entitled
thereto, the remainder, if any.

Section 507. Limitation on Suits.

No Holder of any Security shall have any right to institute
any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this
Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or
for any other remedy hereunder, unless

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to
the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25 percent in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities shall have made
written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in
respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee
hereunder; 

(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee
reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
to be incurred in compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such
notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute
any such proceeding; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written
request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities;

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders
shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by
availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb
or prejudice the rights of any other Holders, or to obtain or to
seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or
to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner
herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the
Holders.

Section 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Princi-
pal, Premium and Interest.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the
Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute
and unconditional, to receive full payment of the Accreted Value
or principal, as the case may be, of (and premium, if any) and
(subject to Section 307) interest on such Security on the
respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in
the case of redemption on the Redemption Date or in the case of
an Offer to Purchase made by the Company and accepted as to such
Security, on the Purchase Date) in accordance with the terms of
this Indenture and the Securities and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be im-
paired without the consent of such Holder.

Section 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding
to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such
proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or
has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder,
then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such
proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be re-
stored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee
and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had
been instituted.

Section 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in
the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein
conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is
intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder or otherwise shall not prevent the concurrent assertion
or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any
Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event
of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a
waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. 
Every right and remedy given by this Article Five or by law to
the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time,
and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the
Holders, as the case may be.

Section 512. Control by Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities shall have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any
rule of law or with this Indenture, and

(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed
proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction.

Section 513. Waiver Of Past Defaults.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities may on behalf of the Holders of all
the Securities waive any past default hereunder and its conse-
quences, except a default

(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any) or interest on any Security (including any Security that is
required to have been purchased pursuant to an Offer to Purchase
that has been made by the Company), or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that
under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and
any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have
been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

Section 514. Undertaking for Costs.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action
taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require
any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the
costs of such suit, and may assess costs against any such party
litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust
Indenture Act.

Section 515. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do
so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in
any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of,
any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any
time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit

The Trustee

Section 601. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

(a) The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be
as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Whether or not therein
expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating
to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording
protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of
this Section 601.

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,

(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and
only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture,
and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Indenture against the Trustee; and

(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the
Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements
and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon
certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming
to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any
such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof are
specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or
not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture but need
not confirm the accuracy of any calculations contained therein.

(c) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of
care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise
or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(d) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to
relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action,
its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct,
except that

(1) this subsection (d) shall not be construed to
limit the effect of subsections (b) or (c) of this Section 601;

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of
judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it
shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining
the pertinent facts;

any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities relating to the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture; and

(4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if
it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability
is not reasonably assured to it. 

Section 602. Notice of Defaults; Notice of Acceleration.

Within 90 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event
of Default, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders, as

such Default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived;
provided that, except in the case of a default in any payment of
the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security
and any payment required in connection with a Change of Control
or an Asset Disposition, the Trustee shall be protected in with-
holding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the
executive committee or a trust committee of directors or
Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that
the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders;
and provided further that in the case of any Default or Event of
Default of the character specified in Section 501(5), no such
notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the
occurrence thereof.

Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a

established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action
hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein
specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its
part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;

(d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the
written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be
full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any
action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith
and in reliance thereon;

(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders
pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have
offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against
the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it
in compliance with such request or direction;

(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any
investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other
evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the
Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or
investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and,
if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or
investigation, it shall be entitled (subject to reasonable
confidentiality arrangements as may be proposed by the Company)
to examine the books, records and premises of the Company,
personally or by agent or attorneys;

(g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or
powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly
or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any

upon it by this Indenture. 

Section 604. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Secu-
rities.

The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except
the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as
the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no

representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Inden-
ture or of the Securities. The Trustee shall not be accountable
for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the
proceeds thereof.

Section 605. May Hold Securities.

The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any
Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee
of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise
deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security
Registrar or such other agent.

Section 606. Money Held in Trust.

Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be
segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

Section 607. Compensation and Reimbursement.

The Company agrees

(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such
reasonable compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from
time to time agree in writing for all services rendered by it
hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an
express trust);

(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to
reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the
Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture
(including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and dis-
bursements of its agents and counsel) except any such expense,
disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence
or bad faith; and

(3) to indemnify the Trustee in its individual
capacity and each of its officers, directors, agents and counsel
for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, damage, claim,

such Person's part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the performance
of any of its powers and duties hereunder, including the costs
and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability
in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its
powers or duties hereunder and complying with any process served
upon the Trustee or any such other Person hereunder.

The Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Securities with
respect to all Property and funds held or collected by the
Trustee hereunder for any amount owing to it pursuant to this
Section 607, except with respect to funds held in trust for the
benefit of the Holders of particular Securities.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in
connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 501(7)
or Section 501(8), the expenses (including the reasonable charges
and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the servic-
es are intended to constitute expenses of administration under
any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law.

The Company's obligations under this Section 607 and any
Lien arising hereunder shall survive the resignation or removal
of the Trustee, the discharge of the Company's obligations

the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the
Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture.

Section 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder that shall
be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act
to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000 and its Corporate Trust Office in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York and shall be subject to
supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If
such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 609
and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the
combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 609, it shall resign immediately in the manner and
with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article Six.

Section 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no
appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article Six
shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements
of Section 611.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Company. If an instrument of
acceptance by a successor Trustee in accordance with the applica-
ble requirements of Section 611 shall not have been delivered to
the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trust-
ee.

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.

(d) If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section
608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least
six months, or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under
Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting
or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the
Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public offi-
cer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may
remove the Trustee, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder
who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six
months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situat-
ed, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal
of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become
incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of
Trustee for any cause, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall
promptly appoint a successor Trustee. If, within one year after
such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of
such vacancy, a successor Trustee shall be appointed by Act of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the
successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its
acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable
requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee and
supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no
successor Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Company or
the Holders and accepted appointment in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 611, any Holder who has been a
bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on
behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Trustee.

(f) The Company shall give written notice of each
resignation and each removal of the Trustee and each appointment
of a successor Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in
Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor
Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

Section 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

Every successor Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring
Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon
the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights,
powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on
request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring
Trustee shall, upon payment of any amounts then due under Section
607, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the
retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to
such successor Trustee all property and money held by such
retiring Trustee hereunder, subject, nevertheless, to its Lien,
if any, provided for in Section 607. Upon request of any such
successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instru-
ments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to
such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts.

No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at
the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be
qualified and eligible under this Article.

Section 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation
or Succession to Business.

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corpora-
tion resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to
which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding
to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the
Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provi-
ded that such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligi-
ble under this Article Six, without the execution or filing of
any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated,
but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating
Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities
so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor
Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

Section 613. Preferential Collection
of Claims Against Company.

If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the
Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee
shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act
regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any
such other obligor).

Section 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

The Trustee may from time to time appoint an Authenticating
Agent or Agents that shall be authorized to act on behalf of the
Trustee to authenticate Securities issued upon original issue and
upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption or
partial purchase or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so
authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture
and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authen-
ticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in
this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities
by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication,
such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and
delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and
a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee
by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States
of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia,
authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having
a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State
authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the re-
quirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for
the purposes of this Section 614, the combined capital and
surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. If at any time an
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 614, such Authenticating
Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
specified in this Section 614.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consoli-
dation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or
any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate
trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be
an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be
otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee
or the Authenticating Agent. In case any Securities shall have
been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Authenticating
Agent then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or
consolidation to such authenticating Authenticating Agent may
adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authen-
ticated with the same effect as if such successor Authenticating
Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.

An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The
Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating
Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating
Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time
such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accord-
ance with the provisions of this Section 614, the Trustee may
appoint a successor Authenticating Agent that shall be acceptable
to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the
manner provided in Section 106, to all Holders as their names and
addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authen-
ticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall
become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its
predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as
an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall
be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section
614.

The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from
time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this
Section.

If an appointment is made pursuant to this Section 614, the
Securities may have endorsed thereon, in lieu of the Trustee's
certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of
authentication in the following form:

This is one of the Securities described in the within-
mentioned Indenture.

the place of payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any
Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair
the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof, or

(2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities, the consent of whose Holders is required
for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose
Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain
provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and
their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or

(3) modify the obligations of the Company to make
Offers to Purchase from the Excess Proceeds of Asset Dispositions
or upon a Change of Control or to modify the definitions related
thereto, or

(4) subordinate a right of payment, or otherwise
subordinate, the Securities to any other indebtedness, 

(5) modify any provisions of this Indenture relating
to the calculation of Accreted Value, or

(6) modify any of the provisions of this Section 902,
Section 513 or Section 1020, except to increase any such percent-
age or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture
cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Security affected thereby.

It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this
Section 902 to approve the particular form of any proposed
supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act
shall approve the substance thereof.

After a supplemental indenture under this Section becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby
a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture. Any
failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any default
therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the
validity of any such supplemental indenture.

In connection with any supplemental indenture or waiver
under this Article Nine, the Company may, but shall not be
obligated to, offer to any Holder who consents to such supplemen-
tal indenture, or to all Holders, consideration for such Holder's
consent to such supplemental indenture.

Section 903. Execution of Supplemental Indentures.

In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by,
any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the
modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture,
the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section
601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of
Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture
is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may,
but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental
indenture that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

Section 904. Effect of Supplemental Indentures.

Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this
Article Nine, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance
therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of
this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities
theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder
shall be bound thereby, unless it makes a change described in any
of clauses (1) through (6) of Section 902, in which case, the
supplemental indenture shall bind only each Holder of a Security
who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security
or portion of a Security that evidences the same Debt as the
consenting Holder's Security; provided that any such waiver shall
not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment
of principal and premium of and interest on a Security, on or
after the respective dates set for such amounts to become due and
payable, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment
on or after such respective dates.

Section 905. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act.

Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this
Article Nine shall conform to the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act.

Section 906. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Inden-
tures.

Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution
of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article Nine may,
and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form ap-
proved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such
supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new
Securities so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the
Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may
be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities. 
Any failure to make the appropriate notation on a new Security
shall not affect the validity of such Security. 

ARTICLE TEN

Covenants

Section 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.

The Company shall duly and punctually pay the principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities in accor-
dance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.

Section 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

The Company shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The
City of New York, an office or agency where Securities may be
presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the
Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall
give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and
any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any
time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office
or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address
thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may
be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,
and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to
receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. 
In the event any such notice or demands are so made or served on
the Trustee, the Trustee shall promptly forward copies thereof to
the Company.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or
more other offices or agencies (in or outside the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York) where the Securities may be
presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may
from time to time rescind such designations; provided that no
such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the
Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, for such purposes. 
The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of
any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency. The Company hereby
initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as
such office of the Company.

Section 1003. Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust.

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying
Agent, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of
(and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities,
segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and
premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums
shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided and shall promptly notify the Trustee of its action or
failure so to act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents,
it shall, prior to each due date of the principal of (and
premium, if any) or interest on any Securities, deposit with a
Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium,
if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held as
provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying
Agent is the Trustee) the Company shall promptly notify the
Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

The Company shall cause each Paying Agent other than the
Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in
which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to
the provisions of this Section 1003, that such Paying Agent shall
(i) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act
applicable to it as Paying Agent, (ii) give the Trustee notice of
any default by the Company (or other obligor upon the Securities)
in the making of any payment of principal of (and premium, if
any) or interest in respect of the Securities and (iii) during
the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other
obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment in
respect of the Securities, upon the written request of the
Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by
such Paying Agent as such.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining
the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other
purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay,
to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such
Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same
trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to
the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further
liability with respect to such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent,
or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security
and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and
premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the
Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of
such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor,
look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability
of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust
money shall thereupon cease; provided that the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment,
may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in
a newspaper published in the English language, customarily
published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The
City of New York, or mail to such Holder, or both, notice that
such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified
therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of
such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then
remaining shall be repaid to the Company.

Section 1004. Existence.

Subject to Article Eight, the Company shall do or cause to
be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force
and effect its corporate existence, rights (charter and
statutory) and material franchises; provided that the Company
shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if
the Board of Directors in good faith shall determine that the
preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the
business of the Company and that the loss thereof does not
materially adversely affect the Holders.

Section 1005. Maintenance of Properties.

The Company shall cause all material properties used or
useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Eligible Joint Venture to be main-
tained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and
supplied with all necessary equipment and shall cause to be made
all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and
improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may
be necessary so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all
times; provided that nothing in this Section 1005 shall prevent
the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of
any of such material or properties or, subject to the provisions
of Section 1015, disposing of any of them if such discontinuance
or disposal is, as determined by the Company in good faith,
desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any
Restricted Subsidiary and does not materially adversely affect
the Holders, provided that the Restricted Subsidiaries and the
Eligible Joint Ventures of the Company shall not be required to
comply with the forgoing provisions of this Section 1005 if they
are prevented or restricted in doing so by the terms of any loan
or financing agreement, any charter document, partnership or
joint venture agreement or any other agreement or instrument, all
of which are expressly acknowledged to take precedence over the
terms hereof.

Section 1006. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

The Company shall pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all
taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed
upon the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or upon
the income, profits or property of the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, and (2) all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies that, if unpaid, might by law become a
Lien upon the property of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries; provided that the Company shall not be required to
pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax,
assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or
validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which disputed amounts adequate reserves have
been accrued to the extent required by GAAP.

Section 1007. Maintenance of Insurance.

The Company shall, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiar-
ies and the Eligible Joint Ventures to, keep at all times all of
their Properties that are of an insurable nature insured against
loss or damage with insurers believed by the Company to be re-
sponsible to the extent that Property of similar character is
usually so insured by Persons similarly situated and owning like
Properties in accordance with good business practice. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries and
the Eligible Joint Ventures to, use the proceeds from any such
insurance policy to repair, replace or otherwise restore all
material Properties to which such proceeds relate, provided that
the Company shall not be required to repair, replace or otherwise
restore any such material Property if the Company in good faith
determines that such inaction is desirable in the conduct of the
business of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and does not
materially adversely affect the Holders, and provided further
that the Company (only in respect of agreements governing its
Non-Recourse Debt), the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Eligible
Joint Ventures of the Company shall not be required to apply
insurance proceeds to repair, replace or restore any material
Property if they are prevented or restricted in doing so by the
terms of any loan or financing agreement, any charter document,
partnership or joint venture agreement or any other agreement or
instrument, all of which are expressly acknowledged to take
precedence over the terms hereof.

The Company may, and may permit its Restricted Subsidiaries
and Eligible Joint Ventures to, adopt such other plan or method
of protection, in lieu of or supplemental to insurance with
insurers, whether by the establishment of an insurance fund or
reserve to be held and applied to make good losses from
casualties, or otherwise, conforming to the system of
self-insurance maintained by Persons similarly situated and
owning like Properties and which does not materially adversely
affect the Holders, as may be determined by the Company in good
faith.

Section 1008. Limitation on Debt.

(a) The Company shall not Incur any Debt, including
Acquisition Debt, unless, after giving effect to the Incurrence
of such Debt and the receipt and application of the proceeds
therefrom, the Fixed Charge Ratio of the Company would be equal
to or greater than 2.0 to 1.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1008(a), the
Company may Incur each and all of the following: (i) Company
Refinancing Debt, (ii) Debt of the Company to any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture that is ex-
pressly subordinated in right of payment to the Securities,
provided that any transfer of such Debt by a Restricted Subsid-
iary or an Eligible Joint Venture (other than to another
Restricted Subsidiary or another Eligible Joint Venture), or any
transfer of the Company's ownership interest, or a portion
thereof, in such Restricted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint
Venture or the interest, or a portion thereof, of Kiewit in a
Permitted Joint Venture or an Eligible Joint Venture (which
transfer has the effect of causing such Restricted Subsidiary or
such Eligible Joint Venture to cease to be a Restricted
Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture, as the case may be),
shall be deemed to be an Incurrence of Debt that is subject to
the provisions of this Section 1008 other than this clause (ii),
(iii) Debt in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $50
million outstanding at any one time may be issued under or in re-
spect of Permitted Working Capital Facilities, (iv) Non-Recourse
Debt Incurred in respect of a Permitted Facility in which the
Company has a direct interest, (v) Debt in respect of Currency
Protection Agreements or Interest Rate Protection Agreements,
(vi) Purchase Money Debt, provided that the amount of such Debt
(net of any original issue discount) does not exceed 90% of the
fair market value of the Property acquired, (vii) the Securities
and other Debt outstanding as of the Issue Date of the Securities
(other than Debt to the extent that it is extinguished, retired,
defeased or repaid in connection with the original issuance of
the Securities), including Debt that is Incurred in respect of
interest or discount on such Debt (or Redeemable Stock issued as
dividends in respect of Redeemable Stock) pursuant to the terms
of the agreement or instrument that governs such Debt (or such
Redeemable Stock) as in effect on the Issue Date of the
Securities and (viii) Debt in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $50 million outstanding at any one time.

Section 1009. Limitation on Subsidiary Debt.

(a) The Company shall not permit any of its Restricted Sub-
sidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture, to Incur any Debt.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1009(a), each
and all of the following Debt may be Incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture: (i) Debt outstanding as
of the Issue Date of the Securities, (ii) Debt owed by a
Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture to the Company
or another Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or another
Eligible Joint Venture that either directly or indirectly owns
all or a portion of the Company's interest in, or directly or
indirectly is owned by, such Restricted Subsidiary or such
Eligible Joint Venture, as the case may be, and that does not own
any Permitted Facility or a direct or indirect interest therein,
other than the Permitted Facility or any other Permitted Facility
that is located on the same localized geothermal reservoir or a
direct or indirect interest therein owned by such Restricted
Subsidiary or Eligible Joint Venture, (iii) Non-Recourse Debt In-
curred in respect of a Permitted Facility in which such Restri-
cted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture has a direct or
indirect interest (which may include Construction Financing pro-
vided by the Company to the extent permitted under Section 1010
as a "Permitted Investment"), (iv) Subsidiary Refinancing Debt,
(v) Acquired Debt, (vi) Debt in respect of Currency Protection
Agreements or Interest Rate Protection Agreements and (vii)
Permitted Funding Company Loans.

Section 1010. Limitation on Restricted Payments. 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture to,
directly or indirectly, make any Restricted Payment unless at the
time of such Restricted Payment and after giving effect thereto
(a) no Event of Default and no event that, after the giving of
notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of
Default, has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Company could
Incur at least $1 of Debt under Section 1008(a) and (c) the
aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments made by the Company,
its Restricted Subsidiaries and the Eligible Joint Ventures (the
amount so made, if other than in cash, to be determined in good
faith by the Chief Financial Officer, as evidenced by an
Officers' Certificate, or, if more than $15 million, by the Board
of Directors, as evidenced by a Board resolution) after the Issue
Date of the Securities, is less than the sum (without duplica-
tion) of (i) 50% of the Adjusted Consolidated Net Income of the
Company for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning
on the first day of the first fiscal quarter that begins after
the Issue Date of the Securities and ending on the last day of
the fiscal quarter immediately prior to the date of such calcula-
tion, provided that if throughout any fiscal quarter within such
period the Ratings Categories applicable to the Securities are
rated Investment Grade by S&P and Moody's (or if both do not make
a rating of the Securities publicly available, an equivalent
Rating Category is made publicly available by another Rating
Agency), then 75% (instead of 50%) of the Adjusted Consolidated
Net Income (if more than zero) with respect to such fiscal
quarter shall be included pursuant to this clause (i), and pro-
vided further that if Adjusted Consolidated Net Income for such
period is less than zero, then minus 100% of the amount of such
net loss, plus (ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds re-
ceived by the Company from and after the Issue Date of the
Securities from (A) the issuance and sale (other than to a
Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture) of its
Capital Stock (excluding Redeemable Stock, but including Capital
Stock other than Redeemable Stock issued upon conversion of, or
in exchange for Redeemable Stock or securities other than its
Capital Stock), (B) the issuance and sale or the exercise of war-
rants, options and rights to purchase its Capital Stock (other
than Redeemable Stock) and (C) the issuance and sale of convert-
ible Debt upon the conversion of such convertible Debt into
Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Stock), but excluding the
net proceeds from the issuance, sale, exchange, conversion or
other disposition of its Capital Stock (I) that is convertible
(whether at the option of the Company or the holder thereof or
upon the happening of any event) into (x) any security other than
its Capital Stock or (y) its Redeemable Stock or (II) that is
Capital Stock referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the
definition of "Permitted Payment", plus (iii) the net reduction
in Investments of the types specified in clauses (iv) and (v) of
the definition of "Restricted Payment" that result from payments
of interest on Debt, dividends, or repayment of loans or advanc-
es, the proceeds of the sale or disposition of the Investment or
other return of the amount of the original Investment to the
Company, the Restricted Subsidiary or the Eligible Joint Venture
that made the original Investment from the Person in which such
Investment was made, provided that (x) the aggregate amount of
such payments shall not exceed the amount of the original Invest-
ment by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that reduced
the amount available pursuant to this clause (c) for making
Restricted Payments and (y) such payments may be added pursuant
to this clause (iii) only to the extent such payments are not
included in the calculation of Adjusted Consolidated Net Income,
provided further that if Investments of the types specified in
clauses (iv) and (v) of the Definition of "Restricted Payment"
have been made in any Person and such Person thereafter becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture, then the
aggregate amount of such Investment (to the extent that they have
reduced the amount available pursuant to this clause (c) for
making Restricted Payments), net of the amounts previously added
pursuant to this clause (iii), may be added to the amount avail-
able for making Restricted Payments. The foregoing clause (c)
shall not prevent the payment of any dividend within 60 days
after the date of its declaration if such dividend could have
been made on the date of its declaration without violation of the
provisions of this Section 1010(a).

(b) None of the Company, any of its Restricted Subsid-
iaries or any Eligible Joint Venture shall be deemed to have made
an Investment at the time that a Person that is a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company or an Eligible Joint Venture ceases to
be a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture (other
than as a result of a Restricted Subsidiary being designated as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary), although any subsequent Investment
made by the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and Eligible
Joint Ventures in such Person shall be Investments that shall be
subject to the foregoing paragraph unless and until such time as
such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint
Venture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the designation of a
Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, in the
manner provided in the definition of "Unrestricted Subsidiary,"
shall be an Investment that shall be subject to the foregoing
paragraph and (ii) the transfer of the Company's interest (or
portion thereof) in an entity that has been deemed to be an
Eligible Joint Venture directly or indirectly to an Unrestricted
Subsidiary shall be an Investment (to the extent of the interest
transferred) that shall be subject to the foregoing paragraph.

Section 1011. Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture to,
directly or indirectly, conduct any business or enter into or
permit to exist any transaction or series of related transactions
(including, but not limited to, the purchase, sale or exchange of
Property, the making of any Investment, the giving of any
Guarantee or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of
the Company, such Restricted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint
Venture, as the case may be, unless (i) such business,
transaction or series of related transactions is in the best
interest of the Company, such Restricted Subsidiary or such
Eligible Joint Venture, (ii) such business, transaction or series
of related transactions is on terms no less favorable to the
Company, such Restricted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint
Venture than those that could be obtained in a comparable arm's
length transaction with a Person that is not such an Affiliate
and (iii) with respect to such business, transaction or series of
related transactions that has a fair market value or involves
aggregate payments equal to, or in excess of, $10 million, such
business, transaction or series of transactions is approved by a
majority of the Board of Directors (including a majority of the
Disinterested Directors), which approval is set forth in a Board
Resolution delivered to the Trustee certifying that, in good
faith, the Board of Directors believes that such business,
transaction or series of transactions complies with clauses (i)
and (ii) above.

Section 1012. Limitation on Liens.

The Company may not Incur any Debt that is secured, directly
or indirectly, with, and the Company shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint
Venture to, grant a Lien on the Property of the Company, its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture now owned
or hereafter acquired unless contemporaneous therewith or prior
thereto the Securities are equally and ratably secured except for
(i) any such Debt secured by Liens existing on the Property of
any entity at the time such Property is acquired by the Company,
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture,
whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of such Property or
otherwise, provided that such Liens (x) are not created, incurred
or assumed in contemplation of such Property being acquired by
the Company, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible
Joint Venture and (y) do not extend to any other Property of the
Company, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint
Venture, (ii) any other Debt that is required by the terms
thereof to be equally and ratably secured as a result of the
Incurrence of Debt that is permitted to be secured pursuant to
another clause of this Section 1012, (iii) Liens that are granted
in good faith to secure Debt (A) contemplated by clause (iv) of
Section 1008(b) or (B) contemplated by clauses (ii), (iii) and
(vi) of Section 1009(b), provided that, in the case of Debt owed
to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, 
the President or Chief Financial Officer of the Company
determines in good faith, as evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate, that such Liens are required in order to effect such
financing and are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, than Liens, taken as a whole, customarily accepted (or in
the absence of industry custom, reasonably acceptable) in
comparable financings or comparable transactions in the
applicable jurisdiction, (iv) Liens existing on the Issue Date of
the Securities, (v) Liens incurred to secure Debt incurred by the
Company as permitted by clause (vi) of Section 1008(b), provided

als, refundings or refinancings of any Debt secured by the Liens

subject to the original Lien, (viii) Liens incurred to secure
obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' accep-
tances, surety, bid, operating and performance bonds, performance
guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations (or reim-
bursement obligations with respect thereto)(in each case, to the
extent incurred in the ordinary course of business), (ix) any
Lien arising by reason of (A) any judgment, decree or order of
any court, so long as such Lien is being contested in good faith

ings that may have been duly initiated for the review of such
judgment, decree or order have not been finally terminated or the
period within which such proceedings may be initiated has not
expired, (B) taxes, duties, assessments, imposts or other govern-

thereof, (G) easements, rights-of-way, zoning and similar
covenants and restrictions and other similar encumbrances or
title defects that do not in the aggregate materially interfere
with the ordinary conduct of the business of the Company, any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture or (H)
leases and subleases of real property that do not interfere with

Section 1013. Purchase of Securities Upon a Change of Control.

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each
Holder of the Securities shall have the right to require that the
Company repurchase such Holder's Securities at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the Accreted Value thereof on the date
of purchase plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of pur-
chase.

(b) Within 30 days following a Change of Control, the
Company shall mail a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the
Trustee, stating (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and
that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase
such Holder's Securities at the purchase price described in
Section 1013(a) (the "Change of Control Offer"), (2) the circum-
stances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control
(including information with respect to pro forma historical
income, cash flow and capitalization after giving effect to such
Change of Control), (3) the purchase date (which shall be not
earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed) (the "Change of Control Purchase Date"), (4)
that original issue discount on any Security not tendered or
purchased shall continue to accrete until January 15, 1997, and
thereafter interest on any such Security shall continue to ac-
crue, (5) any Security properly tendered pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer shall cease to accrete original issue discount
or accrue interest, as the case may be, after the Change of
Control Purchase Date (assuming sufficient moneys for the
purchase thereof are deposited with the Trustee), (6) that
Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the
Security, with the form entitled "Option of Holder To Elect Pur-

later than the close of business on the third Business Day (or
such shorter periods as may be required by applicable law)
preceding the Change of Control Purchase Date, a telegram, telex,

chased, payment in an amount equal to the purchase price, and
promptly authenticate and mail to each Holder a new Security
having a principal amount equal to any portion of such Holder's
Securities that were surrendered but not tendered and purchased. 
The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of
Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of
Control Purchase Date. 

If the Company is prohibited by applicable law from making
the Change of Control Offer or purchasing Securities thereunder,
the Company need not make a Change of Control Offer pursuant to
this Section 1013 for so long as such prohibition is in effect.

The Company shall comply with all applicable tender offer
rules, including, without limitation, Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, in connection with a Change of Control Offer.

Section 1014. Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restric-
tions Affecting Subsidiaries.

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture to, create
or cause to become, or as a result of the acquisition of any
Person or Property, or upon any Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture, remain subject to, any
consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction of any kind on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary or any Eligible Joint
Venture to (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions per-
mitted by applicable law on any Capital Stock of such Restricted
Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture owned by the Company,
any other Restricted Subsidiary or any other Eligible Joint
Venture, (b) make payments in respect of any Debt owed to the
Company, any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or any
Eligible Joint Venture, (c) make loans or advances to the Company
or to any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or any other
Eligible Joint Venture that is directly or indirectly owned by
such Restricted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture or (d)
transfer any of its Property to the Company or to any other
Restricted Subsidiary or any other Eligible Joint Venture that
directly or indirectly owns or is owned by such Restricted
Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture, other than those
encumbrances and restrictions created or existing (i) on the
Issue Date of the Securities, (ii) pursuant to this Indenture,
(iii) in connection with the Incurrence of any Debt permitted
under the provisions described in clause (iii) of Section
1009(b), provided that, in the case of Debt owed to Persons other
than the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Eligible
Joint Venture, the President or the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company determines in good faith, as evidenced by an
Officers' Certificate, that such encumbrances or restrictions are
required to effect such financing and are not materially more re-
strictive, taken as a whole, on the ability of the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary or the applicable Eligible Joint Venture to
make the payments, distributions, loans, advances or transfers
referred to in clauses (a) through (d) of this Section 1014 than
encumbrances and restrictions, taken as a whole, customarily ac-
cepted (or, in the absence of any industry custom, reasonably
acceptable) in comparable financings or comparable transactions
in the applicable jurisdiction, (iv) in connection with the
execution and delivery of an electric power or thermal energy
purchase contract, or other contract related to the output or
product of, or services rendered by a Permitted Facility, to
which such Restricted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture
is the supplying party or other contracts with customers, sup-
pliers and contractors to which such Restricted Subsidiary or
such Eligible Joint Venture is a party and where such Restricted
Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture is engaged, directly or
indirectly, in the development, design, engineering, procurement,
construction, acquisition, ownership, management or operation of
such Permitted Facility, provided that the President or the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company determines in good faith, as
evidenced by an Officers' Certificate, that such encumbrances or
restrictions are required to effect such contracts and are not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, on the ability of
the applicable Restricted Subsidiary or the applicable Eligible
Joint Venture to make the payments, distributions, loans,
advances or transfers referred to in clauses (a) through (d) of
this Section 1014 than encumbrances and restrictions, taken as a
whole, customarily accepted (or, in the absence of any industry
custom, reasonably acceptable) in comparable financings or
comparable transactions in the applicable jurisdiction, (v) in
connection with any Acquired Debt, provided that such encumbrance
or restriction was not incurred in contemplation of such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture and
provided further that such encumbrance or restriction does not
extend to any other Property of such Person at the time it became
a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture, (vi) in
connection with the Incurrence of any Debt permitted under clause
(iv) of Section 1009(b), provided that, in the case of Debt owed
to Persons other than the Company and its Restricted Subsid-
iaries, the President or the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company determines in good faith, as evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate, that such encumbrances or restrictions taken as a
whole are not materially more restrictive than the encumbrances
and restrictions applicable to the Debt and/or equity being
exchanged or refinanced, (vii) customary non-assignment provi-
sions in leases or other contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or
any Eligible Joint Venture, (viii) any restrictions imposed purs-
uant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of
all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or Property of any
Restricted Subsidiary or Joint Venture that apply pending the
closing of such sale or disposition, (ix) in connection with
Liens on the Property of such Restricted Subsidiary or such
Eligible Joint Venture that are permitted by Section 1012 but
only with respect to transfers referred to in clause (d) of this
Section 1014 or (x) in connection with the Incurrence of any Debt
permitted under clause (ii) of Section 1009(b).

Section 1015. Limitation on Dispositions.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Article Eight, the
Company shall not make and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture to make, any Asset
Disposition unless (i) the Company, the Restricted Subsidiary or
the Eligible Joint Venture, as the case may be, receives
consideration at the time of each such Asset Disposition at least
equal to the fair market value of the Property or securities sold
or otherwise disposed of (to be determined in good faith by the
Chief Financial Officer, as evidenced by an Officers' Certifi-
cate, or, if more than $15 million, by the Board of Directors, as
evidenced by a Board resolution), (ii) at least 85% of such
consideration is received in cash or Cash Equivalents or, if less
than 85%, the remainder of such consideration consists of
Property related to the business of the Company as described in
the first sentence of Section 1022, and (iii) unless otherwise
required under the terms of Senior Debt, at the Company's
election, the Net Cash Proceeds are either (A) invested in the
business of the Company, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or
any Eligible Joint Venture or (B) applied to the payment of any
Debt of the Company or of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or
any Eligible Joint Venture (or as otherwise required under the
terms of such Debt), provided that, no such payment of Debt
(x) under Permitted Working Capital Facilities or any other
revolving credit agreement shall count for this purpose unless
the related loan commitment, standby facility or the like shall
be permanently reduced by an amount equal to the principal amount
so repaid and (y) owed to the Company, a Restricted Subsidiary
thereof or an Eligible Joint Venture shall count for this pur-
pose, provided further that such investment or such payment, as
the case may be, must be made within 365 days from the later of
the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt by the Company,
such Restricted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture of the
Net Cash Proceeds related thereto. Any Net Cash Proceeds from
Asset Dispositions that are not applied as provided in clause (A)
or (B) of the preceding sentence shall constitute "Excess Pro-
ceeds." Excess Proceeds shall be applied, as described below, to
make an offer (an "Excess Proceeds Offer") to purchase Securities
at a purchase price equal to 100% of Accreted Value thereof, plus
accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1015(a),
the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and the Eligible Joint
Ventures may exchange with other Persons (i) Property that con-
stitutes a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture for
Property that constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible
Joint Venture, (ii) Property that constitutes a Restricted
Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture for Property that does
not constitute a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Ven-
ture, (iii) Property that does not constitute a Restricted Sub-
sidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture for Property that does not
constitute a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture
and (iv) Property that does not constitute a Restricted
Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture for Property that consti-
tutes a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture,
provided that in each case the fair market value of the Property
received is at least equal to the fair market value of the
Property exchanged as determined in good faith by the Chief
Financial Officer, as evidenced by an Officers' Certificate, or,
if more than $25 million, by the Board of Directors, as evidenced
by a Board resolution, provided that the Investment in the
Property received in the exchanges described in clauses (ii) and
(iii) of the prior sentence shall be subject to Section 1010. 
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the
Company may not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture to, make an Asset
Disposition of any of their interest in, or Property of, any of
the three geothermal facilities located together at the Naval
Weapons Center at China Lake, California, sometimes referred to
as the "Coso Project," other than for consideration consisting
solely of cash.

(c) To the extent that any or all of the Net Cash Pro-
ceeds of any Foreign Asset Disposition are prohibited from (or
delayed in) being repatriated to the United States by applicable
local law, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected
shall not be required to be applied at the time provided above
but may be retained by any Restricted Subsidiary or any Eligible
Joint Venture so long, but only so long, as the applicable local
law does not permit (or delays) repatriation to the United
States. If such Net Cash Proceeds are transferred by the Re-
stricted Subsidiary or Eligible Joint Venture that conducted the
Foreign Asset Disposition to another Restricted Subsidiary or
Eligible Joint Venture, the Restricted Subsidiary or Eligible
Joint Venture receiving such Net Cash Proceeds must not be
directly or indirectly obligated on any Debt owed to any Person
other than the Company. The Company shall take or cause such Re-
stricted Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture to take all
actions required by the applicable local law to permit such repa-
triation promptly. Once repatriation of any of such Net Cash
Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, repatria-
tion shall be effected immediately and the repatriated Net Cash
Proceeds shall be applied in the manner set forth in this Section
1015(c) as if such Asset Disposition had occurred on the date of
such repatriation. In addition, if the Chief Financial Officer
determines, in good faith, as evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate, that repatriation of any or all of the Net Cash Pro-
ceeds of any Foreign Asset Disposition would have a material
adverse tax consequence to the Company, the Net Cash Proceeds so
affected may be retained outside of the United States by the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary or the applicable Eligible Joint
Venture for so long as such material adverse tax consequence
would continue. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph to the contrary, if applicable local law prohibits (or
delays) the repatriation of Net Cash Proceeds of a Foreign Asset
Disposition but such local law does not prohibit the application
of such Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 1015(a), the Company may apply such Net Cash Proceeds
pursuant to such provision.

(d) If the Securities tendered pursuant to an Excess
Proceeds Offer have an aggregate purchase price that is less than
the Excess Proceeds available for the purchase of the Securities,
the Company may use the remaining Excess Proceeds for general
corporate purposes without regard to the provisions of this
Section 1015(d). The Company shall not be required to make an
Excess Proceeds Offer pursuant to this Section 1015 if the Excess
Proceeds available therefor are less than $10 million, provided
that the lesser amounts of such Excess Proceeds shall be carried
forward and cumulated for each 36 consecutive month period for
purposes of determining whether an Excess Proceeds Offer is re-
quired with respect to any Excess Proceeds of any subsequent
Asset Dispositions. Any such lesser amounts so carried forward
and cumulated need not be segregated or reserved and may be used
for general corporate purposes, provided that such use shall not
reduce the amount of cumulated Excess Proceeds or relieve the
Company of its obligation hereunder to make an Excess Proceeds
Offer with respect thereto.

(e) The Company shall make an Excess Proceeds Offer by
mailing to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, within 30
days after the receipt of Excess Proceeds that cause the cumu-
lated Excess Proceeds to exceed $10 million, a written notice
that shall specify the purchase date, which shall not be less
than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice
(the "Excess Proceeds Purchase Date"), that shall contain certain
information concerning the business of the Company that the
Company believes in good faith shall enable the Holders to make
an informed decision and that shall contain information
concerning the procedures applicable to the Excess Proceeds Offer
(including, without limitation, the right of withdrawal) and the
effect of such offer on the Securities tendered. Holders that
elect to have their Securities purchased shall be required to
surrender such Notes at least one Business Day prior to the
Excess Proceeds Purchase Date. If at the expiration of the
Excess Proceeds Offer period the aggregate purchase price of the
Securities properly tendered by Holders pursuant to the Excess
Proceeds Offer exceeds the amount of such Excess Proceeds, the
Securities or portions of Securities to be accepted for purchase
shall be selected by the Trustee in such manner as the Trustee
deems to be fair and appropriate in the circumstances.

On the Excess Proceeds Purchase Date, the Company shall (i)
accept for payment on a pro rata basis Securities or portions
thereof tendered pursuant to the Excess Proceeds Offer, (ii)
deposit with the Paying Agent money in immediately available
funds sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all the
Securities or portions thereof so accepted and (iii) deliver to
the Trustee Securities so accepted together with an Officers'
Certificate stating the Securities or portions thereof tendered
to the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to the
Holders of each Security so accepted payment in an amount equal
to the aggregate purchase price, and the Trustee shall promptly
authenticate and mail to the Holders of each Security so accepted
payment in an amount equal to the purchase price thereof, and the
Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail to such Holders new
Securities equal in principal amount to any portion of the Secu-
rity surrendered that was not purchased. The Company shall make
a public announcement of the results of the Excess Proceeds Offer
as soon as practicable after the Excess Proceeds Purchase Date. 
For the purposes of this Section 1015, the Trustee shall act as
the Paying Agent.

If the Company is prohibited by applicable law from making
the Excess Proceeds Offer or purchasing Securities thereunder,
the Company need not make an Excess Proceeds Offer pursuant to
this Section 1015 for so long as such prohibition is in effect.

The Company shall comply with all applicable tender offer
rules, including, without limitation, Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, in connection with an Excess Proceeds Offer.

Section 1016. Limitation on Certain Sale-Leasebacks.

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Eligible Joint Venture to, Incur
or otherwise become obligated with respect to any sale-leaseback
(other than a sale-leaseback with respect to a Permitted Facility
that is Non-Recourse) unless, (i) (a) if effected by the Company,
the Company would be permitted to Incur such obligation under
Section 1008 or, (b) if effected by a Restricted Subsidiary or an
Eligible Joint Venture, such Restricted Subsidiary or such
Eligible Joint Venture would be permitted to Incur such obliga-
tion under Section 1009(b), assuming for the purpose of this
Section 1016 and Section 1008 and 1009 that (x) the obligation
created by such sale-leaseback is a Capitalized Lease and (y) the
Capitalized Lease Obligation with respect thereto is the
Attributable Value thereof, (ii) the Company, such Restricted
Subsidiary or such Eligible Joint Venture is permitted to grant a
Lien with respect to the property that is the subject of such
sale-leaseback under Section 1012 of this Indenture, (iii) the
proceeds of such sale-leaseback are at least equal to the fair
market value of the property sold (determined in good faith as
evidenced by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee in
respect of a transaction involving less than $25 million, or, if
equal to or in excess of $25 million, by the Board of Directors,
as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and (iv) the Net Cash
Proceeds of the sale-leaseback are applied pursuant to Section
1015.

Section 1017. Provision of Financial Information.

Whether or not the Company is subject to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or any successor provision thereto,
the Company shall file with the Commission the annual reports,
quarterly reports and other documents that the Company would have
been required to file with the Commission pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d) or any successor provision thereto if the
Company were subject thereto, such documents to be filed with the
Commission on or prior to the respective dates by which the
Company would have been required to file them. The Company shall
also in any event (a) within 15 days of each such date (i)
transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses
appear in the Security Register, without cost to such Holders,
and (ii) file with the Trustee copies of the annual reports,
quarterly reports and other documents (without exhibits) which
the Company would have been required to file with the Commission
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or any
successor provisions thereto if the Company were subject thereto
and (b) if filing such documents by the Company with the
Commission is not permitted under the Exchange Act, promptly upon
written request, supply copies of such documents (without exhib-
its) to any prospective Holder.

Section 1018. Limitation on Sale of Subsidiary Preferred Stock.

The Company shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsid-
iaries or any Eligible Joint Venture to create, assume or other-
wise cause or suffer to exist any Preferred Stock except: (i)
Preferred Stock outstanding on the date of this Indenture,
including Preferred Stock issued as dividends in respect of such
Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of the agreement or instru-
ment that governs such Preferred Stock as in effect on the Issue
Date of the Securities, (ii) Preferred Stock held by the Company,
a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or an Eligible Joint Ven-
ture, (iii) Preferred Stock issued by a Person prior to the time

Restricted Subsidiary or another Eligible Joint Venture or (c) a
Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture merges with or
into such Person (in a transaction in which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture), provided
that such Preferred Stock was not issued in anticipation of such
Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint
Venture or of such merger and (iv) Preferred Stock issued or
agreed to be issued by a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible
Joint Venture in connection with the financing of the construc-
tion, design, engineering, procurement, equipping, developing,

secured by such Permitted Facility or in order to enhance the
repatriation of equity, advances or income or the increase of
after-tax funds available for distribution to the owners of such
Permitted Facility, (v) Preferred Stock issued or agreed to be
issued by a Restricted Subsidiary or an Eligible Joint Venture in
satisfaction of legal requirements applicable to a Permitted
Facility or to maintain the ordinary course of conduct of such
Restricted Subsidiary's or such Eligible Joint Venture's business
in the applicable jurisdiction and (vi) Preferred Stock that is
exchanged for, or the proceeds of which are used to refinance,
any Preferred Stock permitted to be outstanding pursuant to

changed or refinanced and having a redemption period no shorter
than the redemption period of the Preferred Stock so exchanged or
refinanced.

Section 1019. Statement by Officers as to Default; Compliance
Certificates.

(a) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within
120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officers'
Certificate stating that a review of the activities of the
Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and the Eligible Joint
Ventures (signed by a signatory prescribed under the Trust Inden-
ture Act) during the preceding fiscal year has been made under
the supervision of the signing Officers with a view to deter-
mining whether the Company has kept, observed, performed and ful-
filled its obligations under this Indenture and whether the Re-
stricted Subsidiaries and the Eligible Joint Ventures are in com-
pliance with all covenants of this Indenture applicable to them
and further stating, as to each such Officer signing such cer-
tificate, that to the best of his knowledge each has kept,
observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant
contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions, and
conditions hereof (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default
of which he may have knowledge and what action each is taking or
proposes to take with respect thereto).

(b) The Company shall, so long as any of the Securi-
ties are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, forthwith upon any
Officer becoming aware of (i) any Default or Event of Default or
(ii) any event of default under any other mortgage, indenture or

Certificate specifying such Default, Event of Default or other
event of default and what action the Company is taking or
proposes to take with respect thereto.

with any covenant or condition set forth in Section 801, provided
pursuant to Section 901(2) and set forth in Sections 1004 to

condition shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 1021. Company to Supply Information Concerning Original

The Company shall provide to the Trustee on a timely basis
such information as the Trustee requires to enable the Trustee to
prepare and file any form required to be filed with the Internal

original issue discount, including without limitation, Form 1099-
OID or any successor form.

Section 1022. Limitation on Business.

The Company shall, and shall cause its Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Eligible Joint Ventures to, engage only in
(i) the ownership, design, engineering, procurement, construc-
tion, development, acquisition, operation, servicing, management
or disposition of Permitted Facilities, (ii) the ownership, cre-

or an acquisition of Property that is predominantly and directly
related to the business of the Company as described above, and if
the aggregate fair market value of such Ineligible Investments in
the aggregate exceeds 10% (the "10% Limit") of the total assets
of the Company and its consolidated Restricted Subsidiaries (as
determined in accordance with GAAP) as determined in good faith
by the Chief Financial Officer, as evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate, the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and the
Eligible Joint Ventures must cease acquiring any additional
Ineligible Investments and, within 18 months of the acquisition
that caused the Ineligible Assets to exceed the 10% Limit, must
return to compliance with the 10% Limit by disposing of Ineligi-
ble Assets or otherwise, provided that such 18-month period may
be extended up to an additional six months if, despite the
Company's active efforts during such 18-month period to dispose
of such Ineligible Investments or to otherwise come into compli-
ance with such 10% Limit, the Company is unable to do so because
of regulatory restrictions or delays or adverse market condi-
tions.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and each

the Accreted Value of such Securities shall thereupon and
thereafter conclusively be deemed to be their Accreted Value
determined on and as of such Redemption Date and shall not in-
crease. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in
accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the
Company at the Redemption Price, together with any applicable
accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date; provided that

ARTICLE TWELVE

Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

Section 1201. Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance.

The Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have
Section 1202 or Section 1203 applied to the Outstanding Securi-
ties (as a whole and not in part) upon compliance with the condi-
tions set forth below in this Article Twelve. Any such election
shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution.

Section 1202. Defeasance and Discharge.

Upon the Company's exercise of its option to have this
Section 1202 applied to the Outstanding Securities (as a whole
and not in part), the Company shall be deemed to have been
discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities
as provided in this Section 1202 on and after the 123rd day after
the conditions set forth in Section 1204 are satisfied (herein-
after called "Defeasance") (or immediately if an Opinion of
Counsel is delivered to the effect described in clause (C)(y) of
paragraph (2) of Section 1204). For this purpose, such Defea-
sance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities
and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such
Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are con-
cerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall
execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to
the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or
discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such
Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in
Section 1204 and as more fully set forth in such Section, pay-
ments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest
on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's
obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304,
305, 306, 1002, 1003 and 1004 (only with respect to the corporate
existence and rights of the Company), (3) the rights, powers,
trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee under this Inden-
ture, (4) Article Eleven and (5) this Article Twelve. Subject to
compliance with this Article Twelve, the Company may exercise its
option to have this Section 1202 applied to the Outstanding
Securities (as a whole and not in part) notwithstanding the prior
exercise of its option to have Section 1203 applied to such Secu-
rities.

Section 1203. Covenant Defeasance.

Upon the Company's exercise of its option to have this
Section applied to the Outstanding Securities (as a whole and not
in part), (i) the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and its
Eligible Joint Ventures shall be released from its obligations
under Section 801(iii), Sections 1005 through 1018, inclusive,
Section 1022, and any covenant provided pursuant to Section
901(2) and (ii) the occurrence of any event specified in Section
501(1) (solely with respect to Offers to Purchase), Section
501(3), Section 501(4) (with respect to any of Section 801(iii)
and Sections 1005 through 1018, inclusive, Section 1022, and any
such covenants provided pursuant to Section 901(2)), Section
501(5) or Section 501(6) shall be deemed not to be or result in
an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities
as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions
set forth in Section 1204 are satisfied (hereinafter called
"Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defea-
sance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company
may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of
any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified
Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Sections
501(1) and 501(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of
any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason
of any reference in any such Section to any other provision
herein or in any other document; but the remainder of this
Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.

Section 1204. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

The following shall be the conditions to the application of
Section 1202 or Section 1203 to the Outstanding Securities:

(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee that
satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees
to comply with the provisions of this Article applicable to it)
as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following
payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated
solely to the benefits of the Holders of such Securities, (A)
money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations that
through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in
respect thereof in accordance with their terms shall provide, not
later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in
an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient,
in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof
delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall
be applied by the Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee)
to pay and discharge, the principal of, premium if any and any
installment of accrued interest on such Securities on the
respective Stated Maturities thereof or, if the Company makes ar-
rangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of the
Securities prior to their Stated Maturity, on any earlier Redemp-
tion Date, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and
such Securities.

(2) In the event of an election to have Section 1202
apply to the Outstanding Securities, the Company shall have
delivered to the Trustee (A) either (X) an Opinion of Counsel to
the effect that Holders shall not recognize income, gain or loss
for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit,
defeasance and discharge and shall be subject to federal income
tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and
discharge had not occurred and the Company had paid or redeemed
such Securities on the applicable dates, which Opinion of Counsel
must be based upon a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service to
the same effect or a change in applicable federal income tax law
or related Treasury regulations after the date of the Indenture
or (y) a ruling directed to the Trustee or the Company received
from the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect as the
aforementioned Opinion of Counsel, (B) an Opinion of Counsel to
the effect that the creation of the defeasance trust does not
violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and (C) an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that either (x) after the passage of 123
days following the deposit, the trust fund shall not be subject
to the effect of Section 547 or 548 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or Section 15 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law or (y)
based upon existing precedents, if the manner were properly
briefed, a court should hold that the deposit of moneys and/or
U.S. Government Obligations as provided in Section 1204(1) would
not constitute a preference voidable under Section 547 or 548 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Section 15 of the New York Debtor and
Creditor Law.

(3) In the event of an election to have Section 1203
apply to the Outstanding Securities, the Company shall have
delivered to the Trustee (i) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities shall not recog-
nize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a
result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with
respect to such Securities and shall be subject to Federal income
tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times
as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were
not to occur and the Company had paid or redeemed such Securities
on the applicable dates, (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that the creation of the defeasance trust does not violate the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and (iii) an Opinion of Counsel to
the effect that either (x) after the passage of 123 days
following the deposit, the trust fund shall not be subject to the
effect of Section 547 or 548 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
Section 15 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law or (y) based
upon existing precedents, if the manner were properly briefed, a
court should hold that the deposit of moneys and/or U.S.
Government Obligations as provided in Section 1204(1) would not
constitute a preference voidable under Section 547 or 548 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Section 15 of the New York Debtor and
Creditor Law.

(4) Immediately after giving effect to such deposit on
a pro forma basis, no Default or Event of Default or event that
after the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become
an Event of Default, with respect to the Outstanding Securities
shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit
or (unless an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the effect de-
scribed in Section 1204(2)(C)(y) or 1204(3)(iii)(y)) during the
period ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit.

(5) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not
cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the
meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are
in default within the meaning of such Act).

(6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not
result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default
under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is
a party or by which it is bound.

(7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not
result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an
investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, unless such trust shall be registered
under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder.

(8) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

(9) If the Securities are listed on a national
securities exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securities
shall not be delisted as a result of such deposit, defeasance and
discharge.

Section 1205. Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to
Be Held in Trust; Miscellaneous Provisions.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section
1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the
proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying
trustee (solely for purposes of this Section 1205 and Section
1206, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to
collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1204 or
otherwise in respect of the Outstanding Securities shall be held
in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the
provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment,
either directly or through any such Paying Agent (other than the
Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may deter-
mine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to
become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and
interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from
other funds except to the extent required by law.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any
tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S.
Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1204 or the
principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any
such tax, fee or other charge that by law is for the account of
the Holders of Outstanding Securities.

Anything in this Article Twelve to the contrary notwith-
standing, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from
time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government
Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1204 that, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants expressed in a written certification thereof deliv-
ered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof that
would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance
or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to the
Outstanding Securities.

Section 1206. Reinstatement.

If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any
money in accordance with this Article Twelve with respect to any
Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this
Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been
discharged or released pursuant to Section 1202 or 1203 shall be
revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant
to this Article Twelve with respect to such Securities, until
such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply
all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1205 with respect to
such Securities in accordance with this Article Twelve; provided
that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any
premium or interest on any such Security following such rein-
statement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to
the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive
such payment from the money so held in trust.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counter-
parts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an origi-
nal, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one
and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Indenture to be duly executed, and their respective corporate
seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day and
year first above written.
