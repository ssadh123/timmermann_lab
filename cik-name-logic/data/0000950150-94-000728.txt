Item 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On October 27, 1994 (the "Closing Date"), Rykoff-Sexton, Inc.
("Rykoff") sold all of the outstanding capital stock of Tone
Brothers, Inc., an Iowa corporation ("Tone"), to Burns Philp
Food Inc., a California corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Burns Philp & Company Limited ("Burns"),
pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated September 8, 1994
(the "Agreement"). Tone is a processor and marketer of
spices, extracts and food colorings. As a result of the sale
of Tone, self-manufactured sales of Rykoff will now represent
approximately 13.4% of net sales compared to the historical
rate of approximately 18% for the fiscal year ended April 30,
1994.

On the Closing Date, Rykoff received $96,000,000 in cash from
Burns in payment of the purchase price and subject to certain
post-closing purchase price adjustments. The proceeds will be
used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Company's
bank credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.

The terms of the sale are more fully described in the
Agreement, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit hereto.

PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF INCOME
(UNAUDITED)
EXPLANATION OF ADJUSTMENTS

(1) These adjustments have been made to reflect the interest savings that
Rykoff would have earned had Tone been sold at the beginning of each
of the respective periods for which the pro forma statements of income
have been presented. The reduction in interest expense results from
the elimination of borrowings under the bank credit line, interest
earned on excess funds received on the sale of Tone, net of
capitalized interest and interest expense related to additional
borrowings without Tone's cash flows.

(2) To adjust for the tax effect of the interest expense adjustment in
note (1) above.

(3) To adjust for intercompany sales elimination.

-5-
<PAGE> 30
afford the Seller and Arthur Andersen & Co. without charge the assistance of
the Corporation's employees and access to the Corporation's facilities, books,
records, work papers and computations to the extent necessary in order to
prepare the Closing Date Balance Sheet. Within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's
receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Buyer shall notify Seller of any
items of dispute with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet. In the event
that Buyer disputes any items with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
within thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
Buyer shall (a) obtain a letter from KPMG Peat Marwick LLP ("KPMG") (after
their review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the supporting work papers
and schedules) which indicates KPMG's concurrence with respect to such items of
dispute and their effect on the Purchase Price calculation as proposed by Buyer
and (b) shall notify Seller of the contents of such letter. If the parties are
unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within fifteen (15) days of
Seller's receipt of the notification described in the preceding sentence,
either party may refer such dispute for final and conclusive determination to
Deloitte & Touche at 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, and such
determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after such referral.
Seller and Buyer shall bear equally the expenses arising in connection with
such determination. Seller and Buyer and their respective agents and
representatives shall have complete access to the work papers and schedules
relating to the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet or any dispute in
connection therewith of Arthur Andersen & Co., Deloitte & Touche, and any other
accounting firm employed in connection with the preparation of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet. If the Purchase Price exceeds ninety six million dollars
($96,000,000), then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the difference between
the Purchase Price and ninety six million dollars ($96,000,000); if the
Purchase Price is less than ninety six million dollars ($96,000,000), then the
Seller shall pay to the Buyer the difference (any such payment by Buyer or
Seller, a "Payment Adjustment"). Any payment required to be made pursuant to
this Section 1.5 shall be made within sixteen (16) days of the delivery of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet to the Buyer by wire transfer of same day U.S.
Dollar funds to an account designated by the recipient; provided, however, that
in the event Buyer disputes the Purchase Price determined by the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, then (X) in the case where the parties agree that the Purchase
Price either exceeds or is less than the $96,000,000, the party making the
Payment Adjustment shall pay to the other party only that portion of the
Payment Adjustment as to which the parties agree and shall deposit the balance
of the Payment Adjustment into escrow, and (Y) in the case where the Purchase
Price based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds $96,000,000, and Buyer
asserts that the Purchase Price is less than $96,000,000, then Seller shall
deposit into escrow the amount by which Buyer's asserted Purchase Price is less
than $96,000,000, and Buyer shall deposit into escrow an amount by which the
Purchase Price based on the Closing Date

-6-
<PAGE> 31
Balance Sheet exceeds $96,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
party shall be obligated in any event to deposit more than five million dollars
($5,000,000) into escrow. All amounts paid into escrow shall be deposited
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
Schedule 1.5. If the amount deposited into escrow (together with the interest
accrued thereon pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) by either party is less than
the amount necessary to fully pay the amount finally determined to be due to
the other party by Deloitte & Touche, the party obligated to pay shall pay the
amount of such shortfall to the other party within five (5) days of final
determination by Deloitte & Touche by wire transfer of same day U.S. Dollar
funds to an account designated by the recipient. Any amounts paid (or
deposited into escrow) by either party pursuant to the terms hereof shall
include interest on such amounts from the Closing Date to the date of such
payment (or the deposit of such funds into escrow) at a rate per annum equal to
the rate offered for deposits of U.S. Dollars for three-month periods in
amounts substantially similar to the amounts due hereunder by prime banks in
the London Interbank Eurocurrency Market on or about 11:00 A.M. London time on
the Closing Date, plus one and one-half percent (1.5%).

1.6 Post-Closing Increase of Purchase Price if Section 338
Elections Occur.

(a) 338 Elections. At its option, Buyer may make an election
under Code Section 338 (or any successor provision thereof and any comparable
provision of state or local law) ("Buyer's 338 Election") with respect to its
purchase of the Shares from Seller; provided, however, that Buyer's 338
Election shall be made, if at all, within the period permitted under the Code
(the "Election Period").

If Buyer decides to make Buyer's 338 Election, Buyer shall deliver a
copy of the proposed Buyer's 338 Election to Seller no later than fifteen (15)
days before the end of the Election Period, by air courier or other method of
personal delivery, and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully and each shall
take all actions necessary for Seller to make (within the Election Period) a
corresponding election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (or any successor
provision thereof and any comparable provision of state or local law) with
respect to Buyer's purchase of the Shares from Seller ("Seller's 338 Election")
(together with the Buyer's 338 Election, referred to herein as the "Joint 338
Election"); provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to execute and
deliver the Joint 338 Election to Buyer unless and until Buyer shall have paid
to Seller the present value of the estimated amount of Seller's Additional
Taxes determined under the first paragraph of Section 1.6(b), discounted at the
rate of interest set forth in Section 1.5, in effect as of the date of such
payment, for the period of time between the payment date and the due date
(without any extensions) for the filing of Seller's consolidated federal income
tax return for the taxable

-7-
<PAGE> 32
year in which the sale of Shares takes place, and such payment shall be made in
the manner provided in Section 1.6(c). If such payment is made by Buyer,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer the Joint 338 Election at least five (5) days
before the end of the Election Period, and Buyer shall then file the Joint 338
Election before the end of the Election Period.

(b) Calculation of Seller's Additional Taxes. Within thirty (30)
days after the Purchase Price is finally determined under Section 1.5, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement containing Seller's good faith
estimate of the net amount of additional Taxes and Related Costs (after taking
into account the net effect of Taxes and such Related Costs that are deductible
in the calculation of Taxes) that, if the Joint 338 Election is made and the
Buyer's payments (net of any refunds made by Seller to Buyer) under this
Section 1.6 are also made, would ultimately be incurred by Seller and the
Corporation (to the extent Seller is responsible hereunder or otherwise for
payment of such Taxes) solely as a result of the Joint 338 Election and Buyer's
net payments to Seller under this Section 1.6, but only to the extent the Taxes
and Related Costs so incurred would exceed the Taxes and Related Costs that
would be incurred in the absence of the Joint 338 Election and such payments by
Buyer (the total amount of such additional Taxes and Related Costs is herein
referred to as "Seller's Additional Taxes"). Schedule 1.6 contains the general
method and formula for calculation of Seller's Additional Taxes; provided,
however, that such method and formula shall be subject to refinement for the
purpose of increasing the accuracy of such calculation.

If the Joint 338 Election is made within the Election Period, then by
no later than fifteen (15) days before the due date (as duly extended) for the
filing of Seller's consolidated federal income tax return for the taxable year
in which the sale of Shares takes place, Seller shall calculate the amount of
Seller's Additional Taxes, based on the facts to be shown on or underlying that
return (and any state and local Tax Returns affected by the sale) and Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a revised statement of Seller's Additional Taxes.

Furthermore, if the Taxes of Seller or the Corporation (to the extent
Seller is responsible hereunder or otherwise for payment of such Taxes) are
finally adjusted at any time by a government agency or court of competent
jurisdiction in any manner that would affect the amount of Seller's Additional
Taxes, Seller shall re-calculate Seller's Additional Taxes based on that
adjustment and deliver to Buyer a revised statement of Seller's Additional
Taxes, within fifteen (15) days after Seller receives written notice of the
final Tax adjustment described above. If Seller reasonably anticipates that a
proposed adjustment of the Taxes of Seller or Corporation would result in an
increase of Seller's Additional Taxes payable by Buyer under Section 1.6(c),
and such increase would exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), Seller
shall notify Buyer of such

-8-
<PAGE> 33
proposed adjustment and provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to assist
(at Buyer's own expense) in the defense and settlement of such adjustment;
provided, however, that Seller shall not settle either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any such proposed adjustment without
Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In the event that Buyer does not consent to a settlement proposed in
good faith by Seller, Seller may tender the defense of such proposed adjustment
to Buyer, which shall continue such defense at its own expense, keeping Seller
advised as to all steps taken by Buyer in such defense; and Buyer shall
indemnify Seller for any Taxes and Related Costs imposed upon Seller (under
this Agreement or otherwise) as a result of such adjustment, to the extent such
amounts exceed the amounts of Taxes and Related Costs that would have been
imposed on Seller if such settlement had been accepted by the applicable taxing
authority as of the date such settlement proposal was tendered to Buyer by
Seller.

Each statement of Seller's Additional Taxes shall be prepared in
reasonable detail sufficient to permit Buyer to verify the accuracy of the
calculations and shall be accompanied by a certification by an officer of
Seller that, to the best knowledge of Seller, the facts supporting the
calculation are true and correct. Each such statement shall be delivered by
air courier or other method of personal delivery.

Within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's receipt of any estimated or
revised statement of Seller's Additional Taxes, Buyer shall notify Seller in
writing of any items of dispute with respect to the statement. If the parties
are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within the fifteen (15)
day period after Seller's receipt of such notice, either party may refer such
dispute for determination to Deloitte & Touche at 50 Fremont Street, San
Francisco, CA 94105, and such determination shall be made within thirty (30)
days after such referral. Buyer shall bear the expenses arising in connection
with such determination; provided, however, that such determination shall be
without prejudice to the recalculation of Seller's Additional Taxes
contemplated in the second preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
payments or refunds of Taxes taken into account in the determination of
Seller's Additional Taxes shall be conclusive and not subject to dispute to the
extent the amount of such Taxes is no longer subject to adjustment by the
applicable taxing authority.

(c) Other Payment Procedures. If the amount of Seller's
Additional Taxes is increased in any revised statement of Seller's Additional
Taxes, as determined under Section 1.6(b), Buyer shall pay the amount of the
increase to Seller in the manner provided below. If the amount of Seller's
Additional Taxes is decreased in any revised statement of Seller's Additional
Taxes, as determined under Section 1.6(b), Seller

-9-
<PAGE> 34
shall pay the amount of such decrease to Buyer in the manner provided below.

Any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be
made by wire transfer. Any payment resulting from a revised statement of
Seller's Additional Taxes shall be made within fifteen (15) days of delivery of
such statement.

(d) Allocation of Section 338 Purchase Price. If the Joint 338
Election is made within the Election Period, Buyer shall allocate the Section
338 Purchase Price among the various categories of assets, as set forth in a
schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") delivered by Buyer to Seller within the
Election Period. Whenever the amount of Seller's Additional Taxes is
redetermined pursuant to Section 1.6(b), Buyer shall revise the Allocation
Schedule and deliver a copy to Seller within fifteen (15) days of such final
determination.

Within fifteen (15) days of Seller's receipt of the initial or any
revised Allocation Schedule, Seller shall notify Buyer of any items of dispute
with respect to the Allocation Schedule. If the parties are unable to resolve
the dispute through negotiation within the fifteen (15) day period after
Seller's receipt of such schedule, either party may refer such dispute for a
final resolution under the procedures described in Section 1.5.

If the Joint 338 Election is made within the Election Period, each
party shall provide its federal taxpayer identification number to the other
party and (for purposes of state and federal Taxes) each of the parties agrees
to report the sale of Shares under this Agreement in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule (as revised through the date of filing of the relevant
return for changes in the amount of Seller's Additional Taxes pursuant to
Section 1.6(b)), and such reports shall also be consistent with the Joint 338
Election.

Corporation.

represent and warrant to the Buyer as follows:

sales, operations or assets, have been or will be properly and correctly
completed and filed on a timely basis. All such Tax Returns were or will be
correct and complete in all respects.

(b) All Taxes whether or not shown on any Tax Return required to be
paid or to be withheld and remitted by the Corporation (including, without
limitation, all Taxes required to be withheld and remitted in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any shareholder, employee, creditor, independent
contractor or other third party) have been duly and timely paid in full or
properly withheld and remitted. There has not been communicated to Seller or
the Corporation the assertion of any claim with respect to any Taxes required
to be paid or withheld by or on behalf of the Corporation and there are no
encumbrances upon any of its property or assets that arose in connection with
any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Taxes other than liens for current
property taxes not yet due.

(c) Schedule 2.14 lists those states where the Corporation has filed
or, to the best knowledge of Seller or the Corporation, is required to file a
Tax Return. No claim which remains outstanding has ever been made to Seller or
the Corporation by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the

-14-
<PAGE> 39
Corporation does not file a Tax Return that the Corporation is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction due to its activities or business.

(d) All Taxes attributable to the Corporation's operations through
and including the Closing Date, but for which no Tax Return is yet required,
will be paid as provided in Sections 5.11 and 8.4.

(e) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.14, no extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return has been requested with respect to or by or
granted to the Corporation, except with respect to Tax Returns that were
subsequently filed or Tax Returns specified on Schedule 2.14 as not yet filed
but otherwise due.

(f) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.14, no restrictions on
assessment or collection of Taxes have been waived with respect to the
Corporation and neither Seller, the Corporation nor any other person has
consented to or requested the extension of any statute of limitations relating
to Taxes.

(g) Except for Tax Returns for the taxable years listed on Schedule
2.14, the Corporation has not been audited by any relevant taxing authority
(other than audits that have been completed), the Corporation remains subject
to audit in every taxing jurisdiction except as provided otherwise by
applicable statutes of limitation, and no notification of intention to audit or
examine has been received from the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
authority with respect to the Taxes of the Corporation. Any deficiencies
resulting from such audits have been paid in full. No issue was raised by any
taxing authority and communicated to Seller or the Corporation with respect to
any such audit that, if raised with respect to any Tax Return filed for a
subsequent taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, could result
in a deficiency of Taxes or other adjustment for such subsequent period. No
unsatisfied deficiency, delinquency, or default for any Taxes has been proposed
to or assessed against the Corporation nor has it received notice of any such
deficiency, delinquency or default. No currently pending issues have been
raised by any taxing authority and communicated to Seller or the Corporation in
connection with any Tax Return relating to Taxes of the Corporation. There are
no Tax rulings, requests for rulings or closing agreements relating to the
Corporation in which either Seller or the Corporation is explicitly named that
could affect their liability for Taxes for any period after the Closing Date.

(h) Seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section
1445 of the Code.

(i) Seller has not filed any consent under Code section 341(f) with

any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it to make any
payments (including, without limitation, any payments that have been or will be
made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) that
will not be deductible by virtue of Code Section 280G. There has been
adequately disclosed in the federal income Tax Returns filed by the Corporation
or in the filing of which the Corporation has joined all positions taken
therein with respect to the income, assets, business or operations of the
Corporation which otherwise could give rise to a substantial understatement of
federal Taxes within the meaning of Code Section 6662.

(j) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.14, the Corporation has neither
agreed nor been required to make an adjustment under section 481 of the Code by
reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise. No material taxable
income economically attributable to transactions occurring on or before the
Closing Date will be required to be recognized by the Corporation after the
Closing Date, whether by reason of it reporting income on the cash method of
accounting, the completed contract method, the percentage of
completion-capitalized cost method, the installment method of accounting or by
reason of Income Tax Regulations section 1.1502-13 (deferred intercompany
transactions) or 1.1502-19 (excess losses) or otherwise.

to the Corporation as of the most recent practicable date (as well as on an

party to any allocation or sharing arrangement or agreement (whether written or

payable thereunder shall either be paid prior to the Closing Date or properly
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

compliance with all statutes, orders, rules, ordinances, charters and by-laws 
and regulations applicable to it or to the ownership of its assets or the 
operation of its business, except for any failure to do so which would not 
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Corporation. The Corporation is not 
subject to any judicial injunction or mandate or any quasi-judicial order or 
quasi-judicial restriction directed to or against it, nor has any governmental
agency at any time challenged the Corporation in writing or commenced or given
notice to the Corporation of intention to commence any investigation or 
administrative proceeding, relating to the legal right to operate its business
as presently or heretofore operated, except to the extent that any of the 
foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Corporation. To the
best knowledge of the Seller and the Corporation, except as otherwise 
disclosed pursuant to Schedule 2.15, there are no (a) consumer, customer or 
distributor complaints or regulatory complaints or investigations relating to 
the Corporation's business, nor is there the basis for any such complaint or 
(b) claims which Seller has put in the hands of its insurance carriers since 
January 1, 1992 seeking damages for personal or other injuries or loss 
resulting from the manufacture, sale or use of any of the products 
manufactured or sold by the Corporation, except to the extent that any of the 
foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Corporation. Except
as disclosed in Schedule 2.15, the Corporation knows of no strikes, work 
stoppages undertaken or threatened or demands for recognition or petitions for
representation since January 1, 1992 by any of the employees of the

of them is bound or result in the creation of any lien, claim, encumbrance or

investigation relating to potential violations by Corporation of environmental
laws as a result of the Corporation's use, maintenance or operation of any of
its assets or its business, except for any such matter as could not reasonably

sufficient to meet the Corporation's requirements in the ordinary course of
business as generally conducted by the Corporation prior to the Closing, except
to the extent of variations caused by events beyond the Corporation's or
Seller's control. Except for items undergoing routine rework, items not
salable in the normal course of business (including but not limited to
discontinued items, damaged goods or items not meeting quality assurance
guidelines), shall be accounted for in the Closing Date Balance Sheet at their
net realizable value in accordance with GAAP. Items shall be deemed "Aged" if,
as of the end of the fiscal month immediately preceding the Closing Date (or as
of the Closing Date if the Closing Date coincides with the last day of a fiscal
month), they have a remaining shelf life of less than six (6) months according
to Schedule 2.37. Such items deemed "Aged" shall be accounted for at no value.
After the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Corporation to either (i) deliver to
Seller the proceeds from the sale of the "Aged" inventory, net of all selling
and administrative expenses relating to such sale, or (ii) deliver the "Aged"
inventory to Seller at Seller's direction and at Seller's expense. Items shall
be deemed "Excess" if, as of the end of the fiscal month immediately preceding
the Closing Date (or as of the Closing Date if the Closing Date coincides with
the last day of a fiscal month), there is more than twenty-four (24) months
supply on hand in the Corporation's inventory unless reasonably economical
minimum orders are for greater than twenty-four (24) months supply. The amount
deemed "Excess" shall be accounted for at salvage value. Packaging materials
will be valued at cost except that no value shall be attributable to packaging
not usable in the normal course of business (e.g., damaged, obsolete,
discontinued, faded or shaded) or packaging not meeting current FDA
requirements. All raw materials and goods-in-process shall be suitable and
processable for the production of products in accordance with the Corporation's
standard quality and yield specifications as now in effect. Raw

combined, unitary or other similar filing group of Seller or any successor to
Seller ("Seller's Group") or to a separate return of a member of any Seller's
Group and (iii) as a result of such carryback Seller or any member of Seller's
Group becomes entitled to and receives a refund of any Taxes for any period for

resulting from Seller's activities under this Section 5.11(f) but only at the

indemnification obligation or (ii) Buyer obtains Seller's prior written
consent, which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

their respective affiliates to, use its best efforts to provide each other with

aggregate, which arise out of or in connection with: (i) the inaccuracy of any
of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, or
any certificate or agreement delivered pursuant hereto or (ii) the breach by
Seller of any of the covenants made by it in this Agreement. Neither Buyer nor
the Corporation shall be deemed to have sustained a loss to the extent it is
entitled to be indemnified by insurance carried by Buyer or the Corporation, or
would have been entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation's insurance if
the insurance carried by the Corporation as of the Effective Date had remained
in effect until the loss occurs. The Seller's liability under this paragraph
shall not, however, exceed the aggregate amount of $25,000,000. In computing
the amount to be paid by the Seller under this paragraph, there shall be
deducted an amount equal to any Tax benefits realized by the Buyer, or the
Corporation (or their successors, assigns or affiliates), as a result of the
event giving rise to Seller's obligation to make such payment, after taking
into account the income tax treatment of the Buyer's receipt of such payment.
The Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller of the existence of any claim or
other matter to which the Seller's indemnification obligations would apply.
Immediately upon Seller being notified of a claim by a third party (other than
a taxing authority) that may result in indemnification, Seller shall have the
right, but not the duty, to compromise or defend any such claim through counsel
of the Seller's choice and at the expense of the Seller. The notice and
opportunity to compromise or defend such claim, if applicable, shall be a
condition precedent to any liability of the Seller. In the event that the
Seller undertakes to compromise or defend such claim, the Seller shall notify
the Buyer of the Seller's intention to do so, and in such event the Buyer shall
cooperate fully with the Seller. If the Seller does not undertake to
compromise or defend such claim after notification, the Buyer may compromise or
defend any such matter through counsel of the Buyer's choice and at the
Seller's expense. In no event shall Seller be liable for any indirect,
incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of any circumstance
which gives rise to an indemnification obligation of Seller hereunder. The
indemnification contemplated in Section 8.4 hereof relating to Taxes, the
indemnification contemplated in Section 5.14 hereof relating to the BA Lease,
and any indemnification resulting from the breach of the

-38-
<PAGE> 63
representation and warranty in Section 2.26 hereof relating to the CEBA
Agreement shall not be subject to the dollar limitations or minimums set forth
herein.

8.2 Indemnification by the Buyer. The Buyer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Seller and its affiliates, shareholders, officers and
employees from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, losses,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) in excess of three hundred thousand dollars (US $300,000) in the
aggregate, which arise out of or in connection with: (i) the inaccuracy of any
of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement, or
any document, certificate or agreement delivered pursuant hereto; or (ii) the
breach by Buyer of any of the covenants made by it in this Agreement. The
Buyer's liability under this paragraph shall not, however, exceed the aggregate
amount of $25,000,000. In computing the amount to be paid by the Buyer under
this paragraph, there shall be deducted an amount equal to any Tax benefits
realized by the Seller (or its successors, assigns or affiliates) as a result
of the event giving rise to Buyer's obligation to make such payment, after
taking into account the income tax treatment of the Seller's receipt of these
payments. The Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer of the existence of any
claim or other matter to which the Buyer's indemnification obligations would
apply. Seller shall not be deemed to have sustained the loss to the extent it
is entitled to be indemnified by its insurance. Immediately upon Buyer being
notified of the claim by a third party (other than a taxing authority) that may
result in indemnification, Buyer shall have the right, but not the duty, to
compromise or defend any such claim through counsel of the Buyer's choice and
at the expense of the Buyer. The notice and opportunity to compromise or
defend such claim, if applicable, shall be a condition precedent to any
liability of the Buyer. In the event that the Buyer undertakes to compromise
or defend such claim, the Buyer shall notify the Seller of the Buyer's
intention to do so and in such event, the Seller shall cooperate fully with the
Buyer. If the Buyer does not undertake to compromise or defend such claim
after notification, the Seller may compromise or defend any such matter through
counsel of the Seller's choice and at the Buyer's expense. In no event shall
Buyer be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
arising out of any circumstances which give rise to an indemnification
obligation of Buyer hereunder. The indemnification contemplated in Section 8.4
hereof relating to Taxes, the indemnification contemplated in Section 1.6(b)
relating to Buyer's settlement of certain Tax disputes, the indemnification
contemplated in Section 5.14 hereof relating to the BA Lease, and the
indemnification contemplated in Section 5.12 relating to the Sysco Litigation
shall not be subject to the dollar limitations or minimums set forth herein.

8.3 Survival of Indemnification. The right to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4 of this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date for a period with respect to Tax matters, equal to the
applicable statutory limitation period for the applicable Tax Returns required
to be filed for taxable years or periods for which indemnification is due
hereunder, with respect to environmental matters under Section 2.19, equal to
three (3) years and with respect to all other matters, equal to two (2) years.
The last day of each such period shall be, with respect to the applicable
matter, referred to herein as the "Applicable Claim Termination Date." No
claim or action for indemnification under this Agreement shall be asserted or
maintained by any party hereto after the Applicable Claim Termination Date
except that if there shall be pending on the Applicable Claim Termination Date
any claim asserted by a party in writing to the party alleged to be responsible
for such claim under this Article 8, on or prior to the Applicable Claim
Termination Date, then the party asserting that claim shall thereafter have the
right to continue to assert that claim and to be indemnified with respect
thereto, if due under this Article 8.

8.4 Taxes.

(a) Seller shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, its affiliates and their directors, officers, agents and
representatives on an after-tax basis from and against (i) any and all Taxes
and Related Costs of the Corporation (or any predecessor thereto) for any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion of
any and all Taxes and Related Costs for any taxable year or period beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date that is attributable to the portion of
such year or period through the Closing Date (in each case, except to the
extent that such liability is properly reflected as a current liability in the
Closing Date Balance Sheet), (ii) any and all Taxes and Related Costs (for any
taxable period, whether beginning before, on or after the Closing Date) of or
attributable to any person, other than the Corporation, Buyer and Buyer's
affiliates, which is or has been affiliated with the Corporation or with which
the Corporation files or has filed any combined, consolidated or unitary or
other similar Tax Return, (iii) any and all Taxes and Related Costs imposed on
account of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the election contemplated by Section 1.6); provided that nothing in
this Section 8.4(a) shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations under Section
1.6); and (iv) the inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties of
Seller or Corporation contained in this Agreement related to Taxes. In
computing the amount to be paid by the Seller under this paragraph, there shall
be deducted an amount equal to any Tax benefits realized by the Buyer, or the
Corporation (or their successors, assigns or affiliates), as a result of the
event giving rise to Seller's obligation to make such payment, after taking
into account the

-40-
<PAGE> 65
income tax treatment of the Buyer's receipt of such payment. In no event shall
Seller be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
arising out of any circumstance which gives rise to an indemnification
obligation of Seller hereunder.

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, its affiliates and their directors, officers, agents and
representatives on an after-tax basis from and against any and all Taxes and
Related Costs of the Corporation (or any predecessor thereto) for any taxable
year or period beginning after the Closing Date and the portion of any and all
Taxes and Related Costs for any taxable year or period beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date that is attributable to the portion of such year
or period beginning after the Closing Date. In computing the amount to be paid
by the Buyer under this paragraph, there shall be deducted an amount equal to
any Tax benefits realized by the Seller (or its successors, assigns or
affiliates) as a result of the event giving rise to Buyer's obligation to make
such payment, after taking into account the income tax treatment of the
Seller's receipt of these payments. In no event shall Buyer be liable for any
indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of any
circumstances which give rise to an indemnification obligation of Buyer
hereunder.

(c) Except as provided in Section 5.11(c), if any Tax for which
one party (the "Tax Indemnitor") is to indemnify the other (the "Tax
Indemnitee") pursuant to this Section 8.4 is payable (whether as a payment of
estimated Tax, in satisfaction of a deficiency or otherwise) after the Closing
Date, the Tax Indemnitor shall pay or cause to be paid to the Tax Indemnitee
the amount of such Tax no later than the later of (i) the tenth business day
after the Tax Indemnitor receives notice from the Tax Indemnitee that such Tax
is due and (ii) ten business days before the date such Tax is due and payable.

9. Termination.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

(a) Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated by
the mutual consent of the parties hereto. The parties agree that this
Agreement shall be deemed terminated by the mutual consent of the
parties if, at or before 1:00 P.M. on Tuesday, September 13, 1994,
Buyer shall have delivered a notice to Seller to the effect that the
Agreement is so terminated based upon Buyer's due diligence review of
the Corporation's customer relationship with Sam's Warehouse Club
proving unsatisfactory to Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion.

-41-
<PAGE> 66
(b) Default. If, notwithstanding the terms of this
Agreement, a party hereto shall intentionally fail or refuse to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein or otherwise fail to
perform its obligations hereunder, then the nondefaulting party, after
affording the defaulting party a ten (10) day period after notice in
which to cure such breach or default, shall have the right, to
terminate this Agreement by written notice given to the other party
hereto.

(c) Upset Date. If the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before October 31, 1994 then, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing between the parties hereto, this Agreement may be terminated
by either party at any time upon notice to the other party; provided,
however, that the conduct or failure to act by the party electing to
terminate this Agreement shall not have prevented the Closing from
occurring.

(d) Legal Restraint. Any party may, by written notice to
the other party, terminate this Agreement if at the time the written
notice of termination is given, there is in effect a permanent
injunction enjoining the transaction contemplated hereunder.

10. Miscellaneous.

10.1 Parties and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns; provided, however, that this Agreement may not be
assigned by any party without the consent of the other parties hereto, except
that the Buyer may designate a wholly owned subsidiary as the purchaser of the
Shares, but such designation shall not relieve the Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any person
or entity not a party to this Agreement (other than the legal representatives
and agents of the parties to this Agreement) any rights, remedies of any nature
or kind whatsoever, and no such person or entity shall be construed to be a
third party beneficiary or shall be entitled to rely upon any provision of this
Agreement or any agreement, instrument, certificate or document executed
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement.

10.2 Confidentiality; Press Releases. Except as otherwise required by
law, from and after the Effective Date and until the Closing Date each of the
parties hereto agrees that all press releases and other announcements, whether
written or oral, to be made by any of them with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be subject to the agreement and consent of all
parties hereto prior to the dissemination thereof. Until the Closing Date,

Agreement.

and Exhibits hereto, sets forth the parties' final and entire agreement with
respect to its subject matter and supersedes any and all understandings and

respective terms.

10.8 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Agreement

unenforceable term or provision, the parties hereto intend that there shall be
added as a part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be valid and

10.10 Convenience of Forums; Consent to Jurisdiction. The parties to
this Agreement, acting for themselves and for their respective successors and
assigns, without regard to domicile, citizenship or residence, hereby agree to
submit themselves to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of California located in San Francisco, the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California, in respect of any matter arising under
this Agreement. Service of process, notices and demands of such courts may be
made upon any party to this Agreement by personal service at any place where it
may be found or by giving notice to such party herein.

10.11 Resolution of Disputes.

(a) Negotiation Between Executives. The parties shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
or the breach, termination or validity thereof, by negotiations between
executives who have authority to settle the controversy. Any party may give
the other party written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course
of business. Within 20 days after delivery of

-44-
<PAGE> 69
such notice, executives of both parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable
time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to
exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the dispute. If the
matter has not been resolved within 60 days of the disputing party's notice, or
if the parties fail to meet within 20 days, either party may initiate
arbitration of the controversy or claim as provided hereinafter.

If a negotiator intends to be accompanied at a meeting by an attorney,
the other negotiator shall be given at least three working days' notice of such
intention and may also be accompanied by an attorney. All negotiations
pursuant to this clause are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and
settlement negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and state
rules of evidence.

(a) Arbitration. If a dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof, has not been
resolved by negotiation as provided herein, it shall be settled by arbitration
in accordance with the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute
Resolution Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes. The
arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, shall be governed by
the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section Section 1-16, and judgment

jurisdiction thereof.

notice to the other (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other actions of the other; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations or warranties of the other contained in this Agreement; (c)
waive performance of any of the covenants or obligations of the other created
under this Agreement; or (d) waive fulfillment of any of the conditions to its
own obligations under this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as
a waiver of any subsequent breach, whether or not similar, and shall not
constitute a waiver by either party of any rights or remedies under this
Agreement or otherwise in law or equity. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented only by a written instrument executed by the parties
hereto.

10.13 Further Acts. If, at any time after the Closing Date, any 
further action by the Seller is necessary or appropriate to more effectively 
convey, transfer and assign to Buyer the Shares or for aiding and assisting and
collecting and reducing to possession and exercising rights with respect
thereto, Seller shall promptly and at its own expense cause such action to be
taken.
