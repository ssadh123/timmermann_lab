ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On September 29, 1994, Conseco Capital Partners II, L.P. ("CCP
II"), a Delaware limited partnership, completed the acquisition (the
"Acquisition") of The Statesman Group, Inc. ("Statesman"). After the
Acquisition and related financing transactions, CCP II owns approximately 80
percent of the outstanding shares of Statesman's common stock. Conseco, Inc. 
("Conseco") formed CCP II in February 1994 with several other investors for the
purpose of investing in acquisitions of annuity, life and accident and health
insurance companies and related businesses. Conseco Partnership Management,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Conseco, is the sole general partner of CCP
II. Because a subsidiary of Conseco is the sole general partner of CCP II,
Conseco controls CCP II and Statesman. Accordingly, Conseco's consolidated
financial statements will include the accounts of CCP II and Statesman. 
Conseco, through its direct investment and through its equity interest in the
investments made by Bankers Life Holding Corporation ("BLH"), CCP Insurance,
Inc. ("CCP Insurance") and Western National Corporation ("WNC"), has
approximately a 27 percent ownership interest in Statesman. The remaining 73
percent ownership interest in Statesman is described as the "Statesman Minority
Interest".

The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to an Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated May 1, 1994, providing for the merger of Statesman with a
subsidiary of CCP II. Statesman's former stockholders received $15.25 in cash
per common equivalent share plus a contingent payment right to receive up to
another $2.00 in cash per common equivalent share ("the Contingent
Consideration") based on the outcome of Statesman's pending litigation against
the U.S. Government concerning Statesman's former savings bank subsidiary (the
"Government Litigation"). 

The Acquisition and related transactions were funded with: (i)
$45.0 million of cash contributions made to CCP II by its partners (including
$7.2 million provided by wholly owned subsidiaries of Conseco, $1.8 million by
BLH, $1.8 million by CCP Insurance, and $3.6 million by WNC), (ii) $57.0
million in cash from the sale in a private placement of the payment-in-kind
preferred stock of Statesman (the "Statesman PIK Preferred Stock") (including
$25.9 million purchased by BLH and $24.0 million purchased by CCP Insurance)
(iii) $150.0 million in cash from the sale in a public offering by ALHC Merger
Corporation, a subsidiary of CCP II which was merged into American Life Holding
Company ("ALHC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Statesman, of its 11-1/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2004 (the "ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes") and (iv)
$200.0 million in cash from a senior secured loan (the "ALHC Senior Term
Loan") obtained by ALHC Merger Corporation (collectively referred to herein as
the "Statesman Financing"). The sources and uses of this financing are
summarized below (dollars in millions).

(i) In the event of an unfavorable determination of the Government
Litigation against the U.S. Government, $30.1 million would
be paid to the holders of Statesman's 1988 Series I and II
Preferred Stock $1 Par (the "Statesman 1988 Series Preferred
Stock"), which is currently held by the U.S. Government. In the
event of a favorable determination of this litigation, the same
amount, representing a portion of the Contingent Consideration, 
would be paid to the other former stockholders of Statesman.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4
CONSECO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(ii) This amount assumes conversion of all outstanding 6-1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2003 of Statesman (the 
"Convertible Debentures"), which were convertible into an
aggregate of 4,528,125 shares of Statesman common stock. To
the extent that any holders of the Convertible Debentures do not
convert such securities, the proceeds which would have been used
to pay such holders will be held in escrow until the Convertible
Debentures are converted by the holders thereof, are redeemed
by Statesman, or mature.

(iii) A subsidiary of Statesman was the borrower under a credit
facility with an outstanding balance including accrued interest
and fees of $55.5 million at the Acquisition date which was
repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the Statesman
Financing.

In accordance with the CCP II partnership agreement, Conseco received
fees for services provided of (i) $4.0 million related to the ALHC Senior Term
Loan and the ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes and (ii) $.9 million from the CCP
II Partners. 

The ALHC Senior Term Loan was provided by a syndicate of lenders with
Bank of America Illinois (formerly Continental Bank, N.A.) (the "Bank") as the
agent. The loan has two tranches. One tranche has an aggregate principal
amount of $160.0 million ("Tranche A") and the other tranche has an aggregate
principal amount of $40.0 million ("Tranche B"). On the Acquisition date,
$130.0 million and $40.0 million were borrowed under Tranche A and Tranche B,
respectively, with the remaining $30.0 million to be borrowed at a later date
when needed to redeem the Statesman 1988 Series Preferred Stock or pay the
Contingent Consideration, depending on the outcome of the Government
Litigation.

Tranche A and Tranche B bear interest at a rate of either the Banks's
Alternate Reference Rate plus an applicable margin payable monthly or the
Interbank Offered Rate ("IBOR") plus an applicable margin for periods of one,
two, three or six months as selected by ALHC from time to time (such rate
selected for the first three month period was 7.5 percent and 8.0 percent for
Tranche A and Tranche B, respectively.) The applicable margin for the rate
based on the Bank's Alternate Reference Rate will vary from .25 percent to 1.0
percent for Tranche A and from .75 percent to 1.5 percent for Tranche B
depending on the principal amount plus unused commitments. The applicable
margin for the rate based on IBOR will vary from 1.5 percent to 2.25 percent
for Tranche A and from 2.0 percent to 2.75 percent for Tranche B depending on
the principal amount plus unused commitments. 

The principal amounts of Tranche A and Tranche B are payable in annual
installments on April 1 of each year according to the following amortization
schedule (dollars in millions):

Mandatory prepayments will be required (i) from 50 percent of Excess
Cash Flow (as defined in the loan agreement), (ii) upon the sale or disposition
of any significant assets other than in the ordinary course of business and 
(iii) upon the sale or issuance of debt or equity securities of Statesman or
any of its subsidiaries. The ALHC Senior Term Loan is secured by, among other
things, pledges of the capital stock of ALHC's subsidiaries (American Life and
American Life and Casualty Marketing Division Co. ("AMCO") and the surplus
notes of American Life held by ALHC. The ALHC Senior Term Loan is
unconditionally guaranteed by Statesman and AMCO. Statesman has pledged the
common stock of ALHC as security for its guarantee. In addition, CCP II has
pledged to the lenders the Statesman common stock owned by CCP II.

CONSECO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at 11.25 percent,
payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15, and will mature on September
15, 2004. The ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes are redeemable at the option of
ALHC, in whole or in part, at any time on and after September 15, 1999,
initially at 105.625 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued interest,
declining to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued interest, on
and after September 15, 2001. 

Dividends on the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock accrue annually at 13
percent in additional shares of Statesman PIK Preferred Stock through 2005. 
Thereafter, dividends are payable quarterly at 15 percent per annum in cash. 
The Statesman PIK Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Statesman common stock
with respect to dividends, and upon liquidation, the Statesman PIK Preferred
Stock will carry a liquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share, plus
accrued unpaid dividends. The Statesman PIK Preferred Stock is redeemable at
the option of Statesman, in whole or from time to time in part. The optional
redemption price of the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock will be $1,000 per share,
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, and the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock
generally will not have any voting rights. As partial consideration for the
purchase of the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock, the purchasers received common
stock, representing 20 percent of the outstanding common stock of Statesman
immediately after the Acquisition.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE A--BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10
of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of
operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have
been included. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 1993.

On September 29, 1994, Conseco Capital Partners II, L.P. ("CCP
II"), a Delaware limited partnership, completed the acquisition (the
"Acquisition") of the Company (see Note E). The Acquisition will be accounted
for as a purchase business combination pursuant to which the reported values
of the acquired assets and liabilities of the Company are adjusted to their
estimated fair values at the Acquisition date. As such, future results of
operations and financial condition of the Company may vary significantly from
historical reported results of operations and financial condition. 

NOTE B--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

On January 13, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase by the Company of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common
stock in the open market at then-current market prices during calendar year
1994. Shares thus acquired will be used for general corporate purposes. 
Through June 30, 1994, the Company had acquired 47,312 shares at an aggregate
cost of $559,000 through the repurchase program. As a result of entering into
the merger agreement described in Note E, the Company is prohibited from
acquiring any shares of its capital stock while the merger is pending. 

The Board of Directors is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares
of Series Preferred Stock $1 Par from time to time in one or more series and
to fix the number of shares, designations, voting powers (if any), preferences
and rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of each series. 
Each series of Series Preferred Stock $1 Par shall be distinctly designated
and, except as otherwise stated, shall rank equally and be identical in all
respects. There were no changes in the number of shares of issued and
outstanding Series Preferred Stock $1 Par during the period ended June 30,
1994.

The Company's redeemable preferred stock consists of 100,000
shares of 1987 Series II Preferred Stock $1 Par, of which there were 77,130
shares outstanding at June 30, 1994 and December 31, 1993. The preferred
shares provide that the holder may require the Company to redeem the shares if
there is a change in control, as defined, of the Company. The outstanding
redeemable preferred shares are presented at their $100 per share liquidation
preference, less the outstanding ESOP loan guarantee balance of $4,000,000 and
$4,750,000 at June 30, 1994 and December 31, 1993, respectively.

At June 30, 1994 there were 9,183,724 shares of common stock
reserved for conversion of the Series Preferred Stock and 6 1/4% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures and for exercise of stock options (includes 1,058,335
shares reserved for conversion of 1987 Series II Preferred Stock $1 Par
reported as redeemable preferred stock). 

The Company declared a cash dividend on common stock of $.10 per
share in January 1994, which was paid in February 1994. All cumulative
dividends on the Company's Series Preferred Stock have been declared and paid
by the Company except that cumulative dividends aggregating $4,657,000 have
been declared on the 143,640 issued and outstanding shares of the Company's
1988 Series I and II Preferred Stock (the "1988 Series Preferred Stock") but
have not been paid and cumulative dividends on the 1988 Series Preferred Stock
aggregating $575,000 have not been declared. The Company has set off the
amount of the declared dividends on the 1988 Series Preferred Stock against
damages believed by the Company to be owing to it by the United States of

(see Note C). 

<PAGE> 11 THE STATESMAN GROUP, INC. and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE C--CONTINGENCIES

The Company's subsidiaries are involved in various pending or
threatened legal proceedings arising from the conduct of their businesses. 
These proceedings in some instances include claims for punitive damages and
similar types of relief in unspecified or substantial amounts, in addition to
amounts for alleged contractual liability or claims for equitable relief. In
management's opinion, after consultation with counsel and review of available 
facts, these proceedings will be ultimately resolved without materially
affecting the Company's financial condition.

The Company's insurance subsidiaries reinsure with other
reinsurers that portion of risks exceeding each company's retention limit. 
These reinsured risks are treated as though, to the extent of the reinsurance,
they are risks for which the subsidiaries are not liable. The Company remains
contingently liable in the event that the reinsuring companies do not meet
their obligations under these reinsurance contracts. 

Prior to 1984, a portion of the life insurance subsidiaries'
income was not subject to current income taxation, but was accumulated, for
income tax purposes, in "policyholders' surplus accounts." At December 31,
1993, the balances in the policyholders' surplus accounts aggregated
$12,672,000. These amounts are not taxable unless distributed to stockholders
or unless they exceed certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. 
Management does not intend to take actions nor does it expect any events to
occur that would cause income tax to be payable on these amounts; therefore,
deferred income taxes of $4,435,000 have not been provided on these amounts.

The Company has entered into employment continuation agreements
with certain executives of the Company and its subsidiaries that provide for
payments to these executives of amounts up to four times their annual
compensation if there is a change in control of the Company (as defined), and
a termination of their employment. The agreements do not constitute employment
contracts and only apply in circumstances following a change in control. The
maximum contingent liability at June 30, 1994 under these agreements is
$6,407,000. 

From time to time, mandatory assessments are levied on the
Company's insurance subsidiaries by life and health guaranty associations of
most states in which these subsidiaries are licensed to cover losses to
policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies. These
associations levy assessments (up to prescribed limits) on all member insurers
in a particular state in order to pay claims on the basis of the proportionate
share of premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which
the insolvent or rehabilitated insurer engaged. These assessments may be
deferred or forgiven in certain states if they would threaten an insurer's
financial strength and, in some states, these assessments can be partially
recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes. Prior to 1991, these
assessments were not material to the Company's financial statements. However,
during 1989 through 1992, the economy and other factors caused a number of
failures of several large life insurance companies which could result in
future assessments in material amounts. Assessments levied against the
Company's insurance subsidiaries and charged to expense for the six months
ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 and for the three months ended June 30, 1994 and
1993 were $934,000, $228,000, $614,000 and $65,000, respectively. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include provisions for all known
assessments that will be levied against the Company as indicated to date by the
various state guaranty associations. At the present time, the Company is not
able to reasonably estimate what amounts will ultimately be assessed to its
subsidiaries in the future for failures that have occurred to date and, as
such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any
provision for such potential assessments. 

In August 1990, the Company filed suit in the United States
Claims Court (the "Claims Court") against the United States of America. The
pending lawsuit concerns contractual agreements which were made by the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
former government regulatory agencies that were abolished by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, to induce the
Company to capitalize Statesman Bank for Savings, FSB (the "savings bank"),
formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the purpose of acquiring
four failed thrift institutions. In the lawsuit, the Company claims that the
defendant has breached its contractual agreements with respect to regulatory
capital. Accordingly, the pending lawsuit contends that this breach of
contract, which resulted in the disallowance of $21 million of capital which
the defendant promised would be perpetual for regulatory accounting purposes,
constitutes a taking of the Company's property without just compensation and
due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States
Constitution.

NOTE C--CONTINGENCIES--Continued

The pending lawsuit seeks rescission of the transaction between
the Company and the government agencies and recovery of the Company's
investment plus compensation for monies expended, costs incurred and the value
of benefits conferred on the defendant through the Company's purchase,
operation and management of the savings bank. Total restitution sought exceeds
$30 million. 
In July 1992, the Claims Court granted the Company's motion for
summary judgment as to the defendant's liability in the above-described
lawsuit. The Claims Court also consolidated this case with two others and
certified these cases for interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the "Court of Appeals"). Subsequently, the
Court of Appeals reversed the order of the Claims Court by a margin of two to
one and the Company filed a Petition for Rehearing with Suggestion for
Rehearing in Banc (the "Rehearing Petition") with the Court of Appeals. On
August 18, 1993, the Court of Appeals accepted the Rehearing Petition, vacated
its judgment entered on May 25, 1993 in favor of the defendant and withdrew its
opinion accompanying the judgment. The rehearing was held on February 10, 1994
and a decision is pending.

In 1985 the Company sold Statesman Insurance Company, a former
property-casualty insurance subsidiary. As part of this sale and as part of
a certain reinsurance agreement between Statesman Insurance Company and an
unconsolidated affiliated property-casualty insurance company, the Company
guaranteed and indemnified Statesman Insurance Company that it would suffer no
loss on the insurance liability reinsured by it in excess of the loss and loss 
adjustment expense reserves transferred to the affiliate pursuant to the terms
of the reinsurance agreement. The Company does not believe that the ultimate
settlement of the remaining outstanding claims covered by this guarantee will
materially exceed existing liabilities provided for such contingency.

NOTE D--ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," that became effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1993. The primary impact of Statement 115
is to require companies to classify their securities into categories based upon
the company's intent relative to the eventual disposition of the securities. 
Under the new rules, the Company's investments in debt securities (including
mortgage-backed securities) and equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values are to be classified in three categories and accounted
for as follows:

Held-to-Maturity Securities: Debt securities which the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity shall be reported
at amortized cost.

Trading Securities: Debt and marketable equity securities
purchased with the intent to sell in the near term shall be reported at fair
value and unrealized gains and losses shall be included in results of
operations.

Available-for-Sale Securities: Debt and marketable equity
securities not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading shall be
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as adjustments
to stockholders' equity.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 1992 and prior to the adoption
of this standard, the Company segregated its fixed maturity investments into
those that would be held until maturity and those that would be available for
sale. Available-for-sale fixed maturity investments were reported at the lower
of cost or estimated fair value, in the aggregate. At December 31, 1993 there
was no unrealized net loss on these investments.<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE D--ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD--Continued

As of January 1, 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement 115 for investments held as of or acquired after that date. In
accordance with Statement 115, prior-period financial statements have not been
restated to reflect the change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect
as of January 1, 1994 of adopting Statement 115 increased stockholders' equity
by $38,171,000 (net of adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs of
$41,831,000 and deferred income taxes of $20,554,000) to reflect the net
unrealized holding gains on securities previously carried at amortized cost;
there was no effect on net income as a result of the adoption of Statement 115. 
In the six-month period ended June 30, 1994, those net unrealized holding gains
decreased by $136,109,000 (net of adjustments to deferred policy acquisition
costs of $59,616,000 and deferred income taxes of $73,290,000). As of June 30,
1994, the Company's available-for-sale fixed maturity securities had net
unrealized losses of $97,938,000 (net of adjustments to deferred policy
acquisition costs of $17,785,000 and deferred income taxes of $52,736,000).

NOTE E--MERGER AGREEMENT

On September 29, 1994, CCP II completed the Acquisition of the
Company. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company's former
stockholders received $15.25 in cash per common equivalent share, plus the
right to receive up to another $2.00 in cash per common equivalent share based
on the outcome of the Company's pending litigation against the U. S. Government
concerning the Company's former savings bank subsidiary. CCP II is a Delaware
limited partnership which was formed by Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco") to invest in
acquisitions of annuity, life, and accident and health insurance companies and
related businesses. In connection with the Acquisition, the line of credit of
a subsidiary of the Company with a balance at the acquisition date of
approximately $54,800,000 was repaid. 

The Acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase business
combination pursuant to which the reported values of the acquired assets and
liabilities of the Company are adjusted to their estimated fair values at the
Acquisition date. The Company incurred indebtedness aggregating $350 million
to partially finance the Acquisition. As such, future results of operations
and the financial condition of the Company may vary significantly from
historical reported results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company and certain of the persons then serving on the Board
of Directors have been named in a purported class action suit commenced on May
3, 1994 relating to the Acquisition. The complainant seeks injunctive relief
and compensatory damages. The Company believes that such suit is without
merit and intends to contest it vigorously.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Stockholders
The Statesman Group, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of The Statesman Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' 
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of The Statesman Group, Inc. and subsidiaries at December
31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial
statements, during 1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for income
taxes.

NOTE A--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which, as
to the subsidiary insurance companies, differ in some respects from statutory
accounting practices followed in the preparation of financial statements
submitted to state insurance departments.

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of all
significant intercompany accounts and transactions.

Investments: Fixed maturity investments (bonds, notes and redeemable
preferred stocks) are reported at amortized cost less adjustments for other
than temporary declines in value and the allowance for credit losses unless
they have been identified for possible sale prior to maturity, in which case
they are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, in the aggregate
(see Note B for discussion of the impact of the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities," on January 1, 1994). The Company has the ability
and the intent to hold those fixed maturities reported as held for investment
until maturity. Actual principal prepayments and estimates of future principal
prepayments are used in the determination of amortized cost for certain
mortgage-backed securities. Factors used in determining estimates of future
prepayments include historical prepayment data and expected prepayment
performance under varying interest rate scenarios. 

Equity securities (common and non-redeemable preferred stocks) are carried
at current market value. Mortgage loans and policy loans are reported at
unpaid principal less allowance for loan losses. Short-term investments are
carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. 

Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on the
specific identification basis and are recognized in net income upon sale. 
Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and unrealized net losses on
fixed maturities available for sale net of applicable deferred income taxes,
are included directly in stockholders' equity and, accordingly, have no effect
on net income. 

Recognition of Revenues: Premiums for traditional life insurance products,
which include those products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits,
are recognized as revenues when due. Accident and health insurance premiums 
are earned pro rata over the periods to which the premiums relate.

Revenues for investment contracts (principally deferred annuities) and
universal life and single premium whole life insurance policies consist of
policy fund charges for cost of insurance, policy administration, and surrender
charges assessed against policyholder account balances and amortization of
policy initiation fees. Universal life insurance, single premium whole life
insurance and immediate annuity policies generate unearned policy fund charges
that represent fees assessed against policyholder fund balances in the policy
issue year. These unearned charges are included in other liabilities and are
amortized into income over the period benefitted using the same assumptions and
factors used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs: Commissions and other costs of issuing
and acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the
production of new and renewal business, to the extent recoverable, have been
deferred. 

Traditional life insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are being
amortized (with interest) over the expected premium-paying period of the
related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing
policy benefit reserves, including provisions for possible unfavorable
deviations.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 22

For deferred annuity contracts and universal life and single premium whole
life insurance policies, deferred policy acquisition costs are being amortized
generally in proportion to the present value (using the assumed crediting rate)
of expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality and
expense margins over the expected life of the policies, but not more than
fifteen years. This amortization is adjusted retrospectively when estimates
of current or future gross profits to be realized are revised. In 1993 and
1992, realized investment gains resulted in accelerated amortization expense
of $9,760,000 and $5,250,000, respectively. 

Policy Liabilities and Accruals -- Future Policy Benefits and Unearned
Premiums: Benefit reserves for deferred annuity contracts and universal life
and single premium whole life insurance policies are computed under a
retrospective deposit method and represent policyholder account balances before
applicable surrender charges. Policyholder account balances consist of
policyholder deposits accumulated at credited interest rates generally ranging
from 5.00% to 8.10% in 1993, 6.00% to 8.10% in 1992 and 7.00% to 8.95% in 1991,
less withdrawals and charges for mortality, administrative and policy
initiation expenses. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense
include benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policyholder
account balances. 
The liabilities for traditional life insurance policy benefits have been
determined using the net level reserve method
including assumptions as to investment yields, mortality, withdrawals and other
assumptions based on the life insurance
subsidiaries' prior experience modified as necessary to reflect anticipated
trends and to include provisions for possible
unfavorable deviations. Reserve interest assumptions generally range from
2.75% to 8.75%. Policy benefit claims are
charged to expense in the period that claims are incurred. Participating
business is immaterial and dividends related to such
business are included as part of the policy reserves.

Accident and health insurance reserves are comprised of unearned premium
reserves computed on the pro rata basis, and return of premium reserves and the
present value of amounts not yet due on long-term disability policies computed
on the same basis as life insurance.

Reinsurance: Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for
Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts." Under Statement
113, insurance liabilities are reported before the effects of reinsurance. 
Reinsurance receivables, including amounts related to insurance liabilities,
are reported as assets. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in
a manner consistent with the liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured
contracts. 

Prior to the adoption of Statement 113, insurance liabilities were reported
net of amounts ceded to and recoverable from reinsurers. As permitted by
Statement 113, the Company has elected not to reclassify prior year balance
sheet amounts to conform to the 1993 presentation and accordingly, policy
liabilities and accruals at December 31, 1992 were reduced by $6,089,000 for
estimated recoveries under reinsurance contracts. 

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities: Separate account assets and
liabilities represent funds held for the exclusive benefit of certain annuity
contract holders. Fees are received for administrative expenses and for
assuming certain mortality, investment and expense risks. Operations of the
separate account are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. 

Real Estate Acquired in Satisfaction of Debt: Real estate acquired in
satisfaction of debt is reported at the lower of the recorded investment in the
loan satisfied or estimated fair value of the assets received, adjusted for
estimated disposal costs. Specific write-downs for the estimated losses are
provided when the carrying value of real estate acquired exceeds the
estimated disposal value based on current appraisal.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 23

Property and Equipment: Property and equipment, which includes a building
and equipment recorded under a capitalized lease obligation, are reported at
cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Provisions for
depreciation and amortization are computed by straight-line and
declining-balance methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Excess of Cost Over Net Assets of Acquired Subsidiaries ("Goodwill"): 
Goodwill arising from acquisitions after 1970 is amortized over 40 years on a
straight-line basis, while amounts arising from acquisitions prior to 1971 are
not amortized because, in the opinion of management, there is a continuing
benefit.

Income Taxes: As discussed in Note C, effective January 1, 1993, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Under Statement 109, deferred income tax assets
or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial
statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax expenses or credits
are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period. 
Prior to the adoption of Statement 109, deferred income tax expenses or credits
were recorded to reflect the income tax consequences of timing differences
between the recording of income and expenses for financial reporting purposes
and for purposes of filing federal income tax returns at income tax rates in
effect when the difference arose.

Interest Rate Swaps and Collar: Net interest received or paid on interest
rate swap and collar contracts that qualify as hedges is recognized as an
interest adjustment as earned or incurred over the term of the contract. Gains
or losses on termination of such contracts are deferred and amortized as an
interest adjustment over the remaining original term of the contract. Interest
rate swaps that do not qualify as hedges are reported at the lower of cost
(accrued value of periodic net settlement amounts) or market, with changes in
the value of such swaps recognized in net investment income. 

Employee Benefits: Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." Statements 106 and 112 required companies to recognize expense
related to anticipated postretirement and postemployment benefits, other than
pensions, for current or former employees, their beneficiaries and covered
dependents and retirees. Adoption of these new statements did not have a
material impact on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993
and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting was not material. Prior
year financial statements were not restated to reflect adoption of these new
statements.

Earnings Per Share: Primary earnings per common share is based on the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding and
net income, after recognition of dividend requirements of the Series Preferred
Stock $1 Par and the tax benefits on the 1987 Series II Preferred Stock
dividends.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 24

Fully diluted earnings per common share assumes that the Series Preferred
Stock $1 Par and the 6 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures were converted
into common stock as of the date of issuance and that the related dividend and
interest requirements were eliminated. In addition, net income has been
reduced by the additional contribution to the employee stock ownership plan
("ESOP"), less applicable income tax benefits, that would be required to
service the ESOP debt, if the shares of 1987 Series II Preferred Stock were
converted into common stock. 

The number of shares and per share amounts reported for earnings per share
have been restated to give retroactive effect to the 5% stock dividend paid in
December 1993.

Cash Flow Information: For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash
flows, the Company considers all demand deposits and all interest-bearing
accounts not related to the investment function to be cash equivalents. 

Business Segments: The Company operates in the single business segment of
providing individual life insurance and annuity coverage within the United
States.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The following methods and assumptions
were used by the Company in determining estimated fair values of financial
instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments: The carrying amount
reported in the consolidated balance sheets for these instruments approximates
their estimated fair value.

Investment securities: Estimated fair values for fixed maturity securities
and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. For
investment securities not actively traded, estimated fair values are determined
using values obtained from independent pricing services or, in the case of
private placements, are determined by discounting expected future cash flows
using current market interest rates applicable to the yield, credit quality,
and for fixed maturity securities, maturity of the investments. The estimated
fair values for equity securities are recognized in the consolidated balance
sheets.

Mortgage loans and policy loans: The estimated fair values of mortgage
loans and policy loans are determined by discounting future expected cash flow,
using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers
with similar credit ratings. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated
for purposes of the calculations. 

Off-balance sheet financial instruments: Estimated fair values of interest
rate swaps and the collar are based on bids from swap dealers which represent
the net value or cost of terminating the contracts at the balance sheet date. 
Estimated fair values for the Company's lending commitments are based on fees
currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing.

Investment contracts: Estimated fair values of the Company's annuity
contracts are equal to the cash surrender value available to the policyholder
on the balance sheet date. Estimated fair values for the Company's liabilities
under other investment-type insurance contracts, such as supplementary
contracts without life contingencies, are determined by discounting expected
future cash flows using interest rates currently being offered for similar
contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts
being valued.

The following table presents the reported value and estimated fair value of
deferred and immediate annuities and supplementary contracts without life
contingencies at December 31, 1993 and 1992:

</TABLE>

Estimated fair values of the Company's insurance contracts other than
investment contracts are not required to be disclosed. However, the estimated
fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into
consideration in the Company's overall management of interest rate risk.

Long-term debt: The estimated fair value of the Company's
publicly-traded convertible subordinated debentures is based on quoted market
prices. The estimated fair value of other fixed rate long-term debt is
determined by discounting expected future cash flows using assumed incremental
borrowing rates for similar duration borrowing arrangements. The estimated
fair value of variable rate long-term debt approximates its reported value. 

Redeemable preferred stock: The estimated fair value of the
publicly-traded redeemable preferred stock issued by the Company's wholly-owned
subsidiary is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of the
privately placed redeemable preferred stock issued by the Company's
wholly-owned subsidiary is determined by discounting expected future cash flows
using assumed incremental dividend rates for similar duration securities. The
estimated fair value of the parent company's redeemable preferred stock (1987
Series II) is determined using pricing models for convertible equity
securities.

Pending Accounting Standards: In May 1993, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan." 
Statement 114 applies to all loans except large groups of smaller-balance
homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment, loans
measured at fair value or at lower of cost or fair value, leases and debt
securities as defined in Statement 115. Statement 114 requires that impaired
loans be valued at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate or at the loan's observable market price
or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. 
Statement 114 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994,
with earlier adoption encouraged.

Statement 114 applies primarily to the Company's mortgage loan
portfolio. The Company actively monitors this portfolio and evaluates the net
realizable value of any loan which is deemed to be impaired. Net realizable
value is generally assessed based upon current appraisal value of the
underlying collateral. If carrying value exceeds this estimated realizable
value, carrying value is reduced to the estimated realizable value by a charge
to earnings (realized loss on investments). As such, this statement does not
represent a material change from the Company's current accounting practices and
the Company does not expect adoption of this Statement to have any material
effect on its reported financial results.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 26

In June 1993, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft entitled "Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation." If adopted as a SFAS in its present form, this
exposure draft would require that compensation expense be recognized for all
stock options in an amount equal to "fair value" on the date of grant. Fair
value is to be calculated using an option pricing model or similar valuation
technique. Recognition of compensation expense using this methodology is
expected to be required for options granted after December 31, 1996 with
pro-forma disclosure for the options granted after December 31, 1993. The
terms of the stock options granted by the Company in recent years have always
been fixed with option prices equal to market value on the date of grant. As
a result, the Company does not currently recognize compensation expense on
these options. The final form of the proposed SFAS has not been issued and,
accordingly, the effect of implementation of the proposed SFAS on the Company
has not been determined.

Reclassification: Certain items in the 1992 and 1991 consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the
presentations made in the 1993 consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE B--INVESTMENTS

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities," that becomes effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993. The primary impact of Statement 115 is to
require companies to classify their securities into categories based upon the
company's intent relative to the eventual disposition of the securities. Under
the new rules, the Company's investments in debt securities (including
mortgage-backed securities) and equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values are to be classified in three categories and accounted
for as follows:

Held-to-Maturity Securities: Debt securities which the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold until maturity shall be reported at
amortized cost. 

Trading Securities: Debt and marketable equity securities purchased
with the intent to sell in the near term shall be reported at fair value and
unrealized gains and losses shall be included in results of operations.

Available-for-Sale: Debt and marketable equity securities not
classified as either held-to-maturity or trading shall be reported at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses reported as adjustments to stockholders'
equity.

During the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company segregated its fixed
maturity investments into those that would be held until maturity and those
that would be available for sale. Available for sale fixed maturity
investments are presently reported at the lower of cost or estimated fair
value, in the aggregate. Unrealized net losses on these investments were $0
at December 31, 1993 and 1992. Statement 115 precludes sales of securities
classified as held-to-maturity as well as transfers of such securities to one
of the other two classifications except in very limited circumstances. As a
result, a greater portion of the Company's fixed maturity investments are
classified as available for sale at December 31, 1993 than at December 31,
1992.

The adoption of Statement 115 will expose the Company's stockholders'
equity to greater volatility due to changes in market interest rates and the
attendant changes in the reported value of securities classified as
available-for-sale. The Company presently does not anticipate entering into
certain portfolio management practices, such as hedging transactions, to
minimize this volatility; however, the Company will continue to study this
matter. The Company intends to adopt Statement 115 on January 1, 1994. Upon
adoption, there may be some changes in the classifications of securities from
those reported herein but such changes are not expected to be significant.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 27

Upon adoption of Statement 115 on January 1, 1994, stockholders' equity
will increase by the amount of net unrealized gain on securities designated as
available-for-sale ($85,278,000 at December 31, 1993) less adjustments for (a)
additional amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs that would
have been reported if such gains were realized estimated at 40% - 50% of the
net unrealized gain and (b) applicable federal income taxes of 35% of the
difference between the net unrealized gain and the deferred policy acquisition
cost adjustment. The net increase in stockholders' equity attributable to the
adoption of Statement 115 is estimated to be $30,000,000 - $35,000,000.

was $53,424,000 and $51,606,000, respectively.

The Company manages its investments to limit credit risk by diversifying
its portfolio among various security types and industry sectors. At December
31, 1993, the Company's unrated or below investment grade corporate fixed
maturities amounted to 1% of the Company's fixed maturity investments and less
than 1% of total investments and total assets. 

Investments in mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 1993
principally consisted of collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") and
comprised 59% of the Company's fixed maturity investments at that date. 
Included in such investments were $1.5 billion of CMOs and mortgage-backed
pass-through securities issued by non-government agencies (39% of total fixed
maturity investments). The Company's holdings primarily consist of senior
securities in the CMO structures which are collateralized by first mortgage
liens on single family and multifamily residences. Approximately 53% of such
investments are secured by properties located in California with no other state
representing more than 7%. All of these securities are rated investment grade
with more than 85% of such securities rated AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation, or the comparable equivalent rating by another independent
nationally recognized rating agency. 

Investments, all of which are fixed maturities, in any entity in excess
of ten percent of stockholders' equity at December 31, 1993, other than
investments in affiliates and investments issued or guaranteed by the United
States Government or a United States Government agency, are as follows. 
Mortgage-backed securities issued by non-government entities are aggregated by
the issuing entity with the number of individual securities identified
parenthetically following the issuer's name. The creditworthiness of these
securities is based solely on the underlying segregated pools of mortgage loan
collateral and related credit enhancements rather than the general
creditworthiness of the issuing entity.

NOTE C--INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting
for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (see Note A). The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of
January 1, 1993 and the effect of the change on federal income tax expense for
the year ended December 31, 1993 was not material. Under Statement 109, the
Company no longer reports the tax benefits from operating and capital loss
carryforwards as extraordinary credits. As permitted by Statement 109, the
Company has elected not to restate prior years' financial statements.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 32

Under Statement 109, deferred income taxes reflect the net income tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. Income tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 1993 and
January 1, 1993 are as follows:

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return including all
eligible subsidiaries. At December 31, 1993, the Company has net operating
loss carry-forwards of $26,123,000 which expire in 1999 through 2008. These
loss carryforwards relate to the operations of the non-life consolidated group. 
Utilization of these loss carryforwards to offset taxable income of the life
insurance subsidiaries is limited under existing federal income tax rules and
regulations. Valuation allowances of $2,688,000 and $4,069,000 have been
established at December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1993, respectively, to offset
the related deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing the
benefit of the loss carryforwards.

The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 changed the Company's prevailing
federal income tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1, 1993. The
Company's additional federal income tax expense for 1993 due to the increase
in the tax rate was $685,000. The application of the 35% tax rate to the
December 31, 1992 deferred income tax liability balance did not have a material
effect on the Company's 1993 provision for federal income taxes.

Prior to 1984, a portion of the life insurance subsidiaries' income was
not subject to current income taxation, but was accumulated, for income tax
purposes, in "policyholders' surplus accounts." At December 31, 1993, the
balances in the policyholder surplus accounts aggregated $12,672,000. These
amounts are not taxable unless distributed to stockholders or unless they
exceed certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. Management does
not intend to take actions nor does it expect any events to occur that would
cause income tax to be payable on these amounts; therefore, deferred income
taxes of $4,435,000 have not been provided on these amounts.

</TABLE>

6 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003: On April 28, 1993,
the Company issued $69 million face amount of 6 1/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2003. Net proceeds from the public offering of $66,161,000 were
used to retire all outstanding senior bank debt, to repurchase 516,600 shares
of the Company's common stock through open market purchases, to fund a $35
million capital contribution to the Company's primary life insurance subsidiary
and for general corporate purposes.

The debentures are presented at their face amount less unamortized
issuance costs, pay interest semi-annually and are subordinated in right of
payment to all senior indebtedness as defined in the indenture governing the
debentures. The indenture does not restrict the Company or any subsidiary from
incurring additional senior indebtedness or other obligations.

The debentures are convertible at any time prior to maturity, unless
previously redeemed, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion
ratio of 65.625 shares of common stock for each 1,000 principal amount of
debentures ($15.24 per share of common stock). The debentures are redeemable,
in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time on or after May
1, 1996 initially at 106% of the principal amount and declining to 100% of the
principal amount on or after May 1, 1999. In the event of a change in control
as defined in the indenture, debenture holders have the right to require the
Company to purchase all or any part of such holder's debentures at 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest. At the option of the Company, such
purchase may be made for cash or shares of the Company's common stock.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 36

Senior Bank Debt and ESOP Notes: In January 1993, the Company entered
into a new senior credit facility with a commercial bank. Under the new
facility, the final maturity of the Company's then outstanding term loan was
extended until July 1997 and the Company borrowed an additional $10,000,000
under a new $10,000,000 revolving line of credit. Proceeds from the additional
borrowing were used to fund an escrow account established by the Company's
subsidiary in connection with the exchange of that subsidiary's 11 1/2%
subordinated debentures for redeemable preferred stock issued by the subsidiary
(see Note G). In April 1993, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds
from the sale of its 6 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures to retire all
of its outstanding senior bank debt and the revolving line of credit facility
was terminated.

The commercial bank referred to above also holds the outstanding notes
issued by the Company's employee stock ownership plan (the "ESOP"). The
$4,750,000 outstanding principal balance on these notes at December 31, 1993
is repayable as follows: $750,000 in 1994, annual installments of $1,000,000
each in 1995 and 1996 and two $1,000,000 installments in 1997. Interest
charges on the ESOP notes are payable quarterly at 97% of the prime rate of the
commercial bank. The annual rate of interest is subject to adjustment in the
event that certain changes in federal income tax laws or rates occur. In
addition, the Company has agreed to pay the commercial bank a quarterly fee so
that, after giving effect to such fee and the interest paid by the ESOP, the
commercial bank would receive an aggregate payment equal to the greater of the
prime rate of the commercial bank plus .5% or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1%.

The obligations to the commercial bank for the ESOP notes are secured
by a pledge of, and a security interest in, 37,396 shares of the Company's 1987
Series II Preferred Stock $1 Par owned by the ESOP. The ESOP loan is further
secured by the Company's guaranty and the Company's agreement to make
contributions to the ESOP from time to time in such amounts as may be necessary
to enable the ESOP to make all payments of principal and interest on the ESOP
notes when due.

The ESOP credit agreement contains restrictions and covenants which,
among other things, limit the amount of future indebtedness, limit the amounts
and types of investments including investments in below investment grade bonds,
equity securities and real property, require the maintenance of specified
amounts of consolidated tangible net worth, statutory capital and surplus and
fixed charge coverage and limit the payment of cash dividends. Under the most
restrictive of these covenants, $17,042,000 of consolidated retained earnings
at December 31, 1993 is not restricted as to the declaration or payment of cash 
dividends. The credit agreement also contains a change of control covenant
that may result in the acceleration of the payment of all amounts due under the
ESOP notes in the event of a change in control as defined in the agreement.

11 1/2% Subordinated Debentures: In 1991 and 1990, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company issued $30,000,000 of 11 1/2% subordinated
debentures. Proceeds from the debenture issues were invested in preferred
stock and surplus notes issued by the Company's primary life insurance
subsidiary. On February 2, 1993, the Company's subsidiary redeemed the
debentures at par by exchanging $30,000,000 of a new series of its redeemable
preferred stock for all of the outstanding debentures (see Note G).
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 37

Subsidiary's Bank Line of Credit: On September 30, 1993, a
non-insurance subsidiary of the Company entered into an amended and restated
credit agreement with several commercial banks pursuant to which the banks
agreed to provide this subsidiary with a $125,000,000 line of credit. The new
agreement amended and restated an existing agreement previously entered into
in May 1990, as subsequently amended, between the Company's noninsurance
subsidiary and the commercial bank referred to above to provide for, among
other things, an increase in the amount of the credit facility and for
additional lenders to become parties thereto. At December 31, 1993,
$79,798,000 remains available through June 1995 under this line of credit. The
actual amount funded will be determined based on the amount of new annuity
business written by the Company's primary life insurance subsidiary during the
funding period. 

Principal and interest on the funds drawn under this line of credit are
payable in sixteen quarterly installments beginning on the eighth calendar day
following the end of each calendar year quarter in which the funds are drawn. 
The credit agreement requires the Company's subsidiary to make loan prepayments
with any excess funds not otherwise used to fund commission payments to agents
or to make scheduled principal and interest payments. Interest charges are,
at the Company's option, LIBOR plus 1.25% or the greater of the agent bank's
prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus .5%, and a quarterly commitment fee
is charged equal to .375% per annum of the average daily unused amount of the
line of credit. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding loan
balance at December 31, 1993 was 4.74%. 

Borrowings under the line of credit are principally secured by a pledge
of certain contract rights between the Company's primary life insurance
subsidiary and the Company's non-insurance subsidiary. The credit agreement
imposes various restrictions on the Company's non-insurance subsidiary and
requires it to hedge at least $25,000,000 of borrowings through July 1996 to
protect itself against three-month LIBOR exceeding 4.74% per annum. Pursuant
to that requirement, this subsidiary is the fixed rate payor under an interest
rate swap contract having a notional amount of $25,000,000 and a term of three
years ending July 1996 (see Note I). 

In addition to customary events of default, the credit agreement
specifies certain events of default with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries, including its primary life insurance subsidiary, which include,
among other things, the occurrence of a change in control, as defined in the
credit agreement, of the Company, its non-insurance subsidiary, its primary
life insurance subsidiary and another non-insurance subsidiary, payment
defaults by the Company or its primary life insurance subsidiary on certain
obligations to the non-insurance subsidiary, and failure by the primary life
insurance subsidiary to maintain specified amounts of statutory capital and
surplus and to limit the amount of future indebtedness and the amount of its
investments in below investment grade bonds, equity securities and real
property. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the
commercial banks terminating their commitments under the credit agreement
and/or accelerating the payment of amounts due thereunder. The credit
agreement is an "evergreen" agreement renewable for additional eighteen month
periods by mutual consent of the Company, its subsidiaries and the commercial
banks. The line of credit is not guaranteed by the Company, its primary life
insurance subsidiary or any of its other subsidiaries. 

Real Estate Mortgage: The 10% real estate mortgage is payable in
monthly installments of $28,000 including interest, through 1994 with a balloon
payment of $2,185,000 due in December 1994. The net book value at December 31,
1993 of the Company's home office building pledged as collateral for the loan
is $4,067,000. <PAGE>
<PAGE> 38

Capitalized Lease Obligation: The 10% capitalized lease obligation
requires monthly payments of $17,000, including interest, through 2009. The
lease relates to a subsidiary's former home office building financed through
the issuance of a municipality's industrial development revenue bonds. The
subsidiary's former home office building, land and equipment, having a cost of
$3,101,000 and accumulated amortization of $1,050,000 at December 31, 1993, are
pledged as collateral for the lease obligation. Approximately 90% of this
building is subleased to unrelated parties under sublease agreements expiring
in 1995 and 1998 with aggregate annual sublease payments of $475,000. 

Aggregate Maturities of Long-term Debt: Aggregate maturities of
long-term debt, including the present value of the 10% capitalized lease
obligation, during each of the five years subsequent to 1993 are as follows:
1994--$19,909,000; 1995--$15,120,000; 1996--$11,771,000; 1997--$5,813,000 and
1998--$66,000.

NOTE E--SERIES PREFERRED STOCK

The Board of Directors is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of Series
Preferred Stock $1 Par from time to time in one or more series and to fix the
number of shares, designations, voting powers (if any), preferences and rights,
and qualifications, limitations or restrictions of each series. Each series
of Series Preferred Stock $1 Par shall be distinctly designated and, except as
otherwise stated, shall rank equally and be identical in all respects.

Redeemable Preferred Stock: There were 77,130 shares and 81,901 shares
of 1987 Series II Preferred Stock $1 Par outstanding at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively. All of the 1987 Series II shares are owned by the
Company's employee stock ownership plan (the "ESOP") (see Note H) and the
shares are presented at their $100 per share liquidation preference less the
outstanding ESOP loan guarantee balance (see Note D). The estimated fair value
of the 1987 Series II shares at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $14,848,000 and
$14,496,000, respectively. 

The 1987 Series II shares are entitled to annual cumulative cash
dividends equal to the issue price multiplied by the prime rate of a specified
commercial bank plus 3/4 of 1% (6.75% at December 31, 1993), payable quarterly. 
Cash dividends paid in 1993, 1992 and 1991 were equivalent to $6.75 per share,
$7.37 per share and $9.87 per share, respectively. 

The Company may, at its option, redeem the 1987 Series II shares, in
whole or in part, at any time after ten years from date of issue at a price of
$100 per share plus cumulative unpaid dividends. In the event of a change in
control of the Company, as specified in the resolution creating the series,
each 1987 Series II share shall be redeemed at a price equal to the greater of
$100 per share, plus cumulative unpaid dividends or the fair market value
thereof. In liquidation, 1987 Series II stockholders are entitled to $100 per
share (aggregate $7,713,000) plus cumulative unpaid dividends before any
distribution shall be made to common stockholders. The 1987 Series II shares
rank on parity with the other Series Preferred Stock shares with respect to
dividends and distributions.

During 1993, 1992, and 1991, the Company exchanged 70,510 shares, 32,403
shares and 126,166 shares, respectively, of its common stock with the ESOP for
4,771 shares, 2,312 shares and 7,334 shares, respectively, of its 1987 Series
II Preferred Stock for the purpose of making distributions of the 1987 Series
II shares to terminated ESOP plan
participants.

Each 1987 Series II share is entitled to eleven votes on each matter
submitted to a vote at any meeting of the Company's stockholders. In addition,
with respect to the approval of certain business combinations, the 1987 Series
II shares are entitled to vote separately as a class, and the affirmative vote
of at least 75% of the outstanding 1987 Series II shares is required for such
approval. 

Each 1987 Series II share is convertible at any time into 13.7214 shares
of common stock. Antidilution rights of the owners of 1987 Series II shares
are specified in the resolutions creating the series. At December 31, 1993,
1,058,335 shares of common stock are reserved for conversion of the 1987 Series
II shares.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 39

1976 Series Preferred Stock: The Company has issued 200,000 shares of
1976 Series Preferred Stock $1 Par, of which there were 195,000 shares and
200,000 shares outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. During
1993, 5,000 1976 Series shares were converted into 15,281 shares of common
stock.

The 1976 Series shares are entitled to annual cumulative cash dividends
of $.425 per share, payable semi-annually. All of the 1976 Series shares are
owned by the ESOP (see Note H). The Company may, at its option, redeem the
1976 Series shares, in whole or in part, at any time at a price of $5 per share
plus cumulative unpaid dividends. In liquidation, 1976 Series stockholders are
entitled to receive $5 per share (aggregate $975,000) plus cumulative unpaid
dividends before any distribution shall be made to common stockholders. The
1976 Series shares rank on parity with the other Series Preferred Stock shares
with respect to dividends and distributions. 

Each 1976 Series share is entitled to one vote and is convertible at any
time into 3.21 shares of common stock. Antidilution rights of the owners of
1976 Series shares are specified in the resolutions creating the series. At
December 31, 1993, 625,769 shares of common stock are reserved for conversion
of the 1976 Series shares. 

1988 Series I and Series II Preferred Stock: In 1988 and 1989, the
Company issued a total of 143,640 shares of 1988 Series I and Series II
Preferred Stock (the "1988 Series shares") to its former savings bank
subsidiary which was taken over by government regulators in 1990 (see Note K). 
The Company has a lawsuit pending against the United States government which
litigation seeks, among other things, recovery of the Company's investment in
its former savings bank subsidiary, including the 1988 Series shares. Because
there is no assurance beyond a reasonable doubt that the Company will prevail
in its lawsuit, the 1988 Series shares are presented as issued and outstanding
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 1993
and 1992 and were given full recognition in the computations of primary and
fully diluted earnings per share for all periods presented.

Beginning in 1990, the 1988 Series shares are entitled to annual
cumulative cash dividends of $8 per share, payable quarterly. The Company has
declared but not paid cumulative dividends on the 1988 Series shares
aggregating $4,657,000 ($40 per share on 7,560 shares of 1988 Series II
Preferred Stock and $32 per share on the balance of the 1988 Series shares),
including $862,000 ($6 per share) declared in January 1994. As discussed
above, the 1988 Series shares are involved in the pending litigation related
to the takeover of the Company's former savings bank subsidiary (see Note K)
and the Company has set off the amount of the declared dividends against
damages believed by the Company to be owing to the Company by the United States
of America.

The Company may, at its option, redeem the 1988 Series shares, in whole
or in part, at any time after ten years (five years for the 1988 Series II
shares) from the date of issue at a price of $100 per share plus cumulative
unpaid dividends. In liquidation, 1988 Series stockholders are entitled to
$100 per share (aggregate $14,364,000) plus cumulative unpaid dividends before
any distribution shall be made to common stockholders. The 1988 Series shares
rank on parity with the other Series Preferred Stock shares with respect to
dividends and distributions.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 40

The 1988 Series shares are non-voting except as required by the Delaware
General Corporation Law and except if the Company fails to pay dividends on
such shares for six consecutive quarters, in which case holders of the 1988
Series shares are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to
a vote at any meeting of the Company's stockholders. Each 1988 Series share
is convertible at any time into 13.7214 shares of common stock. Antidilution
rights of the owners of 1988 Series shares are specified in the resolutions
creating the series. At December 31, 1993, 1,970,942 shares of common stock
are reserved for conversion of the 1988 Series shares. 

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights: In April 1991, the Company redeemed
all of its outstanding preferred stock purchase rights that had been issued
pursuant to a Rights Agreement adopted in 1987. Each share of the Company's
common stock had one preferred stock purchase right attached and received the
redemption price of $.01 per right. Subsequent to the rights redemption, the
Board of Directors eliminated the series of 250,000 shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, which had been designated and reserved for
issuance upon exercise of the now redeemed rights, from the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation.

On May 5, 1993, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of authorized
shares of common stock from 25,000,000 to 35,000,000 shares. On May 19, 1993,
the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by the Company of
up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. This authorization
expired on December 31, 1993 and 516,600 shares were acquired for treasury
through the repurchase program. Authorization for the Company to repurchase
up to 1,000,000 additional shares of its common stock during calendar year 1994
was approved by its Board of Directors on January 13, 1994.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 41
At December 31, 1993, there were 9,224,270 shares of common stock
reserved for conversion of the Series Preferred Stock and 6 1/4% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures and for exercise of stock options. Treasury stock at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 included 927,299 shares and 1,016,476 shares,
respectively, of common stock owned by a subsidiary of the Company. Treasury
shares held by subsidiaries are entitled to dividends but do not have voting
rights. 

The net assets of the insurance subsidiaries available for transfer to
the Company are limited to the amounts by which the insurance subsidiaries' net
assets, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by state regulatory authorities, exceed minimum
regulatory statutory capital and surplus requirements; however, payment of
dividends or other distributions to stockholders may also be subject to prior
approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, the ability of the insurance
subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company is limited by certain provisions
in the Company's loan agreements relating to the maintenance of specified
minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus (see Note D). At December 31,
1993, $43,856,000 of consolidated stockholders' equity (based on amounts
reported in accordance with statutory accounting practices) represents net
assets of the insurance subsidiaries that cannot be transferred to the Company
in the form of dividends, surplus note payments, loans or advances.

Combined capital and surplus of the insurance subsidiaries, as reported
in accordance with statutory accounting practices of their respective states
of domicile, was $214,317,000 and $178,842,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Combined statutory net income for 1993, 1992 and 1991 was
$32,019,000, $16,538,000 and $32,566,000, respectively.

NOTE G--PREFERRED STOCK OF WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY

On August 25, 1992, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company issued 
2,760,000 shares of non-convertible redeemable preferred stock at a public
offering price of $25 per share. $42,500,000 of the net proceeds from the
offering were contributed to the capital of the Company's primary life
insurance subsidiary. Remaining net proceeds of approximately $22,600,000 were
used to purchase $69,000,000 face amount of zero coupon U.S. Treasury
securities maturing in August 2007. These securities have been placed in an
escrow account to be used for the future redemption of the redeemable preferred
stock on or before its mandatory redemption date in 2007.

The subsidiary's redeemable preferred stock is entitled to annual
cumulative cash dividends of $2.16 per share, payable quarterly. The
redeemable preferred stock is mandatorily redeemable in September 2007 at a
redemption price of $25 per share, plus cumulative unpaid dividends. In
liquidation, holders of the subsidiary's redeemable preferred stock are
entitled to $25 per share (aggregate $69,000,000) plus cumulative unpaid
dividends. 

On February 2, 1993, the subsidiary referred to above issued 1,200,000
shares of a non-convertible redeemable preferred stock at an issue price of $25
per share (aggregate $30,000,000) in exchange for all of the subsidiary's
outstanding 11 1/2% subordinated debentures which were retired (see Note D). 
In connection therewith, the subsidiary purchased $30,000,000 face amount of
zero coupon U.S. Treasury securities maturing in February 2008 with the
proceeds of a $10,000,000 borrowing under the Company's revolving line of
credit (see Note D). These securities have been placed in an escrow account
to be used for the future redemption of the second series of redeemable
preferred stock on or before its mandatory redemption date in 2008.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 42

The second series of the subsidiary's redeemable preferred stock is
entitled to annual cumulative cash dividends of $2.32 per share, payable
quarterly. This series of redeemable preferred stock is mandatorily redeemable
in February 2008 at a redemption price of $25 per share, plus cumulative unpaid
dividends. In liquidation, holders of this series of the subsidiary's
redeemable preferred stock are entitled to $25 per share (aggregate
$30,000,000) plus cumulative unpaid dividends.

The subsidiary's redeemable preferred stock is presented at its fair
value on the date of issue ($69,000,000 and $30,000,000, respectively) less
unamortized issue costs. The excess of the mandatory redemption value over the
reported value is being accreted by periodic charges to income from continuing
operations over the life of the issue. The aggregate fair value of the
subsidiary's redeemable preferred stock was $109,276,000 and $65,895,000, at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

NOTE H--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company and its subsidiaries participate in a qualified trusteed
plan, The Statesman Group, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust
("Plan"), which provides for a uniform noncontributory retirement program
covering all eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Contributions to the Plan are equal to 10% of eligible compensation of all
participants plus such additional amounts (2.9%, 3.1% and 1.8% for 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively) as may be determined annually by the Board of
Directors. In addition, the Company has agreed that it will make contributions
to the Plan from time to time in such amounts as may be necessary to enable the
Plan to make all payments of principal and interest on the Plan's bank loan
when due (see Note D). Total plan expense for 1993, 1992 and 1991 amounted to
$900,000, $900,000 and $815,000, respectively. 

In 1987, the Plan purchased 100,000 shares of the Company's 1987 Series
II Preferred Stock $1 Par for $10,000,000 financed by a ten-year bank loan
guaranteed by the Company (see Note D). For the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991, interest expense of $293,000, $367,000 and $577,000,
respectively, on the ESOP loan was funded by the dividends received on the 1987
Series II Preferred Stock. The remaining ESOP loan guarantee balance of
$4,750,000 at December 31, 1993, which is included in long-term debt and
deducted from redeemable preferred stock in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, will be further reduced in future years as the Plan's debt is
reduced and shares are allocated to Plan participants. At December 31, 1993,
the Plan owned 44,757 shares of the Company's common stock, 195,000 shares of
the Company's 1976 Series Preferred Stock $1 Par and 77,130 shares of the
Company's 1987 Series II Preferred Stock $1 Par.

The Company and its subsidiaries participate in the Statesman Savings
Plan 401(k) (the "401(k) plan"), a qualified salary deferral retirement plan
covering all eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Employees
may contribute a portion of their annual salary, subject to limitation, to the
401(k) plan. The Company and its subsidiaries contribute an additional amount,
subject to limitation but not to exceed 2% of eligible compensation, based on
the voluntary contributions of the employees. The 401(k) plan provides that
all employer matching contributions will be invested in shares of Company
stock. At December 31, 1993, the 401(k) plan held 55,900 shares of the
Company's common stock. Plan contributions charged to expense for 1993, 1992
and 1991 were $90,000, $85,000 and $76,000, respectively. <PAGE>
<PAGE> 43

NOTE I--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation: The Company's subsidiaries are involved in various pending
or threatened legal proceedings arising from the conduct of their businesses. 
These proceedings in some instances include claims for punitive damages and
similar types of relief in unspecified or substantial amounts, in addition to
amounts for alleged contractual liability or claims for equitable relief. In
management's opinion, after consultation with counsel and review of available
facts, these proceedings will ultimately be resolved without materially
affecting the Company's financial condition.

Reinsurance: In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to
limit its exposure to loss on any single insured and to recover a portion of
benefits paid by ceding reinsurance to other insurance enterprises or
reinsurers. The Company's maximum retention limit on any one life is $100,000. 
Reinsurance assumed from other companies is not significant.

Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations
to its policyholders. The Company remains contingently liable to its
policyholders for the portion reinsured to the extent that the reinsuring
companies do not meet their obligations assumed under the reinsurance
agreements. The aggregate receivable from reinsurers at December 31, 1993 was
$6,026,000, all of which was deemed collectible. Ceded reinsurance premiums
deducted from premiums and policy fund charges were $4,437,000, $4,389,000 and
$4,724,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Certain policy liabilities were reinsured under reinsurance transactions
which represented financing arrangements and, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, are not reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements except for the risk fees paid to reinsurers. 
These transactions were effectively terminated as of December 31, 1993. Net
statutory surplus provided by such treaties totaled $24.7 million at December
31, 1992. Risk fees paid to the reinsurers approximated 2.75% of the net
amount of surplus provided.

Employment Arrangements: The Company has entered into employment
continuation agreements with certain executives of the Company and its
subsidiaries that provide for payments to these executives of amounts up to
four times their annual compensation if there is a change in control of the
Company (as defined), and a termination of their employment. The agreements
do not constitute employment contracts and only apply in circumstances
following a change in control. The maximum contingent liability at December
31, 1993 under these agreements is $6,167,000.

Guaranty Fund Assessments: From time to time, mandatory assessments are
levied on the Company's insurance subsidiaries by life and health guaranty
associations of most states in which these subsidiaries are licensed to cover
losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies. 
These associations levy assessments (up to prescribed limits) on all member
insurers in a particular state in order to pay claims on the basis of the
proportionate share of premiums written by member insurers in the lines of
business in which the insolvent or rehabilitated insurer engaged. These
assessments may be deferred or forgiven in certain states if they would
threaten an insurer's financial strength and, in some states, these assessments
can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes. Prior
to 1991, these assessments were not material to the Company's financial
statements. However, the economy and other factors have recently caused a
number of failures of substantially larger companies which could result in
future assessments in material amounts. Assessments levied against the
Company's insurance subsidiaries and charged to expense in 1993, 1992 and 1991
were $2,623,000, $2,233,000, and $638,000, respectively. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include provisions for all known assessments
that will be levied against the Company's insurance subsidiaries by various
state guaranty associations. At the present time, the Company is not able to
reasonably estimate what amounts will ultimately be assessed to its
subsidiaries in the future for failures that have occurred to date and, as
such, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any
provision for such potential assessments.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 44

Interest Rate Swaps: The Company has entered into certain interest rate
swap and collar agreements to match the interest rate characteristics of
investments and related insurance liabilities for a portion of its single
premium deferred annuity liabilities. These agreements involve the exchange
of fixed and floating rate interest payments without an exchange of the
underlying notional principal amounts. The interest rate swap and collar
agreements effectively modify the interest rate characteristics of the single
premium deferred annuity liabilities which reprice annually at discretionary
rates determined by the Company to be less sensitive to changes in interest
rates. In addition, a non-insurance subsidiary of the Company has entered into
interest rate swap agreements to limit its exposure to increases in short-term
borrowing rates. 

Swap agreements subject the Company to the risk that the swap
counterparty will fail to perform. However, the potential credit loss is
limited to the periodic net settlement amounts due under the agreements and
nonperformance is not anticipated. In addition, with respect to those swap
contracts that do not qualify as hedges, the Company is subject to market risk
associated with changes in interest rates and declines in value of the
underlying financial instrument and with respect to the interest rate swaps
used to hedge floating rate bank debt, the Company has incurred higher interest
costs than if these agreements were not in place because short-term borrowing
rates have been lower than the applicable fixed rates indicated in the swap
agreements.

The notional amounts of interest rate swap and collar financial
instruments in effect at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are as follows:
<TABLE>

Received variable rates 250 
Used to hedge non-insurance subsidiary's floating 
rate bank debt 25 5 

</TABLE>

The interest rate collar and $250 million of interest rate swaps on
which the Company receives fixed rates expire in May 1996. The interest rate
collar is a combination of an interest rate cap and floor whereby the Company
is to receive payment if the six-month LIBOR exceeds 14% (the "cap") or is to
make payment if the six-month LIBOR is less than 7.35% (the "floor"). There
is no cost to either party while the six-month LIBOR is between 7.35% and 14%. 
At December 31, 1993, the effective six-month LIBOR rate under this agreement
was 3.50%. 

The interest rate swaps which expire in May 1996 discussed above offset
a portion of the cost of the floor and, as long as the six-month LIBOR remains
at or below the 7.35% floor rate, the net cost of the floor is fixed as the 
difference between 7.35% and the weighted average fixed rate under the swaps
of 6.59%. Amounts payable under the floor are netted against amounts
receivable under the interest rate swaps.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 45

The Company also has a $250 million interest rate swap in effect at
December 31, 1993 under which the Company receives six-month LIBOR and pays the
swap counterparty six-month LIBOR minus .37%. In the event that six-month LIBOR
increases by more than .50% on any semi-annual reset date, the amount the
Company receives for the subsequent six month period is capped at the previous
six-month LIBOR plus .50%. The purpose of this swap is to further reduce the
cost of the interest rate floor described above, however this swap exposes the
Company to incremental liability in the event that the six-month LIBOR
increases at a faster rate than .87% every six months. This swap expires in
May 1996. 

In 1989, the Company entered into a $50 million interest rate swap
contract and, at the inception of this agreement, received a $10,000,000
advance payment of the swap counterparty's obligations over the term of the
swap agreement, which amount is being repaid with interest as an adjustment to
the net interest settlements during the five year term of the swap. This
advance, net of a $150,000 arrangement fee, is being amortized on the interest
method over the term of the swap using the interest rate implicit in the 
payment adjustment. The unamortized amount of the advance included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
was $2,388,000 and $4,545,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 

In May 1991, the Company effectively terminated the $50 million interest
rate swap referred to above by entering into an offsetting $50 million interest
rate swap. The loss on termination of $1,312,000, which was equal to the
discounted present value of the net future payments under both swaps of
$435,000 annually, exclusive of the repayment of the $10,000,000 advance, is
being recognized over three and one-half years, the remaining term of both
swaps on the date of termination. The unrecognized loss on termination was
$354,000 and $740,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and the
remaining term of the two offsetting $50 million interest rate swaps at
December 31, 1993 was eleven months. 

Under the $25 million interest rate swap used to hedge floating rate
bank debt, the Company receives a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR and
pays the swap counterparty a fixed rate of 4.74%. This swap expires in July
1996.

Income (expense) recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income for interest rate swaps and the interest rate collar, including
periodic settlement amounts and realized and unrealized gains and losses 
recognized on interest rate swaps that do not qualify as hedges, is as follows:

NOTE J--STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

Under the terms of two stock option plans adopted by the Company's
stockholders in 1984, certain officers and key employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries may be granted options to purchase up to 1,246,292 shares of the
Company's common stock. Because the exercise price of all stock options
awarded under these plans can be no less than the fair market value of a share
of optioned stock at the date of grant, no compensation expense has been
recorded for these awards. Options expire no later than ten years after the
date of grant and no options can be granted after 1993.

In addition, one of the stock option plans provides for the granting of
stock appreciation rights ("SARs") on a maximum of 465,034 shares of the
Company's common stock. SARs entitle the holder to receive, upon exercise, a
cash payment equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the date of exercise over the option price. Compensation expense of
$31,000, $610,000 and $90,000 is included in the 1993, 1992 and 1991
consolidated statement of income, respectively, based on the difference between
the market value of the rights outstanding at the end of each year and the
option price and cash payments made during each year on SARs exercised.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 47

Information concerning stock options and SARs is as follows. All shares
and option prices have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to stock
dividends declared subsequent to the date of grant. Outstanding stock options
and SARs will expire over periods ending no later than November 2003.

NOTE K--DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In July 1990, the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"), an office of the
United States Department of Treasury, placed Statesman Bank for Savings, FSB
(the "savings bank"), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in
receivership and a new federal institution, operating under the oversight of
the Resolution Trust Corporation, assumed the savings bank's assets and
liabilities. The OTS action was predicated on its assertion that the savings
bank failed to meet the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements under
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989
("FIRREA") which became effective in December 1989. The Company had previously
capitalized the savings bank with $8,400,000 of cash and 126,000 shares of its
1988 Series Preferred Stock $1 Par (see Note E) in March 1988 for the purpose
of acquiring four failed thrift institutions with federal agency financial
assistance. The Company reduced the carrying value of its investment in the
savings bank to zero and recognized a loss on disposal in its 1990 consolidated
financial statements.

In August 1990, the Company filed suit in the United States Claims Court
(the "Claims Court") against the United States of America. The pending lawsuit
concerns contractual agreements which were made by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, former government
regulatory agencies that were abolished by FIRREA, to induce the Company to
capitalize the savings bank, for the purpose of acquiring the four failed
thrift institutions. In the lawsuit, the Company claims that the defendant has
breached its contractual agreements with respect to regulatory capital. 
Accordingly, the pending lawsuit contends that this breach of contract, which
resulted in the disallowance of $21 million of capital which the defendant
promised would be perpetual for regulatory accounting purposes, constitutes a
taking of the Company's property without just compensation and due process of
law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 48

The pending lawsuit seeks rescission of the transaction between the
Company and the government agencies and recovery of the Company's investment
plus compensation for monies expended, costs incurred and the value of benefits
conferred on the defendant through the Company's purchase, operation and
management of the savings bank. Total restitution sought exceeds $30 million. 

In July 1992, the Claims Court granted the Company's motion for summary
judgment as to the defendant's liability in the above-described lawsuit. The
Claims Court also consolidated this case with two others and certified these
cases for interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (the "Court of Appeals"). Subsequently, the Court of Appeals
reversed the order of the Claims Court by a margin of two to one and the
Company filed a Petition for Rehearing with Suggestion for Rehearing in Banc
(the "Rehearing Petition") with the Court of Appeals. On August 18, 1993, the
Court of Appeals accepted the Company's Rehearing Petition. The Court of
Appeals also vacated its judgment entered on May 25, 1993 in favor of the
defendant and withdrew its opinion accompanying the judgment. The rehearing
is currently scheduled for February 10, 1994.

In 1985, the Company sold Statesman Insurance Company, a former
property-casualty insurance subsidiary. As part of this sale and as part of
a certain reinsurance agreement between Statesman Insurance Company and another
former affiliate, the Company guaranteed and indemnified Statesman Insurance
Company that it would suffer no loss on the insurance liability reinsured by
it in excess of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves transferred to
the affiliate pursuant to the terms of the reinsurance agreement. The Company
does not believe that the ultimate settlement of the remaining outstanding
claims covered by this guarantee will materially exceed existing liabilities
provided for such contingency.

In 1989, the Company sold its investment banking and retail brokerage
subsidiary. The stock purchase agreement between the Company and the purchaser
provided in part that the Company could be required to indemnify the purchaser
for certain uncollectible receivables and debits of the former subsidiary and
certain claims by or against the former subsidiary. In 1990, the purchaser
filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy laws
and the Bankruptcy Trustee for the purchaser purported to assign the
purchaser's indemnification rights, if any, under the stock purchase agreement
to the former subsidiary.

In January 1991, the former subsidiary filed a declaratory judgement
action seeking indemnification by the Company with respect to certain claims
by or against the former subsidiary. The Company vigorously disputed its
former subsidiary's claim to indemnification and believes that it had
meritorious defenses to such claim. To avoid the cost and uncertainty of
long-term litigation, the Company entered into a settlement agreement and
release with the former subsidiary in October 1991. The charge related to the
settlement, including related attorneys' fees in excess of amounts previously
accrued at December 31, 1990, was recognized in the fourth quarter of 1991 as
a loss on disposal of subsidiaries and did not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Earnings per share amounts for each quarter are computed independently
of earnings per share amounts for the year. All per share amounts prior to the
fourth quarter of 1993 have been restated to give retroactive effect to the 5%
stock dividend paid in December 1993.

Amounts previously reported as discontinued operations for the first
three quarters of 1993 have been reclassified to be consistent with the year
end presentation.

Insurance operations are typically not seasonal in nature. However, the
recognition of realized gains and losses on investments may vary from quarter
to quarter as indicated above. Fourth quarter 1992 operations include
additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to
realized gains on investments of $4,125,000.

NOTE M -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT (UNAUDITED)

On September 29, 1994, CCP II completed the Acquisition of the Company. 
Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company's former stockholders
received $15.25 in cash per common equivalent share, plus the right to receive
up to another $2.00 in cash per common equivalent share based on the outcome
of the Company's pending litigation against the U. S. Government concerning the
Company's former savings bank subsidiary. CCP II is a Delaware limited
partnership which was formed by Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco") to invest in
acquisitions of annuity, life, and accident and health insurance companies and
related businesses. In connection with the Acquisition, the line of credit of
a subsidiary of the Company with a balance at the acquisition date of
approximately $54,800,000 was repaid.

The Acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase business combination
pursuant to which the reported values of the acquired assets and liabilities
of the Company are adjusted to their estimated fair values at the Acquisition
date. The Company incurred indebtedness aggregating $350 million to partially
finance the Acquisition. As such, future results of operations and the
financial condition of the Company may vary significantly from historical
reported results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company and certain of the persons then serving on the Board of
Directors have been named in a purported class action suit commenced on May 3,
1994 relating to the Acquisition. The complainant seeks injunctive relief and 
compensatory damages. The Company believes that such suit is without merit and
intends to contest it vigorously.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On September 29, 1994, Conseco Capital Partners II, L.P. ("CCP II"), a
Delaware limited partnership, completed the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of
The Statesman Group, Inc. ("Statesman"). After the Acquisition and related
financing transactions, CCP II owns approximately 80 percent of the outstanding
shares of Statesman's common stock. Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco") formed CCP II
in February 1994 with several other investors for the purpose of investing in
acquisitions of annuity, life and accident and health insurance companies and
related businesses. Conseco Partnership Management, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Conseco, is the sole general partner of CCP II. Because a
subsidiary of Conseco is the sole general partner of CCP II, Conseco controls
CCP II and Statesman. Accordingly, Conseco's consolidated financial statements
will include the accounts of CCP II and Statesman. Conseco, through its direct
investment and through its equity interest in the investments made by Bankers
Life Holding Corporation ("BLH"), CCP Insurance, Inc. ("CCP Insurance") and
Western National Corporation ("WNC"), has a 27 percent ownership interest in
Statesman. The remaining 73 percent ownership interest in Statesman is
described as the "Statesman Minority Interest."

The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations of Conseco
for the year ended December 31, 1993, and the six months ended June 30, 1994,
present the consolidated operating results for Conseco as if the Acquisition
had occurred on January 1, 1993. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance
sheet as of June 30, 1994, gives effect to the Acquisition as if it had
occurred on June 30, 1994. The historical statement of operations data for
Conseco set forth in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1993, and for the six months ended
June 30, 1994, under the column "Pro Forma Conseco Before the Statesman
Acquisition", to which the pro forma adjustments for the Acquisition are being
applied, already reflect the prior application of certain pro forma adjustments
for the following transactions, all of which occurred prior to June 30, 1994,
as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 1993: the initial public
offering of WNC, the initial public offering of BLH, the purchase by Conseco
of 13.3 million additional shares of BLH common stock in September 1993 and the
purchase by Conseco of 2.0 million additional shares of CCP Insurance common
stock in September 1993. These pro forma adjustments are set forth in Exhibit
99.1 to Conseco's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 1994. 

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the accompanying notes, the historical financial statements
and notes thereto of Conseco, the historical financial statements of Statesman
as of June 30, 1994, and for the six months then ended and for the year ended
December 31, 1993 included in Item 7(a) herein, and the unaudited pro forma
financial information of Conseco as of June 30, 1994, and for the six months
then ended and for the year ended December 31, 1993, contained in Exhibit 99.1
to Conseco's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 1994. Certain
amounts from the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation. 

PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

Transactions Relating to the Acquisition of Statesman

The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated May 1, 1994, providing for the merger of Statesman with a
subsidiary of CCP II. Statesman's former stockholders received $15.25 in cash
per common equivalent share plus a contingent payment right to receive up to
another $2.00 in cash per common equivalent share ("the Contingent
Consideration") based on the outcome of Statesman's pending litigation against
the U.S. Government concerning Statesman's former savings bank subsidiary (the
"Government Litigation").
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 58

The Acquisition and related transactions were funded with: (i) $45.0
million of cash contributions made to CCP II by its partners (including $7.2
million provided by wholly owned subsidiaries of Conseco, $1.8 million by BLH,
$1.8 million by CCP Insurance and $3.6 million by WNC), (ii) $57.0 million in
cash from the sale in a private placement of the payment-in-kind preferred
stock of Statesman (the "Statesman PIK Preferred Stock") (including $25.9
million purchased by BLH and $24.0 million purchased by CCP Insurance), (iii)
$150.0 million in cash from the sale in a public offering by ALHC Merger
Corporation, a subsidiary of CCP II which was merged into American Life Holding
Company ("ALHC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Statesman, of its 11-1/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2004 (the "ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes") and (iv)
$200.0 million in cash from a senior secured loan (the "ALHC Senior Term Loan")
obtained by ALHC Merger Corporation (collectively referred to herein as the
"Statesman Financing"). The sources and uses of this financing are summarized
below (dollars in millions).
<TABLE>
<S> <C> 
Sources of Funds:
ALHC Senior Term Loan:
Borrowed upon closing of the Acquisition $170.0
Borrowed upon determination of Government Litigation 30.0 (i)
ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes 150.0
Statesman PIK Preferred Stock 57.0
Common equity contribution from CCP II 45.0
------
Total sources $452.0
======

Uses of Funds:
Payment of cash consideration to acquire Statesman $314.1 (ii)
Payment upon determination of Government Litigation 30.1 (i)
Repayment of bank indebtedness of a subsidiary of Statesman 55.5 (iii)
Transaction fees and expenses 14.8
Purchase of surplus note from American Life and Casualty 
Insurance Company ("American Life"), Statesman's 
principal operating subsidiary 24.0
Cash retained 13.5
------
Total uses $452.0
======
<FN>

(i) In the event of an unfavorable determination of the Government 
Litigation, $30.1 million would be paid to the holders of Statesman's
1988 Series I and II Preferred Stock $1 Par (the "Statesman 1988 Series
Preferred Stock"), which is currently held by the U.S. Government. In 
the event of a favorable determination of this litigation, the same
amount, representing a portion of the Contingent Consideration, would
be paid to the other former stockholders of Statesman.

(ii) This amount assumes conversion of all outstanding 6-1/4% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due 2003 of Statesman (the "Convertible
Debentures"), which are convertible into an aggregate of 4,528,125
shares of Statesman common stock. To the extent that any holders of
the Convertible Debentures do not convert such securities, the
proceeds which would have been used to pay such holders will be held
in escrow until the Convertible Debentures are converted by the
holders, are redeemed by Statesman, or mature.

(iii) A subsidiary of Statesman was the borrower under a credit facility with
an outstanding balance of $51.9 million at June 30, 1994. The 
outstanding balance under this facility (which totalled $55.5 million
at the Acquisition date) was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from
the Statesman Financing.
</TABLE>
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 59

The pro forma adjustments are applied to the historical consolidated
financial statements of Conseco and Statesman to account for the Acquisition
using the purchase method of accounting. Under purchase accounting, the total
purchase cost of Statesman will be allocated to the assets and liabilities
acquired based on their relative fair values as of the date of acquisition,
with any excess of the total purchase cost over the fair value of the assets
acquired less the fair value of the liabilities assumed recorded as goodwill. 
The cost allocations will be based on appraisals and other studies, which are
not yet completed. Accordingly, the final allocations will be different from
the amounts reflected herein. Although the final allocations will differ, the
pro forma consolidated financial statements reflect management's best estimate
based on currently available information.

Adjustments to give effect to the Acquisition and related transactions
are summarized as follows: 

(1) Amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the recognition of
deferred revenues for policies sold by Statesman prior to January 1, 1993, are
replaced with the amortization of cost of policies purchased (amortized in 
relation to estimated profits on the policies purchased with interest equal
to the liability or contract rates ranging from 5.3% to 8.2%). See Note 16
below.

(2) Net investment income and net realized gains of Statesman are
adjusted to include the effect of the restatement of (i) fixed maturities, (ii)
mortgage loan investments and (iii) interest rate swap and collar agreements
to estimated fair value as of January 1, 1993, the assumed date of the
Acquisition. The reported value and estimated fair value of fixed maturities,
mortgage loan investments and interest rate swap and collar agreements as of
January 1, 1993, are as follows (dollars in millions):
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Reported Estimated
Value Fair Value
----- ----------
<S> <C> <C>
Fixed maturities $2,910.6 $2,980.0
Mortgage loan investments 87.1 88.2
Interest rate swap and collar agreements (.7) (7.5)
</TABLE>

In addition, net investment income is reduced to reflect the reduction
in short-term investments in connection with the purchase of investments in CCP
II and the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock by Conseco and its consolidated
subsidiaries. Additionally, equity in earnings of CCP Insurance is reduced to
reflect the reduction in net investment income as a result of its investment
in CCP II and the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock. 

No additional investment income is assumed to be earned on the cash
retained from the proceeds of the Statesman Financing after payment of the
costs of the Acquisition and related transactions. Pro forma net realized gain
(loss) represents the difference between (i) the actual proceeds from the sales
of investments and (ii) the fair value of the investments as of the assumed
date of the Acquisition, adjusted for the accretion of discount or premium
based on the new cost basis.

(3) Interest expense is adjusted to reflect the following transactions
as if they occurred as of the assumed date of the Acquisition:

<FN>

(i) Based on borrowings of $170.0 million ($130.0 million at an
assumed interest rate of 7.0% and $40.0 million at an assumed
interest rate of 7.5%).

(ii) Based on a principal amount of $150.0 million at an assumed
interest rate of 11.25%.

(iii) Based on debt issuance costs of $6.8 million and $8.0 million
related to the ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes and the ALHC 
Senior Term Loan, respectively, which are amortized at a level
yield over the term of such debt.
</TABLE>

A change in interest rates on the ALHC Senior Term Loan of .5% would
result in (i) an increase (or decrease) in pro forma interest expense of $.9
million and $.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six months
ended June 30, 1994, respectively, and (ii) a decrease (or increase) in pro
forma net income of $.1 million and $.1 million for the same respective
periods. Under the terms of the ALHC Senior Term Loan, $30 million will remain
available to borrow at a later date when needed to pay a portion of the
Contingent Consideration or to pay to the holders of the Statesman 1988 Series
Preferred Stock upon the determination of the Government Litigation. If such
$30 million were outstanding during 1993 and the six months ended June 30, 1994
(with an assumed interest rate of 7.0% during such periods), pro forma interest
expense would increase by $2.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and pro
forma net income would decrease by $.3 million and $.2 million, respectively.

(4) Amortization of goodwill calculated as of January 1, 1993 is
recognized over a 40-year period on a straight-line basis.

(5) Anticipated returns, including realized gains and losses, from the
investment of policyholder balances are considered in determining the
amortization of the cost of policies purchased. Amortization of cost of
policies purchased is adjusted to reflect amortization related to pro forma
realized gains by Statesman during the period. 

(6) All applicable pro forma adjustments to operations are tax effected
at the appropriate rate. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 1993,
income tax expense is increased by $1.1 million to reflect the effect of the
increase in the corporate income tax rate to 35% from 34% on adjustments to
deferred income tax liabilities resulting from pro forma adjustments.

(7) The Statesman Minority Interest in the earnings of Statesman is
recognized. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 61

(8) After the Acquisition, investment advisory services are provided to
Statesman by a subsidiary of Conseco. Statesman's historical net investment
income is not reduced to reflect the advisory fees to be paid under the
agreement in excess of investment expenses incurred prior to the Acquisition,
since, in accordance with GAAP, such intercompany fees are eliminated in
consolidation. Minority interest, however, is adjusted to charge the Statesman
Minority Interest for its portion of such investment advisory fees. Net
investment income is not increased to reflect any additional investment income
and realized gains which may be earned as a result of services provided by the
Conseco subsidiary.

(9) All investors in the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock, other than BLH
and CCP Insurance to the extent of Conseco's interest therein, have 
approximately a 56 percent ownership interest in such Statesman PIK Preferred
Stock (the "Statesman PIK Preferred Minority Interest"). Income is reduced to
reflect the dividends accrued on the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock attributable
to the Statesman PIK Preferred Minority Interest. 

(10) After the Acquisition, all existing fixed maturity investments are
classified as available-for-sale. Fixed maturities previously classified as
held-to-maturity are reclassified as available-for-sale. 

(11) Statesman's fixed maturity investments, mortgage loans, property
and equipment and securities segregated for the future redemption of preferred
stock of a wholly owned subsidiary are restated to market value as of the
assumed date of the Acquisition. 

(12) After the Acquisition, all cash is invested in short-term
investments. Short-term investments are increased to reflect the gross
proceeds from the Statesman Financing.

(13) Short-term investments are reduced for the amounts distributed
related to the Acquisition.

(14) Short-term investments are reduced to reflect the investment of
Conseco and its consolidated subsidiaries in CCP II related to the Acquisition
and in Statesman PIK Preferred Stock, offset by fees of $4.9 million paid to
Conseco. Retained earnings is increased by $2.3 million to reflect net income
attributable to the fees collected from the Statesman Minority Interest.

(15) All of the applicable pro forma balance sheet adjustments are tax
effected at the appropriate rate. 

(16) Cost of policies purchased reflects the estimated fair value of
the business in force and represents the portion of the cost to acquire
Statesman that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash
flows from insurance contracts existing as of the assumed date of the
Acquisition. Such value is the present value of the actuarially determined
projected cash flows from the acquired policies.

The 15% discount rate used to determine such value is the rate of return
required by CCP II to invest in the business being acquired. In determining
such rate of return, the following factors are considered: 

-- The magnitude of the risks associated with each of the actuarial
assumptions used in determining expected future cash flows.

-- Cost of capital available to fund the acquisition.

-- The perceived likelihood of changes in insurance regulations and
tax laws.

-- Complexity of the acquired company.

-- Prices paid (i.e., discount rates used in determining
valuations) on similar blocks of business sold recently.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 62

The value allocated to cost of policies purchased is based on a
preliminary valuation; accordingly, this allocation may be adjusted upon final
determination of such value. On a pro forma basis, assuming that the
Acquisition occurred as of June 30, 1994, expected gross amortization using
current assumptions and accretion of interest based on an interest rate equal
to the liability or contract rate (such rates ranging from 5.3% to 7.7%) for
each of the years in the five-year period ending June 30, 1999 is as follows
(dollars in millions):
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Year ended Beginning Gross Accretion Net Ending
June 30 Balance Amortization of Interest Amortization Balance
------- ------- ------------ ----------- ------------ -------
<S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C>
1995 $478.2 $68.5 $24.9 $43.6 $434.6
1996 434.6 69.6 22.0 47.6 387.0
1997 387.0 65.7 19.5 46.2 340.8
1998 340.8 61.4 17.1 44.3 296.5
1999 296.5 56.2 14.8 41.4 255.1
</TABLE>

(17) Deferred acquisition costs of Statesman are eliminated since such
amounts are reflected in the determination of the cost of policies purchased. 

(18) Goodwill reflects the excess of cost of investment in Statesman
over the net assets acquired.

(19) Several deferred costs of Statesman that are not relevant after
the acquisition are eliminated as of the assumed date of the Acquisition.

(20) A liability is established to reflect the fair value of interest
rate swap and collar agreements of Statesman outstanding as of the assumed date
of the Acquisition. The fair value was determined based on estimates obtained
from an unaffiliated dealer in such instruments.

(21) Deferred revenues on certain life insurance and annuity policies
of Statesman are eliminated, since such amounts are reflected in the
determination of the cost of policies purchased.

(22) A liability is established for the amount payable when the outcome
of the Government Litigation is determined. 

(23) Long-term debt is reduced as of June 30, 1994 to reflect the
repayment of the bank debt of a subsidiary of Statesman (with a principal
balance as of June 30, 1994 of $51.9 million), repayment of notes payable
issued by Statesman's employee stock ownership plan (principal balance as of
June 30, 1994 of $4.0 million) and the assumed conversion and retirement of the
Convertible Debentures. Additionally, long-term debt is increased to reflect
(i) $170.0 million gross proceeds from the ALHC Senior Term Loan and (ii)
$150.0 million gross proceeds from the ALHC Senior Subordinated Notes, reduced
by $14.8 million to reflect the costs associated with the issuance of such
debt. Under the terms of the ALHC Senior Term Loan, $30.0 million will remain
available to borrow when needed to pay a portion of the Contingent
Consideration or to pay to the holder of the Statesman 1988 Series Preferred
Stock upon the determination of the Government Litigation. See Note 22 above.

(24) An adjustment is made to reflect the Statesman Minority Interest
in the common equity of Statesman and the Statesman PIK Preferred Minority
Interest related to the Statesman PIK Preferred Stock.

(25) The carrying value of the preferred stock of a wholly owned
subsidiary of Statesman is adjusted to its estimated fair value as of the
assumed date of the Acquisition. 

(26) The prior shareholders' equity and the redeemable preferred stock
of Statesman are eliminated in conjunction with the Acquisition and related
transactions.<PAGE>

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made
and entered into as of May 1, 1994 by and among CONSECO CAPITAL
PARTNERS II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("CCP II"), CCP
II ACQUISITION COMPANY, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of CCP II ("CCP II Acquisition"), and THE STATESMAN
GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). CCP II
Acquisition and the Company are sometimes referred to collectively
herein as the "Constituent Corporations."

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Conseco
Partnership Management, Inc., an Indiana corporation and the sole
general partner of CCP II ("CPMI"), CCP II Acquisition and the
Company have approved the merger of CCP II Acquisition with and
into the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; and

WHEREAS, CPMI, CCP II, CCP II Acquisition and the Company
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with such merger and also to prescribe
various conditions to such merger;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "Delaware Code") and the separate
corporate existence of CCP II Acquisition shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under the laws

event later than 10 business days thereafter, by the filing of a
duly executed Certificate of Merger in proper form required by the
Delaware Code with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean

2.3. Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
separate existence of CCP II Acquisition shall cease and the
Constituent Corporations shall be merged into the Surviving
Corporation, with the Surviving Corporation possessing all the
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of both a public and
private nature, and being subject to all the restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of such corporations so merged; and
all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of each of the
Constituent Corporations, and all property, real, personal and
mixed, and all debts due to any of said Constituent Corporations on
whatever account, as well for stock subscriptions as all other
things in action or belonging to each of such Constituent
Corporations shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation; and all
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and all other
interests shall be thereafter as effectually the property of the
Surviving Corporation as they were of the several and respective
Constituent Corporations, and the title to any real estate vested
by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the State of Delaware, in
any of such Constituent Corporations, shall not revert or in any
way be impaired by reason of the Merger. All rights of creditors
and all liens upon any property of any of the Constituent
Corporations shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts,
liabilities, and duties of the respective Constituent Corporations
shall attach to the Surviving Corporation, and may be enforced
against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and
duties had been incurred or contracted by it. The Surviving
Corporation shall be substituted in any action or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, pending by or against
any of the Constituent Corporations.

Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of

2.7 Officers. The officers of the Company at the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

2.8 Conversion of Shares, Preferred Stock, Options and SARs. 
(a) Each of the Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares held as treasury shares by
the Company or held by any direct or indirect majority-owned
subsidiary of the Company and other than Appraisal Shares, as
defined in Section 2.10 hereof) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into (i) a right to receive $15.25 in cash (the "Cash Merger
Consideration") payable to the holder thereof, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such Share
or Shares at any time after the Effective Time and (ii) a right to
receive a contingent right to receive up to $2.00 in future cash
distributions as set forth in Section 2.9 hereof (a "Contingent
Payment Right").

(b) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time which is then held as a treasury share by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, be
canceled and retired and cease to exist, without any conversion

entitled to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.8(a).

(c) Each Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not such Option is then vested or
exercisable, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and converted into
(i) the right to receive in cash an amount equal to (x) the
difference between (A) the Cash Merger Consideration and (B) the
exercise price of such Option multiplied by (y) the number of
Shares covered by the Option and (ii) the right to receive a
Contingent Payment Right for each Share covered by the Option.

(d) Each SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not such SAR is then vested or exercisable, shall,

receive in cash an amount equal to (x) the difference between (A)
the Cash Merger Consideration and (B) the exercise price of such
SAR multiplied by (y) the number of Shares subject to such SAR and
(ii) the right to receive a Contingent Payment Right for each Share
subject to such SAR.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use
its best efforts to obtain any consents from holders of Options and
SARs granted under the Company's stock or compensation plans or
arrangements, and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of such
stock or compensation plans or arrangements that, in the case of
either clauses (i) or (ii), are necessary to give effect to the
conversions contemplated by Section 2.8(c) and (d). 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.8, payment
may be withheld in respect of any Option or SAR until any necessary

payable to the holder thereof, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share and (ii) the
right to receive a Contingent Payment Right for each Share into
which such 1976 Series Preferred Share or 1987 Series Preferred
Share, as the case may be, was convertible immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

2.9 Contingent Payment Rights. (a)Appointment of Trustee;
Issuance of the Note. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall appoint a trustee (the "Trustee"), to serve as such from and
after the Effective Time, for the Persons entitled to receive Con-
tingent Payment Rights (the "Rights Holders") pursuant to Section
2.8. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deliv-
er to the Trustee for the benefit of the Rights Holders a contin-
gent payment note (the "Note"), a form of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit B. The Trustee shall hold, receive and make payments
with respect to the Note as provided in a note trust agreement (the
"Note Trust Agreement") which shall provide for the matters set
forth in this Section 2.9 and otherwise shall be on terms reason-
ably satisfactory to CCP II and the Company and which shall be
entered into on or before the Effective Time.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10
(b) Nature of the Rights. The Contingent Payment Rights
shall be non-transferable (other than pursuant to the laws of
descent and distribution or by operation of law or by the trustee
of any Benefit Plan to any participant or successor Benefit Plan
pursuant to the operation of such plan), shall be governed solely
by the terms of this Agreement, the Note and the Note Trust Agree-
ment and shall not be represented by any certificate or other
instrument.

(c) Principal Balance of the Note and Adjustments. The
outstanding principal balance of the Note (the "Principal Balance")
shall initially be $46,000,000 and shall not bear interest. The
Principal Balance shall be increased or decreased, as the case may
be, as provided in this Section 2.9 and the Note Trust Agreement. 
Any required increases or decreases to the Principal Balance (each,
an "Adjustment") shall be made by the Trustee on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation and the Rights Holders in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.9(e) by the amounts set forth in
this Section 2.9(c) below:

(i) the Principal Balance shall be decreased by an
amount equal to all payments made by the Surviving Corporation
on account of cumulative unpaid dividends, redemption value or
conversion value, or otherwise, to the holder of record at the
Effective Time of the Company's 1988 Series I Preferred Shares
or 1988 Series II Preferred Shares (other than such shares
held by, or any such payments made to, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary); provided, however, that if
such holder of the 1988 Series I Preferred Shares and 1988
Series II Preferred Shares exercises its right to convert such
Preferred Shares to Shares prior to the Effective Time and it
is determined in a Partial Litigation Resolution or Final
Litigation Resolution that such holder's Shares are entitled
to receive payments in respect of their Contingent Payment
Rights and are included in the pro rata calculation in Section
2.9(g)(iv) by the terms thereof, no reduction shall be made to
the Principal Balance pursuant to this clause (i) relating to
such payments; provided, further, that in all other cases in
which it is determined in a Partial Litigation Resolution or
Final Litigation Resolution that such holder is entitled to
receive payments with respect to Contingent Payment Rights on
the same basis as if such Preferred Shares had been converted
to Shares prior to the Effective Time, the reduction to the
Principal Balance relating to payments on the Contingent
Payment Rights of such holder shall be equal to the amount
obtained by making the pro rata calculation in 2.9(g)(iv)
assuming (A) such holder's 1988 Series I Preferred Shares and
1988 Series II Preferred Shares are included therein (on an
as-converted basis) and (B) no payments were made for the
Contingent Payment Rights of such holder.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 11
(ii) the Principal Balance shall be (A) decreased
by the amount by which the total cash proceeds and fair market
value of any other consideration or amounts received by the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, excluding any recov-
ery relating to the return or cancellation of the 1988 Series
I Preferred Shares or 1988 Series II Preferred Shares by the
holder to the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary (in the
aggregate, the "Recovery Amount") in the lawsuit against the
United States of America currently pending in the United
States Court of Claims as disclosed in the Filed SEC
Documents, or in any other court to which such proceedings may
be transferred (the "Company Litigation") is less than Sixteen
Million Dollars ($16,000,000) or (B) increased by the amount
by which the Recovery Amount is greater than Sixteen Million
Dollars ($16,000,000). For purposes of this Section
2.9(c)(ii), "fair market value of any other consideration or
amounts received" shall be determined in good faith by mutual
agreement of the Surviving Corporation and the Committee;

(iii) the Principal Balance shall be decreased by
an amount equal to all out-of-pocket costs and expenses rea-
sonably incurred by the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary after December 31, 1993, including, without limita-
tion, all reasonable legal or other professional fees and
costs and travel expenses incurred by the Surviving Corpora-
tion in connection with prosecuting or settling the Company
Litigation, to the extent such costs and expenses (A) are in
excess of $400,000 (the accrued expense liability established
in preparing the balance sheets of the Insurance Subsidiaries
in accordance with SAP as of December 31, 1993) and (B) are
not recovered by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
in such Company Litigation (collectively, "Costs and Expens-
es");

(iv) The Principal Balance shall be decreased by
(A) all costs and expenses of the Trustee and the Committee
which are reimbursed by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
Sections 2.9(k) and 2.9(l) hereof and (B) all payments in
respect of the Surviving Corporation's indemnification
obligations under Section 2.9(m) or Section 2.9(n); provided,
however, that the Principal Balance shall not be decreased as
a result of costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee or the
Committee and reimbursed by the Surviving Corporation under
Sections 2.9(k) and 2.9(l) or indemnification payments made by
the Surviving Corporation under Sections 2.9(m) or 2.9(n), if
such costs and expenses or indemnification payments are
related to the Trustee's or the Committee's enforcing against
the Surviving Corporation their respective rights to collect
or the Surviving Corporation's obligations to make payments
due under Section 2.9(g);
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 12
(v) the Principal Balance shall be decreased by
$150,000 on the first anniversary date of the Effective Time
and by $100,000 on each of the next three succeeding
anniversary dates thereafter; provided, that, if the
Adjustment is calculated other than on an anniversary date,
the decrease shall be prorated based on the actual days
elapsed from the preceding anniversary date to the date the
Adjustment is determined;

(vi) the Principal Balance shall be decreased by an
amount equal to the difference (if positive) between (A) all
federal income taxes payable with respect to the cash proceeds
and other consideration or amounts received by the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary with respect to the Company
Litigation assuming that no net operating loss is utilized in
such calculation, and (B) any allowable decrease in federal
income taxes payable by the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary attributable to payments, costs and expenses, as
the case may be, referred to above in Section 2.9(c),
including any amounts under Section (c)(v); and

(vii) the Principal Balance shall be decreased by
the amount of any Principal Payment made by the Surviving
Corporation to the Rights Holders under the Note.

(d) Settlement Procedures.

(i) In the course of prosecuting or settling the
Company Litigation, the Surviving Corporation shall consult
with the Committee regarding the status of such Company
Litigation and any pending negotiations with respect thereto
and provide to the Committee any applicable documents and
other information so as to permit the Committee to evaluate
the status of such Company Litigation.

(ii) In addition to the requirements of Section
2.9(d)(i) above, neither CCP II nor the Surviving Corporation
shall enter into or agree to any settlement which would give
rise to an Adjustment Event under Section 2.9, without the
prior written consent of the Committee (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld).

(e) Procedures Regarding Adjustments.

(i) No Adjustments shall be made except those made
in compliance with this Agreement, including, without
limitation, this Section 2.9(e).
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 13
(ii) Within 30 days following a Partial Litigation
Resolution or the Final Litigation Resolution, the Surviving
Corporation shall give the Trustee and the Committee written
notice (an "Adjustment Notice") setting forth (A) the amount
of the proposed Adjustment ("Proposed Adjustment"), (B) a
summary of the Adjustment Events giving rise to the Proposed
Adjustment and (C) copies of all relevant documentation in the
possession of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or
any of their respective legal or financial advisors relating
to the Adjustment Events and Proposed Adjustment.

(iii) If the Committee objects to such Proposed
Adjustment, it shall give written notice of its objection to
the Trustee and the Surviving Corporation within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Adjustment Notice. If the Committee
so notifies the Surviving Corporation and the Trustee of its
objection to the Proposed Adjustment, the Surviving Corpora-
tion and the Committee shall, within 30 days following such
notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt in good faith to re-
solve the dispute and any resolution by them as to any disput-
ed items shall be final and binding. Any amounts remaining in
dispute after the Resolution Period shall be resolved by
binding arbitration pursuant to Section 2.9(f) hereof. No
Adjustment to the Principal Balance shall be made by the
Trustee until the objection is withdrawn, the dispute is set-
tled between the parties and notice of such settlement is
provided to the Trustee or an arbitration award with respect
thereto shall have been issued and a copy provided to the
Trustee. The Trustee shall, on the tenth (10th) day following
the date on which the Trustee receives the withdrawal of the
objection, notice of settlement or copy of the arbitration
award, as the case may be, adjust the Principal Balance in
accordance with and as directed by such withdrawal, notice of
settlement or arbitration award, as the case may be.

(iv) If no objection to a Proposed Adjustment shall
have been received by the Trustee within thirty (30) days
after the date of the applicable Adjustment Notice, the
Committee shall be deemed to have acknowledged the correctness
of and accepted such Adjustment, and the Trustee shall, on the
thirty-fifth (35th) day following the date of the Adjustment
Notice, increase or reduce the Principal Balance by the amount
of the Adjustment.

(v) Prior to a Principal Payment in connection with
the Final Litigation Resolution, if after an Adjustment has
been made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, but
within 360 days from the date of the Adjustment, circumstances
change or facts are discovered resulting in the Adjustment
being inapplicable or inappropriate, in whole or in part, then
upon 30 days notice by the Committee or the Surviving Corpora-
tion, as the case may be, to the Trustee and the other Person,
either party may request a reconsideration of the Adjustment. 
The parties shall follow similar procedures regarding the
reconsideration as were applicable with respect to the
Proposed Adjustment.

<PAGE> 14
(f) Binding Arbitration. Any dispute between the
Committee and the Surviving Corporation arising under or
related in any way to the Contingent Payment Rights under 
Sections 2.9(c) and (e) shall be submitted to a firm of
nationally recognized independent public accountants (the
"Neutral Auditors") selected by the Surviving Corporation and
the Committee for binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois. 
If the Surviving Corporation and the Committee are unable to
agree on the Neutral Auditors, the Surviving Corporation and
the Committee shall each have the right to request the Ameri-
can Arbitration Association to appoint the Neutral Auditors
who shall not have had a material relationship with the
Surviving Corporation, CCP II or any of their respective
affiliates within the past four years. Each party agrees to
execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable
engagement letter. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditors shall be
borne equally by the Surviving Corporation and the Committee. 
The Neutral Auditors may upon application compel the pro-
duction of relevant, non-privileged documents or other
evidence and a disclosure of a complete list of witnesses who
may testify at hearings. The party seeking such discovery may
be ordered to pay the reasonable costs thereof. The Neutral
Auditor's determination rendered in these proceedings shall be
made within 60 days of their selection, shall be set forth in
a written statement delivered to the Surviving Corporation and
the Committee, shall be final, binding and conclusive and
shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(g) Payment Dates; Payment Procedures.

(i) Upon the occurrence of (A) each partial
resolution of the Company Litigation, whether by settlement or
final non-appealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction (a "Partial Litigation Resolution") or (B) the
final resolution of the Company Litigation, whether by
settlement or final non-appealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction (the "Final Litigation Resolution"),
the Note shall become due and payable (a "Principal Payment")
to the Trustee in an amount equal to the then Principal
Balance, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.9(c), less any
amounts that the Committee and the Surviving Corporation shall
agree in good faith are reasonably required as a reserve to
cover any remaining unresolved Adjustment Events pursuant to
Section 2.9(c). The Principal Payment required to be made
pursuant to this paragraph (g)(i) shall be paid within 10
business days after the Adjustments have been determined
pursuant to Section 2.9(e).

(ii) If any Principal Payment is not made within
three (3) days of the date when due pursuant to paragraph
(g)(i) above, the unpaid installment of such Principal Balance
shall bear interest from the date due until paid at a rate of
ten percent (10%) per annum.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 15
(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.9 to the contrary, if the Committee and the Sur-
viving Corporation shall mutually agree (in writing signed by
the parties) to modify, add or supplement the terms and
provisions regarding Adjustments of and payments on the
Principal Balance, then the Principal Balance shall be
adjusted and paid in accordance with such modified, additional
or supplemental terms.

(iv) Upon receipt of any Principal Payment pursuant
to Section 2.9(g)(i), the Trustee shall immediately deposit
all of such funds ("Proceeds") in a segregated account in
accordance with the Note Trust Agreement. Within thirty (30)
days of the receipt of any Proceeds, the Trustee shall make
payments of cash to the Rights Holders. All payments to
Rights Holders hereunder shall be made pro rata to each Rights
Holder pursuant to the following formula: the then balance of
the Proceeds times a fraction, the numerator of which is the
sum of (A) the number of Shares held of record by such Rights
Holder at the Effective Time, (B) the number of Shares into
which all 1976 Series Preferred Shares and 1987 Series Pre-
ferred Shares held of record by such Rights Holder at the
Effective Time are convertible immediately prior to the Effec-
tive Time, (C) the number of Shares covered by all Options
held by such Rights Holder at the Effective Time and (D) the
number of Shares subject to all SARs held by such Rights
Holder at the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is
the sum of (I) the number of Shares held of record by all
Rights Holders at the Effective Time, (II) the number of
Shares into which all 1976 Series Preferred Shares and 1987
Series Preferred Shares held of record by all Rights Holders
at the Effective Time are convertible immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (III) the number of Shares covered by all Op-
tions held by all Rights Holders at the Effective Time, (IV)
the number of Shares subject to all SARs held by all Rights
Holders at the Effective Time and (V) the number of Shares
into which all issued and outstanding Convertible Debentures
at the Effective Time were convertible immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Any payments of cash pursuant to this
Section 2.9(g)(iv) shall be made to each Rights Holder by
check drawn by the Trustee payable to the order of the Rights
Holder and mailed to such person at the address shown on the
list referred to in the Note Trust Agreement. Ten (10) days
prior to the date the Trustee mails payments to Rights
Holders, the Trustee shall publish a general notice that such
payments are being made, in a daily newspaper of national
circulation, which shall be The Wall Street Journal, unless it
is not then so circulated. Any monies on deposit with the
Trustee in respect of any Principal Payment shall be invested
by the Trustee as provided in the Note Trust Agreement. In
the event any checks representing a payment of Contingent
Payment Rights shall not be presented for payment, the Trustee
shall hold such cash in the segregated account without liabil-
ity to the Rights Holders for interest thereon, for the
benefit of the respective Rights Holders. After any such cash
has been held in such segregated account for nine (9) months
after the final distribution of checks to Rights Holders, the
Trustee shall certify the respective amounts thereof and the
identity of the Rights Holders and deliver such certificate
and such cash to the Surviving Corporation. Thereafter, such
Rights Holders shall have an unsecured claim against the
Surviving Corporation in respect of payment of such cash.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 16
(v) Upon payment by the Surviving Corporation to
the Trustee of any remaining Principal Balance pursuant to
Section 2.9(g)(i), the Note shall be canceled and returned to
the Surviving Corporation and all of the Surviving Corpora-
tion's obligations under this Section 2.9 shall be fully
satisfied and discharged, except with respect to its
obligations pursuant to Sections 2.9(k), (l), (m) and (n),
which shall remain in full force and effect.

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.9 or the Note Trust Agreement, at such time as the
Surviving Corporation shall have made aggregate Principal Pay-
ments equal to $2.00 multiplied by the aggregate number of
Contingent Payment Rights, the Note shall be canceled and re-
turned to the Surviving Corporation and all of the Surviving
Corporation's obligations under this Section 2.9 shall be
fully satisfied and discharged, except with respect to its
obligations pursuant to Sections 2.9(k), (l), (m) and (n),
which shall remain in full force and effect. No Principal
Payment shall be required to be made, if the Principal Balance
does not then exceed $1,000,000. If such Principal Balance
does not exceed $1,000,000 on the fourth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Note shall be canceled and returned to
the Surviving Corporation and all of the Surviving
Corporation's obligations under this Section 2.9 shall be
fully satisfied and discharged, except with respect to its
obligations under Sections 2.9(k), (l), (m) and (n), which
shall remain in full force and effect.

(h) Obligations of the Surviving Corporation. After the

required to post any bond or other security with respect to
its or their duties and responsibilities hereunder.

(v) If, prior to the Effective Time, any member of
the Committee shall resign, die or become incapacitated or

remaining members are unable to agree on a successor, the
Trustee, in its capacity as a fiduciary for the Rights
Holders, shall also be entitled to vote to select a third

rights, powers, immunities and privileges as was his or her
predecessor, without the need of any further act or writing.

and Expenses and in such event the Note shall remain in full force
and effect and any such amounts so advanced shall be repaid to the
Committee by the Surviving Corporation out of any amount recovered
by the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary in the Company

Code, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
each Share or Preferred Share which is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is held by a
holder, who has timely filed with the Company a written demand for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware Code ("Section
262") and, as of the Effective Time, has not failed to perfect or
effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's appraisal rights under

Share shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive
the consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.8
hereof and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights
as are granted by Section 262. Each holder of Appraisal Shares who
becomes entitled to payment for such Appraisal Shares pursuant to
the provisions of Section 262 shall receive payment therefor from
the Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount thereof shall
have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such
provisions). The Company shall give CCP II (i) prompt notice of
any demands received from any shareholder pursuant to such
provisions and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to such
provisions. If the holder of Appraisal Shares shall have failed to
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder's
right to appraisal and payment for such Shares under Section 262,
each such Share or Preferred Share shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and represent
the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.8.

2.11 Conversion of CCP II Acquisition Common Stock. All of
the shares of common stock, no par value per share, of CCP II
Acquisition issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
exchangeable for a number of shares of common stock, $1 par value
per share, of the Surviving Corporation equal to the number of
shares of common stock, $1 par value per share, of the Company,
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
Shares held by any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of
the Company.

2.12 Shareholders' Meeting. (a) The Company, acting through
its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law:
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 21
(i) (A) duly call and give notice of a special
meeting (the "Special Meeting") of its shareholders, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, for the purpose of voting upon the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger
and (B) thereafter convene and hold the Special Meeting;

(ii) include in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter
defined) sent to shareholders of the Company the
recommendation of its Board of Directors that
shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger; and

(iii) use its best efforts as promptly as
practicable (A) to obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by it in the Proxy Statement, and
(x) file the Proxy Statement with the applicable
regulatory authorities, (y) respond promptly to any
comments made by the applicable regulatory authorities
with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary
version thereof and (z) cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its shareholders in accordance with Subsection
2.12(a)(i)(A) above and (B) to have the necessary vote on
this Agreement and the Merger by its shareholders.

(b) CCP II shall use its best efforts to obtain and
furnish promptly the information required to be included by it and
CCP II Acquisition, or such other information reasonably requested
by the Company or required by the applicable regulatory authorities
for inclusion, in the Proxy Statement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be obligated to use its best efforts or take any action pursuant to
this Section 2.12 if the Board of Directors has determined in good
faith after consultation with, and based as to legal matters upon,
the advice of its counsel that such actions would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under
applicable law.

<PAGE> 22
2.13 Exchange of Shares.

(a) Pursuant to an agreement (the "Disbursing Agent
Agreement") which shall provide for the matters set forth in
this Section 2.13 and otherwise on terms reasonably
satisfactory to CCP II and the Company and which shall be
entered into on or before the Effective Time between CCP II
Acquisition and a disbursing agent reasonably satisfactory to
the Company and CCP II Acquisition (the "Disbursing Agent"),
CCP II Acquisition shall deposit with the Disbursing Agent at
the Effective Time in trust for the benefit of the
shareholders of the Company and other Persons who have rights
to receive payments upon consummation of the Merger, pursuant
to Section 2.8 hereof, the Cash Merger Consideration (in
immediately available funds) to which holders of Shares, 1976
Series Preferred Shares, 1987 Series Preferred Shares, Options
and SARs shall be entitled pursuant to Section 2.8. The
Disbursing Agent shall invest portions of the cash deposited
with it in such manner as the Surviving Corporation directs,
provided that all of such investments be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America (collectively,
"Permitted Investments") or in money market funds which are
invested solely in Permitted Investments; provided, further,
that the maturities of Permitted Investments shall be such as
to permit the Disbursing Agent to make prompt payment of the
Cash Merger Consideration to shareholders of the Company and
other Persons who have rights to receive payments upon
consummation of the Merger pursuant to Section 2.8 hereof. 
Any interest or income produced by Permitted Investments shall
be payable to the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving
Corporation shall replace any monies lost through any
investment made at its direction pursuant to this Section
2.13(a). If outstanding certificates for Shares, 1976 Series
Preferred Shares or 1987 Series Preferred Shares are not
surrendered or the Cash Merger Consideration therefor set
forth in Section 2.8 hereof is not claimed prior to the two
hundred seventieth (270th) day after the Closing Date, the
unclaimed amounts shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation and persons entitled thereto may look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment thereof.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Disbursing Agent shall send a notice and form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected and risk of loss and title to the certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificate to the
Disbursing Agent) to each record holder of a certificate which
evidenced Shares, 1976 Series Preferred Shares or 1987 Series
Preferred Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than certificates representing Shares held as treasury
shares by the Company or held by any direct or indirect
majority-owned subsidiary of the Company and other than
Appraisal Shares) advising such holder of the effectiveness of
the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the
Disbursing Agent (who may appoint forwarding agents with the
approval of CCP II) such certificate or certificates for
exchange into the consideration set forth in Section 2.8. 
Each holder of a certificate theretofore evidencing Shares,
1976 Series Preferred Shares or 1987 Series Preferred Shares
converted into a right to receive the consideration set forth
in Section 2.8, upon surrender thereof to the Disbursing Agent
together with and in accordance with a duly executed letter of
transmittal, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the consideration set forth in Section 2.8 payable (as to the
Cash Merger Consideration, in the form of a check or, if so
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 23

requested by such holder, wire transfer) in respect of each
Share, 1976 Series Preferred Share or 1987 Series Preferred
Share theretofore evidenced by the certificate or certificates
so surrendered. Any payments due with respect to the
Contingent Payment Rights shall be made pursuant to Section
2.9 hereof and the Note Trust Agreement. Upon such surrender,
the Disbursing Agent will, as promptly as practicable pay the
Cash Merger Consideration. Until surrendered, each such
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced Shares, 1976 Series Preferred Shares or 1987 Series
Preferred Shares (other than certificates representing shares
held as treasury shares by the Company or held by any direct
or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the Company and other
than Appraisal Shares), shall be deemed for all purposes to
evidence only the right to receive the consideration set forth
in Section 2.8. In no event shall the holder of any such
surrendered certificate be entitled to receive interest on the
Cash Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.8.

(c) If the Cash Merger Consideration (or any portion
thereof) is to be delivered to a person other than the person
in whose name the certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to the
payment of the Cash Merger Consideration that the certificates
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be
proper and that the person requesting such transfer pay to the
Disbursing Agent any transfer or other taxes payable by reason
of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the
Disbursing Agent that such taxes have been paid or are not
required to be paid.

(d) Cash payments made pursuant to Section 2.8 for
Options and SARs shall be made by the Company at or prior to
the Effective Time.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company in place prior to the Effective
Time shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
transfers on such books (other than transfers by, to or for
the Company or CCP II) of the Shares, 1976 Series Preferred
Shares or 1987 Series Preferred Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Cash Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.8.

2.14 Closing. The Closing shall (unless the parties hereto
otherwise agree) take place on the Closing Date at the offices of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Chicago, Illinois at 10:00
a.m. or such other date and time as the Company and CCP II shall
mutually agree.<PAGE>

Insurance Subsidiary for each of the years ended December 31, 1991,
1992 and 1993.

Each such SAP Statement was timely filed with the insurance
regulatory authorities as required under applicable insurance laws,
rules and regulations. Each such SAP Statement complied in all
material respects with all applicable insurance laws, rules and
regulations when filed. Except as disclosed in Section 3.6 of the
Disclosure Schedule, each such SAP Statement, including without
limitation each balance sheet and each of the statements of
operations, changes in capital and surplus, and cash flows
contained in the respective SAP Statement, was prepared in
accordance with SAP and fairly presents in all material respects
the admitted assets, liabilities, and capital and surplus of each
Insurance Subsidiary as of the respective dates thereof and their
respective results of operations and cash flows for the respective
periods covered thereby.

stated in all material respects in accordance with sound actuarial
principles, are based on actuarial assumptions that are in
accordance in all material respects with those called for by the
provisions of the related insurance and annuity contracts and in
the related reinsurance, coinsurance and other similar contracts,
and meet the requirements in all material respects of the insurance
laws, rules and regulations of the respective states in which they
are domiciled. Adequate provision for all such reserves and
liabilities has been made in all material respects (under GAAS
consistently applied) to cover the total amount of all reasonably
anticipated matured and unmatured benefits, dividends, claims and
other liabilities of each Insurance Subsidiary under all insurance
and annuity contracts under which any Insurance Subsidiary has any
liability (including without limitation any liability arising under
or as a result of any reinsurance, coinsurance or other similar
Contract) on the respective dates of each such SAP Statement based
on then current information and assumptions regarding investment
income, mortality and morbidity experience, persistency and
expenses. Each Insurance Subsidiary owns assets that qualify as
legal reserve assets under applicable insurance laws, rules and
regulations of their respective state of domicile in an amount at
least equal to all such material reserves and liabilities.

of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents,
and none of the SEC Documents, as of its respective date, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The financial statements of
the Company included in the SEC Documents have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the

Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results

<PAGE> 47

6.4 Indemnification. (a) In the event of any threatened or
actual claim, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, in which any of the present or former
directors, officers or employees or the trustee and the
Administrative Committee of the ESOP (the "Indemnified Parties") of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, or is threatened to be,
made a party by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, whether before or after the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law (and shall also advance expenses incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided that the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification), each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation
shall pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation will use its best efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense of any such matter; provided that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); and provided further that the Surviving Corporation
shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 6.4(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) CCP II agrees that all rights to indemnification
(including with respect to the advancement of expenses) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the certificates of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms for a period of three years following
the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect to any claim ("Claim") asserted or made
within such period shall continue until disposition of such Claim.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 48

(c) CCP II will cause to be maintained for a period of not
less than three years from the Effective Time of the Merger each of
the Company's current directors' and officers' insurance and
indemnification policy (the "D&O Insurance") and Pension and
Welfare Fund and Fiduciary Responsibility insurance policy
("Fiduciary Insurance") to the extent that they provide coverage
for events occurring prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, so
long as the annual premium for each such policy would not be in
excess of 200% of its last annual premium for each such policy paid
prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum Premium"). CCP
II may, in lieu of maintaining such current policies as provided
above, cause comparable coverage to be provided under another
policy or policies so long as the material terms thereof are no
less advantageous than the existing D&O Insurance or Fiduciary
Insurance, as the case may be. If the existing D&O Insurance or
Fiduciary Insurance as the case may be expires, is terminated or
canceled during such three-year period, CCP II will use reasonable
efforts to cause to be obtained as much D&O Insurance or Fiduciary
Insurance, as the case may be, as can be obtained for the remainder
of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium for each such policy, on terms and conditions no
less advantageous than the existing D&O Insurance or Fiduciary
Insurance, as the case may be. The Company represents to CCP II
that the Maximum Premium for the D&O Insurance is $349,000 and the
Maximum Premium for the Fiduciary Insurance is $15,670.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each such Indemnified
Party and each such Indemnified Party's heirs and representatives.

6.5 Employment Continuation Agreements. (a) CCP II agrees
and acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger shall
constitute a "Change of Control of the Company" and the Effective
Time shall be deemed the "Change Date" under each of the Employment
Continuation Agreements set forth in the Filed SEC Documents and
agrees that following the consummation of the Merger, it shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, satisfy and discharge the
terms and provisions of the Employment Continuation Agreements,
including the obligations resulting from such a Change of Control
of the Company.

(b) The provisions of Section 6.5(a) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the officers and
employees party to such Employment Continuation Agreements and
their respective heirs and representatives.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 49
6.6 Guarantee of Performance. CCP II hereby guarantees (i)
the performance by CCP II Acquisition of its obligations under this
Agreement (ii) the obligations of the Surviving Corporation to make
the payments required by Article II hereof, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) the indemnification
obligations of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 6.4.

6.7 The ESOP. CCP II or CCP II Acquisition shall take such
steps as may be necessary (including amending the ESOP and its
related trust) to cause the Trustee of the ESOP and the
Administrative Committee to (i) use the aggregate consideration
received pursuant to Section 2.8 hereof with respect to shares of
the capital stock of the Company (as described in Section 3.3
hereof) that were held in the Loan Suspense Account (as such term
is defined in the ESOP) immediately prior to the Effective Time to
pay off the balance of the Acquisition Loan (as such term is
defined in the ESOP) and interest owing thereon; (ii) allocate any
excess of such aggregate consideration remaining after the
Acquisition Loan is paid off solely among all Participants'
accounts existing under the ESOP immediately prior to the Effective
Time on a pro rata basis in accordance with the provisions of the
ESOP regarding the allocation of trust earnings; and (iii) offer
each ESOP Participant the opportunity to receive the vested portion
of his account balances under the ESOP in a lump sum distribution
as soon as practicable after the later of (x) such Participant's
termination of employment following the Effective Time or (y) the
date the amounts described herein have been allocated; provided,
however, that the allocation described in (ii) above is contingent
upon the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS
providing that such allocation will not adversely affect the
qualified status of the ESOP, and provided, further, that if the
Surviving Corporation does not receive such a favorable
determination from the IRS, the Surviving Corporation, if the
Effective Time has occurred, shall take all such actions as may be
necessary and appropriate to provide for such allocation without
adversely affecting the qualified status of the ESOP, provided
further, that if after taking all such actions as may be necessary
and appropriate to provide for such allocation, the Surviving
Corporation is not able to obtain a favorable determination from
the IRS providing that such allocation will not adversely affect
the qualified status of the ESOP, the Surviving Corporation shall
take all such actions as may be necessary and appropriate to retain
the qualified status of the ESOP. The provisions of this Section
6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each ESOP Participant and each ESOP Participant's heirs and
assigns.<PAGE>

The Securities

SECTION 2.01. Form and Dating. The Securities and the
Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in
the form of Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated in and
expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities may have
notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock
exchange rule, agreements to which the Company is subject, if
any, or usage (provided that any such notation, legend or
endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company). Each
Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The
terms of the Securities set forth in Exhibit A are part of the
terms of this Indenture.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 26

SECTION 2.02. Execution and Authentication. Two
Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or
facsimile signature. The Company's seal shall be impressed,
affixed, imprinted or reproduced on the Securities and may be in
facsimile form.

If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no
longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates
the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.

A Security shall not be valid until an authorized
signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of
authentication on the Security. The signature shall be
conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated
under this Indenture.

The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities
for original issue in an aggregate principal amount of
$150,000,000, upon a written order of the Company signed by two
Officers or by an Officer and either an Assistant Treasurer or an
Assistant Secretary of the Company. Such order shall specify the
amount of the Securities to be authenticated and the date on
which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated. 
The aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding at any
time may not exceed that amount except as provided in
Section 2.07.

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the
Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an
authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the
Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to
authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such
agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any
Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and
demands.

SECTION 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company
shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be
presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the
"Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be
presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall
keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and
exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one
or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent"
includes any additional paying agent.

The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency
agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 27

party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the applicable
terms of the TIA and shall implement the provisions of this
Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify
the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the
Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the
Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate
compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or
co-registrar.

The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar
and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities.

SECTION 2.04. Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust. 
Not later than the close of business one Business Day prior to
each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the
Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to
pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The
Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee)
to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for
the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by
the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on
the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the
Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a
Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money
held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. 
The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all
money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds
disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section,
the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money
delivered to the Trustee.

SECTION 2.05. Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall
preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the
most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of
Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the
Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five
Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other
times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form
and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the
names and addresses of Securityholders.

SECTION 2.06. Transfer and Exchange. The Securities
shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only
upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. 
When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar
with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall
register the transfer as requested if the requirements of Section
8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities
are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request
to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of
other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as
requested if the same requirements are met. To permit
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 28

registration of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the
Registrar's or co-registrar's request. The Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or
other governmental charges in connection with any transfer or
exchange pursuant to this Section. The Company shall not be
required to make and the Registrar need not register transfers or
exchanges of Securities selected for redemption (except, in the
case of Securities to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof
not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days
before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or 15 days before
an interest payment date.

Prior to the due presentation for registration of
transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar may deem and treat the
person in whose name a Security is registered as the absolute
owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of
principal of and interest on such Security and for all other
purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security is overdue, and
none of the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar
or any co-registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange
pursuant to the terms of this Indenture will evidence the same
debt and will be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or
exchange.

SECTION 2.07. Replacement Securities. If a mutilated
Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a
Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or
wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall
authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of
Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the
Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the
Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder
shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the
Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss
which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The
Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses
in replacing a Security.

Every replacement Security is an additional obligation
of the Company.

SECTION 2.08. Outstanding Securities. Securities
outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the
Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it
for cancellation and those described in this Section as not
outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because
the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 29

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it
ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company
receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is
held by a bona fide purchaser.

If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in
accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity
date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable
on that date with respect to the Securities to be redeemed or
maturing, as the case may be, and the Paying Agent is not
prohibited from paying such money to the Securityholders on that
date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after
that date such Securities cease to be outstanding and interest on
them ceases to accrue.

SECTION 2.09. Temporary Securities. Until definitive
Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and
the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary
Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive
Securities but may have variations that the Company considers
appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable
delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall
authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange
for temporary Securities.

SECTION 2.10. Cancellation. The Company at any time
may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The
Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any
Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer,
exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel
and destroy (subject to the record retention requirements of the
Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of
transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver a
certificate of such destruction to the Company unless the Company
directs the Trustee to deliver canceled Securities to the
Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace
Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation.

SECTION 2.11. Defaulted Interest. If the Company
defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company
shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted
interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company
may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are
Securityholders on a subsequent special record date, which date
shall be at least five Business Days prior to the payment date. 
The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special
record date and payment date, and, at least 15 days before any
such special record date, the Company shall mail to each
Securityholder a notice that states the special record date, the
payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 30
ARTICLE 3.

Redemption

SECTION 3.01. Notices to Trustee. If the Company
elects to redeem Securities pursuant to paragraph 5 of the
Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
redemption date and the principal amount of Securities to be
redeemed.

The Company shall give each notice to the Trustee
provided for in this Section at least 60 days before the
redemption date unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period. 
Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel from the Company to the effect that such
redemption will comply with the conditions herein. If fewer than
all the Securities are to be redeemed, the record date relating
to such redemption shall be selected by the Company and given to
the Trustee, which record date shall be not less than 15 days
after the date of notice to the Trustee.

SECTION 3.02. Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed. 
If fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee
shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or
by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities
exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee in its sole
discretion considers fair and appropriate and in accordance with
methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in
similar circumstances. The Trustee shall make the selection from
outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption. The
Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of
Securities that have denominations larger than $1,000. 
Securities and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in
amounts of $1,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000. Provisions of
this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption
also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The
Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or
portions of Securities to be redeemed.

SECTION 3.03. Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days
but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of
Securities, the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed a notice
of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder of Securities to
be redeemed at such Holder's address as it appears in the records
of the Registrar.

The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed
and shall state:

(1) the redemption date;

(2) the redemption price;
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 31 
(3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

(4) that Securities called for redemption must be
surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the
redemption price;

(5) if fewer than all the outstanding Securities
are to be redeemed, the identification and principal
amounts of the particular Securities to be redeemed; 

(6) that, unless the Company defaults in making
such redemption payment, interest on Securities (or
portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue
on and after the redemption date and the only remaining
right of the Holder shall be to receive payment of the
redemption price upon presentation and surrender to the
Paying Agent of the Securities; 

(7) if any Security is being redeemed in part,
the portion of the principal amount of such Security to
be redeemed and that, after the redemption date, upon
presentation and surrender of such Security, a new
Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued; and

(8) that no representation is made as to the
correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any,
listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.

At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the
notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's
expense. In such event, the Company shall provide the Trustee
with the information required by this Section.

SECTION 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once
notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption
become due and payable on the redemption date and at the
redemption price stated in the notice. Upon presentation and
surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at
the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest
to the redemption date. Failure to give notice or any defect in
the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the
notice to any other Holder.

SECTION 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price. Not later
than the close of business one Business Day prior to the
redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent
(or, if the Company or a Subsidiary acts as the Paying Agent,
shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the
redemption price of and accrued interest on all Securities to be
redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions thereof
called for redemption which have been delivered by the Company to
the Trustee for cancellation.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 32

SECTION 3.06. Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon
surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for and deliver
to the Holder (at the Company's expense) a new Security equal in
principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security
surrendered.

Company may not incur any Indebtedness: (i) which is subordinated
or junior in ranking or right of payment in respect to any Senior
Indebtedness unless such Indebtedness is Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness or is expressly subordinated in right of payment to
Senior Subordinated Indebtedness; (ii) which is Subordinated

or settlement of any claim or litigation, (vi) Indebtedness (or
Indebtedness incurred to refinance such Indebtedness) pursuant to
any interest rate or currency swaps, floors, caps or collars to

regarding the Offer, including but not limited to information
with respect to historical income, cash flow and capitalization
after giving pro forma effect to such Asset Sale to the extent
practicable. The notice shall specify that unless the Company
shall default in the payment of the Asset Sale Purchase Price,
after the Purchase Date interest thereon will cease to accrue
with respect to any Securities accepted for purchase by the
Company, and shall contain all instructions and materials
necessary to tender Securities pursuant to the Offer, together
with the information contained in clause (3) below.

(2) Not later than the date upon which written notice
of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided above, the
Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as
to (i) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), (ii) the
allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Sale pursuant
to which the Offer is being made and (iii) the compliance of such
allocation with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section. 
On or before such date, the Company shall also irrevocably
deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as
its own paying agent, segregate and hold in trust) in immediately
available funds an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held
for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. 
Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains
open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the
Trustee the Securities or portions thereof which have been
properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The
Paying Agent shall, on or promptly after the Purchase Date, mail
or deliver payment to each tendering Holder in the amount of the
Asset Sale Purchase Price with respect to the Securities tendered
by such Holder and accepted by the Company from the funds
provided by the Company for such payment. In the event that the
aggregate Asset Sale Purchase Price of all Securities delivered
by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount, the
Paying Agent shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately
after the expiration of the Offer Period.

(3) Holders electing to have Securities purchased will
be required to surrender the Securities to the Company at the
address specified in the notice at least three Business Days
prior to the Purchase Date. A Holder will be entitled to
withdraw its election if the Trustee or the Company receives not
later than three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth
the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Securities
which were delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement
that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such
Securities purchased. If at the expiration of the Offer Period
the aggregate principal amount of Securities surrendered by
Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Company shall select the
Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis (with such
adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that
only Securities in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples
thereof shall be purchased first). Holders whose Securities are
purchased only in part will be issued new Securities of the same
series equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of
the Securities surrendered.

(4) At the time the Company delivers Securities to the
Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company will
also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such
Securities are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Section and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that the terms of this Indenture have been
complied with. Securities shall be deemed to have been accepted
for purchase at the time the Paying Agent mails or delivers
payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.

(5) The Company shall comply with any tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act which may then be applicable,
including Rule 14e-1, or other applicable laws or regulations in
connection with any Offer required to be made by the Company to
repurchase the Securities pursuant to this Section. In the event
of any conflict between such tender offer rules or other
applicable laws or regulations and the provisions of this
Section, such rules or other laws or regulations shall control. 
The Company may assign its obligation to repurchase the
Securities as a result of an Asset Sale to a third party (which
may or may not be an Affiliate), so long as the Company remains
an obligor of the Securities not repurchased and agrees to
repurchase the Securities on the Purchase Date to the extent such
third party fails to do so. Any such offer by a third party must
comply with any applicable tender offer rules or other applicable
laws or regulations.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 43

SECTION 4.09. Change of Control. (a) In the event of
a Change of Control, the Company will be required to repurchase
all or any part of each Holder's Securities tendered pursuant to
a tender offer by the Company for the Securities (a "Repurchase
Offer") at a purchase price in cash (the "Repurchase Price")
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such purchase in accordance with
the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section.

(b) (1) Within 30 days following any Change of
Control, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by
first-class mail, to each Holder, a written notice stating that a
Change of Control has occurred and that the Holder may elect to
have such Holder's Securities repurchased by the Company either
in whole or in part in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal
amount, at the Repurchase Price. The notice shall specify a
purchase date (the "Repurchase Date") not less than 30 days nor
more than 60 days after the date of such notice (or such longer
period as may be reasonably necessary for the Company to comply
with any applicable laws and regulations), and shall contain
information concerning the circumstances and relevant facts
regarding such Change of Control which the Company in good faith
believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision
regarding the Repurchase Offer, including but not limited to
information with respect to historical income, cash flow and
capitalization after giving pro forma effect to the Change of
Control to the extent practicable. The notice shall specify that
unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Repurchase
Price, after the Repurchase Date interest thereon will cease to
accrue with respect to any Securities timely tendered, and shall
contain all instructions and materials necessary to tender
Securities pursuant to the Repurchase Offer, together with the
information contained in clause (3) below.

(2) Not later than the Repurchase Date, the Company
shall irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the
Company is acting as its own paying agent, segregate and hold in
trust) in immediately available funds an amount equal to the
total amount necessary to repurchase all the Securities (the
"Repurchase Amount") to be held for payment in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. Upon the expiration of the
period for which the Repurchase Offer remains open (the
"Repurchase Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee
the Securities or portions thereof which have been properly
tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Paying
Agent shall, on or promptly after the Repurchase Date, mail or
deliver payment to each tendering Holder in the amount of the
Repurchase Price with respect to the Securities tendered by such
Holder and accepted by the Company from the funds provided by the
Company for such payment. In the event that the aggregate
Repurchase Price of all Securities delivered by the Company to
the Trustee is less than the Repurchase Amount, the Paying Agent
shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the
expiration of the Repurchase Period.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 44

(3) Holders electing to have Securities repurchased
will be required to surrender the Securities to the Company at
the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days
prior to the Repurchase Date. A Holder will be entitled to
withdraw its election if the Trustee or the Company receives not
later than three Business Days prior to the Repurchase Date, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth
the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Securities
which were delivered for repurchase by the Holder and a statement
that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such
Securities repurchased. Holders whose Securities are repurchased
only in part will be issued new Securities of the same series
equal in principal amount to the non-repurchased portion of the
Securities surrendered.

(4) At the time the Company delivers Securities to the
Trustee which are to be accepted for repurchase, the Company will
also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such
Securities are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Section and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that the terms of the Indenture have been
complied with. Securities shall be deemed to have been accepted
for repurchase at the time the Trustee receives such delivery and
Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel from the Company.

(5) The Company shall comply with any tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act which may then be applicable,
including Rule 14e-1, or other applicable laws or regulations in
connection with any offer required to be made by the Company to
repurchase the Securities pursuant to this Section. In the event
of any conflict between such tender offer rules or other
applicable laws or regulations and the provisions of this
Section, such rules or other laws or regulations shall control. 
The Company may assign its obligation to repurchase the
Securities as a result of a Change of Control to a third party
(which may or may not be an Affiliate), so long as the Company
remains an obligor of the Securities not repurchased and agrees
to repurchase the Securities on the Repurchase Date to the extent
such third party fails to do so. Any such offer by a third party
also must comply with any applicable tender offer rules or other
applicable laws or regulations.

SECTION 4.10. Limitation on Liens Securing
Subordinated or Pari Passu Indebtedness. If the Company or any
Subsidiary creates, incurs, assumes or suffers to exist any Lien
of any kind (i) securing any Subordinated Indebtedness of the
Company or Indebtedness of the Company which ranks Pari Passu
with the Securities, then the Company will or will cause its
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 45

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, concurrently or immediately
thereafter, to provide that the Securities are equally and
ratably secured; provided, however, that in the case of
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Lien securing such Subordinated
Indebtedness shall be subordinate and junior to the Lien securing
the Securities with the same relative priority as such
Subordinated Indebtedness shall have with respect to the
Securities; provided further, however, that this Section 4.10
shall not apply to the Lien encumbering the Redemption Fund; or
(ii) securing any assumption, guarantee or other liability of any
Subsidiary in respect of any Subordinated Indebtedness of the
Company or Indebtedness of the Company which ranks Pari Passu
with the Securities, then a substantially similar assumption,
guarantee or other liability of such Subsidiary in respect of the
Securities, concurrently or immediately thereafter, shall be
equally and ratably secured; provided, however, that in the case
of Subordinated Indebtedness, the Lien securing the assumption,
guarantee or other liability of any Subsidiary in respect of such
Subordinated Indebtedness shall be subordinate and junior to the
Lien securing the assumption, guarantee or other liability of
such Subsidiary in respect of the Securities with the same
relative priority as such Subordinated Indebtedness shall have
with respect to the Securities.

SECTION 4.11. Business Activities. The Company will
not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, engage in any
business other than (i) the insurance and reinsurance business
and such business activities incidental or related thereto, 
(ii) such other businesses as the Company or its Subsidiaries are
engaged in on the date of this Indenture and (iii) businesses
which are conducted through Subsidiaries other than those
referred to in (i) or (ii) above as long as the aggregate
Investments of the Company and its Subsidiaries in such
Subsidiaries do not exceed 5% of the total Invested Assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.12. Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees by
Subsidiaries. (a) The Company will not permit any Subsidiary,
directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness of the
Company which is Pari Passu with or subordinate in right of
payment to the Securities ("Guaranteed Indebtedness"), unless
(i) such Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a
supplemental indenture to this Indenture providing for a
Guarantee (a "Subsidiary Guarantee") of payment of the Securities
by such Subsidiary and (ii) such Subsidiary waives, and will not
in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage
of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any
other rights against the Company or any other Subsidiary as a
result of any payment by such Subsidiary under its Subsidiary
Guarantee. If the Guaranteed Indebtedness is (A) Pari Passu with
the Securities, then the Guarantee of such Guaranteed
Indebtedness shall be Pari Passu with, or subordinated to, the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 46

Subsidiary Guarantee or (B) subordinated to the Securities, then
the Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be
subordinated to the Subsidiary Guarantee at least to the extent
that the Guaranteed Indebtedness is subordinated to the
Securities.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 4.12(a), any
Subsidiary Guarantee by a Subsidiary shall provide by its terms
that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon (i) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person
not an Affiliate of the Company, of all of the Company's and each
Subsidiary's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the
assets of, such Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is
not prohibited by this Indenture) or (ii) the release or
discharge of the Guarantee which resulted in the creation of such
Subsidiary Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a
result of payment under such Guarantee.

SECTION 4.13. Compliance Certificate. The Company
shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year, an Officers' Certificate stating that a review
of the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the
preceding fiscal year has been made under the supervision of the
signing officers with a view to determining whether each has
kept, observed, performed and fulfilled its obligations under
this Indenture, and further stating as to each such officer
signing such Officers' Certificate, that to the best of his or
her knowledge each has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled
each and every covenant contained in this Indenture and is not in
default in the performance or observance of any terms, provisions
and conditions hereof (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default
of which he or she may have knowledge and what action each is
taking or proposes to take with respect thereto). The Company
also shall comply with TIA Section 314(a)(4) in the event that it
imposes any requirement which is not satisfied by compliance by
the Company with the requirements of the preceding sentence.

SECTION 4.14. Further Instruments and Acts. Upon
request of the Trustee, the Company will execute and deliver such
further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably
necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of
this Indenture.

successor Person to which such sale, assignment, conveyance,
transfer, lease or disposition is made shall succeed to, and be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such
successor had been named as the Company herein; and thereafter,

respective properties which is not covered by insurance

effect (each, a "Bankruptcy Law") or appointing a
custodian, rehabilitator, conservator, supervisor,
trustee, sequestrator or other similar official (any of
the foregoing, a "Custodian") of the Company or any
Material Subsidiary for any substantial part of its or

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 50

(8) the commencement by the Company or any

by the Company or any Material Subsidiary to the filing
of such petition or the appointment of or taking

Material Subsidiary or of any substantial part of its
property, or the making by it of an assignment for the
benefit of creditors, or the admission by the Company
or any Material Subsidiary in writing of its inability
to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the
taking of corporate action by the Company or any
Material Subsidiary in furtherance of any such action.

The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30
days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of
an Officers' Certificate of any event which is or with the giving
of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default,
its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to
take with respect thereto.

SECTION 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default
(other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or
(8)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the
Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
the Securities by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may
declare the principal of and accrued interest on all the
Securities to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If
an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) occurs,
the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall ipso
facto become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Securityholders. 

At any time after such declaration of acceleration has
been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of money
due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter provided, the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities, by
written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if:
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 51

(a) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee
a sum sufficient to pay

(1) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee
hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel,

(2) all overdue interest on all Securities,

(3) the principal of (and premium, if any, on)
any Securities which have become due otherwise than by
such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon
at the rate borne by the Securities, and

(4) to the extent that payment of such interest
is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate
borne by the Securities; and

(b) all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment
of principal of the Securities which has become due solely by
such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or
waived. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default
or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available
remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the
Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the
Securities or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does
not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them
in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any
Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an
Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. 
No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available
remedies are cumulative.

SECTION 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the
Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except
(i) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a
Security or (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that under
Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each
Securityholder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed
cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
Default or impair any consequent right.

SECTION 6.05. Control by Majority. The Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 52

remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse
to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture
or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is
unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or
would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided,
however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper
by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. 
Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be
entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or
not taking such action. This Section 6.05 shall be in lieu of
Section 316(a)(I)(A) of the TIA and such Section 316(a)(I)(A) is
hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by
the TIA.

SECTION 6.06. Limitation on Suits. A Securityholder
may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the
Securities unless:

(1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written
notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the Securities make a written request to the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee
reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability
or expense;

(4) the Trustee does not comply with the request
within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of
security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Securities do not give the Trustee a direction
inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.

A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to
prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a
preference or priority over another Securityholder.

SECTION 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right
of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on
the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective
due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective
dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of
such Holder.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 53

SECTION 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event
of Default in payment of interest or principal specified in
Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may
recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal and
interest remaining unpaid (together with interest on such unpaid
interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in
Section 7.07.

SECTION 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The
Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any
judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or
its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable
regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of
a trustee in bankruptcy or other person performing similar
functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is
hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee
and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of
such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any
amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its
counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 7.07.

SECTION 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any
money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out
the money or property in the following order:

FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under
Section 7.07;

SECOND: to holders of Senior Indebtedness to the
extent required by Article 10;

THIRD: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid
on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without
preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due
and payable on the Securities for principal and interest,
respectively; and

FOURTH: to the Company.

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for
any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section. At
least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to
each Securityholder and the Trustee a notice that states the
record date, the payment date and amount to be paid.

SECTION 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for
the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in
any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 54

it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing
by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the
costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess
reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against
any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits
and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party

of more than 10% in principal amount of the Securities.

SECTION 6.12. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The
Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall not at any
time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law
wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which
may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture;
and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby
expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and
shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power
herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the
execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.

Trustee

SECTION 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall
exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a

the conduct of such person's own affairs.

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of

(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the
Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the
statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the
Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the
certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they
conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 55

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error
of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it

Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur
financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if
it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability
is not reasonably assured to it.

(h) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the
conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to
the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section
and to the provisions of the TIA.

SECTION 7.02. Rights of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may

on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not
investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

to herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or
Company Order. Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting,

be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent
appointed with due care.

advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters

to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good

counsel.

(f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this
Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the
Holders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless
such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred therein or thereby.

SECTION 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The
Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the
owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the
Company or its affiliates with the same rights it would have if
it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar
or co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However,
the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

SECTION 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs
and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee

pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of such
Security), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as
a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that
withholding the notice is in the interests of Securityholders.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 57

SECTION 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. As
promptly as practicable after each May 15 beginning with the
May 15 following the date of this Indenture, and in any event
prior to July 15 in each year, the Trustee shall mail to each
Securityholder a brief report dated as of May 15 that complies
with TIA Section 313(a), if an event has occurred requiring a report
under such section. The Trustee also shall comply with TIA
Section 313(b).

A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to
Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock
exchange (if any) on which the Securities are listed. The
Company agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the
Securities become listed on any stock exchange and of any
delisting thereof.

SECTION 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company
shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable
compensation for its services. The Trustee's compensation shall
not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an
express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon
request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or
made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the
compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the
reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances
of the Trustee's agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The
Company shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all loss,
liability or expense (including attorneys' fees) incurred by it
in connection with the administration of this trust and the
performance of its duties hereunder, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in
connection therewith. The Trustee shall notify the Company
promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure
by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend
the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the
Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The
Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any
loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the
Trustee's own wilful misconduct, negligence or bad faith.

To secure the Company's payment obligations in this
Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on
all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than
money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest
on particular Securities.

The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this
Section shall survive the discharge of this Indenture. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 58

When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence
of a Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to
the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of
administration under the Bankruptcy Law.

SECTION 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may
resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the
Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor
Trustee. The Company shall remove the Trustee if:

(1) the Trustee fails to comply with
Section 7.10;

(2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or
insolvent;

(3) a receiver or other public officer takes
charge of the Trustee or its property; or

(4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of
acting.

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy
exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in
such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the
Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance
of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. 
Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee
shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all
the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this
Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its
succession to Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall
promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the
successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in
Section 7.07.

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60
days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the
retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Trustee.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any
Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor
Trustee.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 59

Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant
to this Section, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07
shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

SECTION 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger. If the
Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers
all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets
to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting,
surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall
be the successor Trustee; provided, that such successor Trustee
shall qualify and be eligible under Section 7.10 hereof.

In case at the time such successor or successors by
merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed
to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities
shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such
successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of
authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such
Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the
Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to
the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name
of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to
the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have
the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this
Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall
have. 

SECTION 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. The
Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA
Section 310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus
of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published
annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA
Section 310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from
the operation of TIA Section 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures
under which other securities or certificates of interest or
participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding
if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in
TIA Seciton 310(b)(1) are met.

SECTION 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims
Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a),
excluding from the operation thereof any creditor relationship
listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been
removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated.

ARTICLE 8.

Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance

SECTION 8.01. Discharge of Liability on
Securities; Defeasance. (a) When (i) the Company delivers to
the Trustee all outstanding Securities (other than Securities
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 60

replaced pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (ii) all
outstanding Securities have become due and payable and the
Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds sufficient to
pay at maturity all outstanding Securities, including interest
thereon (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section
2.07), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums
payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall,
subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.06, cease to be of further
effect. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge
of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost
and expense of the Company.

(b) Subject to Sections 8.01(c), 8.02 and 8.06, the
Company at any time may terminate (i) all its obligations under
the Securities and this Indenture ("legal defeasance option") or
(ii) its obligations under Sections 4.03 through 4.12,
5.01(iii) and 5.01(iv) and the operation of Sections 6.01(3)
(with respect to Sections 4.03 through 4.12, 5.01(iii) and
5.01(iv)), 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(6), 6.01(7) (with respect to
any Material Subsidiary) and 6.01(8) (with respect to any
Material Subsidiary) ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company
may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.

If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option,
payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant
defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in
Section 6.01(3) (with respect to Sections 4.03 through 4.12, 
5.01(iii) and 5.01(iv)), 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(6), 6.01(7) (with
respect to any Material Subsidiary) or 6.01(8) (with respect to
any Material Subsidiary).

Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein
and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in
writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company
terminates.

(c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the
Company's obligations in Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07,
7.07, 7.08, 8.04, 8.05 and 8.06 shall survive until the
Securities have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's
obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 shall survive.

SECTION 8.02. Conditions to Defeasance. The Company
may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant
defeasance option only if:

(1) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust
with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for
the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to
maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 61

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a
certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent
accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of
principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on
the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited
money without investment will provide cash at such times and
in such amounts (but, in the case of the legal defeasance
option only, not more than such amounts) as will be
sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the
Securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(3) 123 days pass after the deposit is made and
during the 123-day period no Default specified in
Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs
which is continuing at the end of the period;

(4) no Default has occurred and is continuing on
the date of such deposit and after giving effect thereto;

(5) the deposit does not constitute a default
under any other agreement binding on the Company and is not
prohibited by Article 10;

(6) the Company delivers to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting
from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a
regulated investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940; 

(7) in the case of the legal defeasance option,
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from,
or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service
a ruling, or (ii) since the date of this Indenture there has
been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in
either case to the effect that, and based thereon such
Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Securityholders
will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income
tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be
subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such defeasance had not occurred;

(8) in the case of the covenant defeasance
option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securityholders
will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income
tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and
will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; and 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 62

(9) the Company delivers to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and
discharge of the Securities as contemplated by this
Article 8 have been complied with.

arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of
Securities at a future date in accordance with Article 3.

SECTION 8.03. Application of Trust Money. The Trustee
shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations
deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8. It shall apply the
deposited money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations
through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to
the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities.

the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon
request any excess money or securities held by them at any time.

Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the

request any money held by them for the payment of principal or
interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter,
Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company
for payment as general creditors.

SECTION 8.05. Indemnity for Government Obligations. 
The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any
tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against
deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and
interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations.

SECTION 8.06. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying
Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations
in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal
proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under
this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated
as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8
until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to
apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance
with this Article 8; provided, however, that, if the Company has
made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities
because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company
shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such
Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S.
Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

observed.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 64

An amendment under this Section may not make any change
that adversely affects the rights under Article 10 of any holder
of Senior Indebtedness then outstanding unless the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness (required pursuant to the terms of such
Senior Indebtedness to give such consent) consent to such change.

After an amendment under this Section (other than the
amendment contemplated by Section 9.01(9)) becomes effective, the
Company shall mail to Securityholders a notice briefly describing
such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all
Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or
affect the validity of an amendment under this Section. 

SECTION 9.02. With Consent of Holders. The Company
and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities
without notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent
of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Securities. However, without the consent of each Securityholder
affected, an amendment may not:

(1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders
must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for
payment of interest on any Security;

(6) make any change in Article 10 that adversely
affects the rights of any Securityholder under Article 10;
or

(7) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 or
the second sentence of this Section.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the
Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent
approves the substance thereof.

An amendment under this Section may not make any change
that adversely affects the rights under Article 10 of any holder
of Senior Indebtedness then outstanding unless the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness (required pursuant to the terms of such
Senior Indebtedness to give such consent) consent to such change.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 65

After an amendment under this Section becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders a notice
briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such
notice to all Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not
impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section.

SECTION 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. 
Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the
Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.

SECTION 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents and
Waivers. A consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder of a
Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of
that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same
debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the
consent or waiver is not made on the Security. However, any such
Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as
to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the
Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the
amendment or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment or
waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder.

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a
record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders
entitled to give their consent or take any other action described
above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this
Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the
immediately preceding paragraph, those persons who were
Securityholders at such record date (or their duly designated
proxies), and only those persons, shall be entitled to give such
consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any
such action, whether or not such persons continue to be Holders
after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or
effective for more than 120 days after such record date.

SECTION 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. 
If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may
require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. 
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security
regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. 
Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the
Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee
shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed
terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a
new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.

SECTION 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments. The Trustee
shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if
the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the
Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment the
Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01)
shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment
is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. Each amendment
pursuant to this Article 9 shall be in the form of a supplemental
indenture.

SECTION 9.07. Payment for Consent. Neither the
Company, any Affiliate of the Company nor any Subsidiary shall,
directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any
consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to
any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or
the Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid or
agreed to be paid to all Holders which so consent, waive or agree
to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents
relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable

payment or distribution or by the Holders or the Trustee if
received by them or it, directly to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the
respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders)
or their Representatives, as their respective interests appear,
to the extent necessary to pay all such Senior Indebtedness in
full, in cash or cash equivalents, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for
the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 10.03. Default on Senior Indebtedness. No
direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of the Company of Note
Obligations, whether pursuant to the terms of the Securities or
upon acceleration or otherwise, shall be made if, at the time of
such payment, there exists a default in the payment of all or any
portion of any Senior Indebtedness or any other default on Senior
Indebtedness occurs and the maturity of such Senior Indebtedness
is accelerated in accordance with its terms, unless, in either
case, such default shall have been cured or waived or the
benefits of this sentence waived by or on behalf of the holders
of such Senior Indebtedness or such Senior Indebtedness shall
have been repaid in full in cash or cash equivalents. In
addition, during the continuance of any other event of default
with respect to (i) the Credit Agreement pursuant to which the
maturity thereof may be accelerated, upon receipt by the Trustee
of written notice from the Bank Agent, no payment of Note
Obligations may be made by or on behalf of the Company for a
period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the date of
receipt of such notice and ending 179 days thereafter (unless (x)
such Payment Blockage Period shall be terminated by written
notice to the Trustee from the Bank Agent, (y) such event of
default has been cured or waived or (z) such Senior Indebtedness
shall have been repaid in full in cash or cash equivalents) or
(ii) any other Designated Senior Indebtedness pursuant to which
the maturity thereof may be accelerated, upon receipt by the
Trustee of written notice from the Representative for the holders
of such other Designated Senior Indebtedness (or the holders of
at least a majority in principal amount of such other Designated
Senior Indebtedness then outstanding), no payment of Note
Obligations may be made by or on behalf of the Company for a
Payment Blockage Period commencing on the date of receipt of such
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 68

notice and ending 179 days thereafter (unless (x) such Payment
Blockage Period shall be terminated by written notice to the
Trustee from such Representative, or such holders, (y) such event
of default has been cured or waived or (z) such Designated Senior
Indebtedness shall have been repaid in full in cash or cash
equivalents). Not more than one Payment Blockage Period may be
commenced with respect to the Securities during any period of 360
consecutive days; provided that, subject to the limitations set
forth in the next sentence, the commencement of a Payment
Blockage Period by the Representative for, or the holders of,
Designated Senior Indebtedness, other than under the Credit
Agreement, shall not bar the commencement of another Payment
Blockage Period by the Bank Agent within such period of 360
consecutive days. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to
the contrary, there must be 181 consecutive days in any 360-day
period in which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. No
event of default that was, or that reasonably should have been,
known to exist or be continuing on the date of commencement of
any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior
Indebtedness initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or
shall be made, the basis for the commencement of a second Payment
Blockage Period by the Representative for, or the holders of,
such Designated Senior Indebtedness, whether or not within a
period of 360 consecutive days, unless such event of default
shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90
consecutive days. 

SECTION 10.04. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over. 
If a distribution is made to Securityholders that because of this
Article 10 should not have been made to them, the Securityholders
who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders
of Senior Indebtedness and pay it over to them as their interests
may appear.

SECTION 10.05. Subrogation. After all Senior
Indebtedness is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in
full, Securityholders shall be subrogated to the rights of
holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions
applicable to Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under
this Article 10 to holders of Senior Indebtedness which otherwise
would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between the
Company and Securityholders, a payment by the Company on Senior
Indebtedness.

SECTION 10.06. Relative Rights. This Article 10
defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of
Senior Indebtedness. Nothing in this Indenture shall:

(1) impair, as between the Company and
Securityholders, the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on the Securities in accordance with their
terms; or
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 69

(2) prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder
from exercising its available remedies upon a Default,
subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to
receive distributions otherwise payable to Securityholders.

SECTION 10.07. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by
Company. No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to
enforce the subordination of the indebtedness evidenced by the
Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the
Company or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.

SECTION 10.08. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent. 
Notwithstanding Section 10.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent may
continue to make payments on the Securities and shall not be
charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would
prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than
two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust
Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that
payments may not be made under this Article 10. The Company, the
Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative for
the holders of Senior Indebtedness or a holder of Senior
Indebtedness may give the notice; provided, however, that, if an
issue of Senior Indebtedness has a Representative, only such
Representative may give the notice.

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may
hold Senior Indebtedness with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying
Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be
entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 10 with
respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held
by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior
Indebtedness; and nothing in Article 7 shall deprive the Trustee
of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 10
shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or
pursuant to Section 7.07.

SECTION 10.09. Distribution or Notice to
Representative. Whenever a distribution is to be made or a
notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness, the distribution
may be made and the notice given to their Representative (if
any).

SECTION 10.10. Article 10 Not To Prevent Events of
Default or Limit Right To Accelerate. The failure to make a
payment pursuant to the Securities by reason of any provision in
this Article 10 shall not be construed as preventing the
occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article 10 shall have
any effect on the right of the Securityholders or the Trustee to
accelerate the maturity of the Securities.

SECTION 10.11. Trust Moneys Not Subordinated.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government
Obligations held in trust under Article 8 by the Trustee for the
payment of principal of and interest on the Securities shall not
be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness
or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article 10, and
none of the Securityholders shall be obligated to pay over any
such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness
of the Company or any other creditor of the Company.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 70

SECTION 10.12. Trustee Entitled To Rely. Upon any
payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee
and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely (i) upon any
order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any
proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10.02 are
pending, (ii) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or
agent or other person making such payment or distribution to the
Trustee or to the Securityholders or (iii) upon the
Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness for the
purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in
such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount
thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or
distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to
this Article 10. In the event that the Trustee determines, in
good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right
of any person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate
in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the
Trustee may request such person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior
Indebtedness held by such person, the extent to which such person
is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and
other facts pertinent to the rights of such person under this
Article 10, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee
may defer any payment to such person pending judicial
determination as to the right of such person to receive such
payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall be
applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee
pursuant to this Article 10.

SECTION 10.13. Trustee To Effectuate Subordination. 
Each Securityholder by accepting a Security authorizes and
directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the
subordination between the Securityholders and the holders of
Senior Indebtedness as provided in this Article 10 and appoints
the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

SECTION 10.14. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of
Senior Indebtedness. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any
fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall
not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over
or distribute to Securityholders or the Company or any other
person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior
Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10 or
otherwise.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 71

SECTION 10.15. Reliance by Holders of Senior
Indebtedness on Subordination Provisions. Each Securityholder by
accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing
subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an
inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior
Indebtedness, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or
acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to
acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior
Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be
deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination
provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing
to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 10.16. Proof of Claims. In the event that the
Company is subject to any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law and
the Securityholders and the Trustee fail to file any proof of
claim permitted to be filed in such proceeding with respect to
the Securities, then any Representative of any Senior
Indebtedness may file such proof of claim no earlier than the
later of (i) the expiration of 15 days after such Representative
notifies the Trustee of its intention to do so and (ii) 30 days
preceding the last day permitted to file such claim.

of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent,
Securities owned by the Company or by any person directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or
indirect common control with the Company shall be disregarded and
deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which the

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 74

SECTION 11.09. Governing Law. This Indenture and the

to its assets, (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding
up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether
or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment
for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets
and liabilities of Company, then each Securityholder agrees that
<PAGE>

it shall not be entitled to any payment or distribution of any
kind or character of assets of the Redemption Fund, whether in
cash, property or securities, by set-off or otherwise. The

[FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF SECURITY]

11-1/4% Senior Subordinated Note Due 2004

1. Interest

[Issuer], a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and
its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter
referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay
interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per
annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on 
March 15 and September 15 of each year. Interest on the
Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which
interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from
September 29, 1994. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay
interest on overdue principal at the rate borne by the Securities
plus 1% per annum, and it shall pay interest on overdue
installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful.

2. Method of Payment

The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except
defaulted interest) to the persons who are registered holders of
Securities at the close of business on the March 1 or September 1
next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are
canceled after the record date and on or before the interest
payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying
Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay
principal and interest in money of the United States that at the
time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private
debts. However, the Company may pay principal and interest by
check payable in such money. It may mail an interest check to a
Holder's registered address.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar

Initially, LTCB Trust Company, a New York corporation
("Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company
may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-
registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically
incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent,
Registrar or co-registrar.

4. Indenture

The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture
dated as of September 29, 1994 ("Indenture"), between the Company
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 78

and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those
stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by
reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Section 77aaa-
77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). 
Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the
meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are
subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to
the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.

The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the
Company limited to $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount
(subject to Section 2.07 of the Indenture). The Indenture
imposes certain limitations on the issuance of debt by the
Company, the issuance of debt and preferred stock by the
Subsidiaries, the payment of dividends and other distributions
and acquisitions or retirements of the Company's Capital Stock
and Subordinated Indebtedness, the sale or transfer of assets and
Subsidiary stock and transactions with Affiliates. In addition,
the Indenture limits the ability of the Company and the
Subsidiaries to restrict distributions and dividends from
Subsidiaries. Each of the foregoing limitations is subject to a
number of important qualifications and exceptions.

5. Optional Redemption

The Securities may not be redeemed prior to September
15, 1999. On and after that date, the Company may redeem the
Securities in whole at any time or in part from time to time at
the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of
principal amount), plus accrued interest to the redemption date:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

Period Percentage
------ ----------
<S> <C>
From September 15, 1999 through September 14, 2000 105.625%

From September 15, 2000 through September 14, 2001 102.813%

From September 15, 2001 and thereafter 100.000%
</TABLE>

6. Notice of Redemption

Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days
but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each
Holder of Securities to be redeemed at his registered address. 
Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in
part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient
to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all
Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption
date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the
redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on
and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Securities
(or such portions thereof) called for redemption.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 79

7. Put Provisions 

Upon a Change of Control, any Holder of Securities will
have the right to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part
of the Securities of such Holder at a repurchase price equal to
101% of the principal amount of the Securities to be repurchased
plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase as provided in,
and subject to the terms of, the Indenture.

8. Subordination

The Securities are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness,
as defined in the Indenture. To the extent provided in the
Indenture, Senior Indebtedness must be paid before the Securities
may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Securityholder by
accepting a Security agrees, to the subordination provisions
contained in the Indenture and authorizes the Trustee to give it
effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such
purpose.

9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange

The Securities are in registered form without coupons
in denominations of $1,000 and whole multiples of $1,000. A
Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the
Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other
things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents
and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the
Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or
exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the
case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the
Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of
15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or
15 days before an interest payment date.

10. Persons Deemed Owners

The registered holder of this Security may be treated
as the owner of it for all purposes.

11. Unclaimed Money

If money for the payment of principal or interest
remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent
shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an
abandoned property law designates another person. After any such
payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the
Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 80

12. Defeasance

Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time
may terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities
and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money
or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and
interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case
may be.

13. Amendment, Waiver

Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the
Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended
with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount outstanding of the Securities and (ii) any
default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with
the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount outstanding of the Securities. Subject to certain
exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any
Securityholder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the
Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect or inconsistency, or to comply with Article 5 of the
Indenture, or to provide for uncertificated Securities in
addition to or in place of certificated Securities, or to comply
with the Act or to add additional covenants or surrender Company
rights, or to make certain changes in the subordination
provisions, or to make any change that does not adversely affect
the rights of any Securityholder.

14. Defaults and Remedies

Under the Indenture, Events of Default include
(i) default in payment of principal on the Securities at
maturity, upon redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of the
Securities, upon declaration or otherwise, or failure by the
Company to redeem or purchase Securities when required;
(ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the
Securities; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with other
agreements in the Indenture or the Securities, subject to notice
and lapse of time; (iv) certain accelerations (including failure
to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary if the amount
accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $10 million, and the
commencement of foreclosure proceedings by certain holders of
secured Indebtedness; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or
insolvency with respect to the Company or any Material
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 81

Subsidiary; and (vi) certain judgments or decrees for the payment
of money in excess of $10 million. If an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the Securities may declare all the Securities
to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy
or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the
Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence
of such Events of Default. Securityholders may not enforce the
Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. 
The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities
unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to
certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any
trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders
notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of
principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice
is in their interest.

15. Trustee Dealings with the Company

Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the
Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may
otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the
Company or its affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company
or its affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were
not Trustee.

16. No Recourse Against Others

A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such,
of the Company or the Trustee shall not have any liability for
any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the
Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason
of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security,
each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of
the Securities.

17. Waiver Regarding Redemption Fund

By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and
releases any and all rights and claims it may have as a creditor
