NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 1994
(unaudited)

1. Basis of presentation

The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information
and footnote disclosures, normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
SEC rules and regulations; nevertheless, management believes that
the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading. These consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's
1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC in March 1994. 
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the Company as of March 31,
1994, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
consolidated cash flows for the periods shown in the interim
consolidated financial statements, have been included herein. 
The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the full years.

2. Investments

In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
(Statement 115), which was implemented by the Company effective
January 1, 1994. The Company has classified substantially all of
its investment portfolio as "available-for-sale." In accordance
with Statement 115, investments classified as "available-for-
sale" are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains or losses
are reported on a separate caption in stockholders' equity. 
Implementation of Statement 115 has had no material impact on the
Company's financial statements, since unrealized gains and losses
at March 31, 1994 were not material.

3. Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of the purchase
price of acquired subsidiaries over the net tangible assets
acquired and represent the long-term earning capacity of the
businesses acquired. Intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 30 years.

<PAGE>
4. Long-term debt

The Company established a credit facility in May 1992, which was
amended in August 1993, and which consists of a term loan, the
outstanding balance of which was $31.5 million at March 31, 1994,
and a reducing revolving line of credit, the outstanding balance
of which was $6.0 million at March 31, 1994, each terminating
June 30, 1997. The credit facility is secured by substantially
all assets of the Company. There is an unused balance of $34.0
million available under the line of credit at March 31, 1994. 
Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a floating
rate that is based primarily on the principal lender's prime rate
in the London interbank market.

The term loan requires prepayments in addition to quarterly
installments if assets or subsidiaries are sold, or if debt or
capital stock is issued. Prepayments are also required if there
is cash flow in excess of certain defined amounts. The credit
facility is subject to covenants that include maintaining certain
financial ratios, various restrictions regarding sales of assets,
liens, guarantees, dividends, etc. and limitations regarding
investments, annual lease obligations and annual capital
expenditures.

5. Acquisition

The Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Comprecare,
Inc. (Comprecare) on September 9, 1993. The acquisition was
treated as a purchase for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements include the operations of
Comprecare, which consists primarily of an HMO, beginning
September 9, 1993. The purchase price was approximately $49.5
million in cash, 1,817,000 shares of the Company's common stock,
and options to purchase approximately 151,000 shares of the
Company's common stock for $3.70 per share. The Company financed
the cash portion of the purchase price, as well as its repayment
of Comprecare's outstanding long-term debt, the balance of which
was $15.5 million, through borrowings under its credit facility
(see Note 3).

The following table summarizes the pro forma consolidated results
of operations of the Company as though the acquisition of
Comprecare had occurred on January 1, 1993. The pro forma
consolidated results of operations shown below do not necessarily
represent what the consolidated results of operations of the
Company would have been if the acquisition of Comprecare had
actually occurred on January 1, 1993, nor do they represent a
forecast of the consolidated results of operations of the Company
for any future period.

6. Merger

On March 3, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement and plan
of merger with FHP International Corporation (FHP) under which
FHP agreed to acquire all the outstanding common stock of the
Company. FHP agreed to exchange 1.6 shares of its convertible
preferred stock, $28 in cash, and between .41379 and .48000
shares of its common stock, depending upon the average closing
price of FHP's common stock near the effective date of the
merger, for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock. 
The merger is contingent upon customary closing conditions,
including approval by the stockholders of both the Company and
FHP (at stockholder meetings scheduled to occur on June 10,
1994), regulatory approvals, and FHP obtaining financing.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors
TakeCare, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
TakeCare, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of TakeCare, Inc. at December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

TAKECARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1993

1. Summary of significant accounting policies

Organization

TakeCare, Inc. (the Company) owns and operates several
health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other related
businesses. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly-owned. All significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated. See Note 7 for a description of significant
acquisitions by the Company during 1992 and 1993.

Cash equivalents and short-term investments

Cash equivalents consist of marketable securities with
maturity dates less than three months after the date of purchase. 
Short-term investments consist of marketable securities with
maturity dates less than one year after the date of purchase. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments are stated at cost
which approximates market. In the opinion of management, there
is no significant concentration of credit risk in these
marketable securities as of December 31, 1993.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of the
purchase price of acquired subsidiaries over the net tangible
assets acquired and represent the long-term earning capacity of
the businesses acquired. Intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 30 years. Intangible assets are
assessed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there has
been an impairment thereof.

Furniture and equipment

Furniture and equipment is recorded at cost, and depreciated
on a straight-line basis over five to ten years, except for
certain computer software, which is depreciated on an accelerated
basis over five years.

Claims payable and incurred but not reported claims

The liability for claims payable and incurred but not
reported claims is estimated using the most recent data available
for claims incurred prior to but not yet paid as of the balance
sheet date. The accrued shared-risk pool incentive liability is
based in part on the estimate of incurred but not reported
claims.

Revenue recognition

Premium revenue is recognized during the applicable month of
coverage. Deferred premium revenue represents cash received from
employer groups in advance of the applicable period of coverage. 
In the opinion of management, there is no significant
concentration of credit risk in the premiums receivable from
employer groups.

Major customers

One employer group accounted for 11% of the Company's
premium revenue during 1993. There were no employer groups that
accounted for 10% or more of the Company's premium revenue during
1992 or 1991.

Health care expenses

The Company's HMO subsidiaries provide incentives for the
participating medical groups and physicians to control health
care expenses through the use of various risk-sharing
arrangements. Incentive payments are made to medical groups and
physicians based on their performance in controlling health care
costs. Expenses related to these risk-sharing arrangements are
recorded in the period in which the related health care expenses
are incurred.

The Company's HMO subsidiaries purchase reinsurance to cover
hospital expenses in excess of a specified annual amount per member. 
Reinsurance premiums are reported as health care expenses and
related reinsurance recoveries are reported as reductions in
health care expenses.

Pension plan

The Company has a Savings and Retirement Plan (the 401(k)
Plan) available to employees. Eligible employees can make
elective contributions to a trust, provided the annual
contribution to each employee's account does not exceed the
maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. During 1993, 1992
and 1991 the Company made $837,000, $557,000 and $111,000 of
matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan, which is included in
marketing and administrative expense. 

Earnings per share

Earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding during the period. The number of
common shares outstanding in 1991 has been adjusted for the stock
split described in Note 6. Common stock equivalents consist of
stock options granted to key executives and participating medical
groups (see Note 5).

Fair value of financial instruments

In the opinion of management, the balances of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, premiums receivable, long-
term investments, and long-term debt all approximate their
respective fair values.

Unrealized gains and losses

In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (Statement
115), which establishes a new method of accounting for unrealized
gains and losses on investments. The Company has not yet
implemented Statement 115, but is required to do so effective
January 1, 1994. Implementation of Statement 115 is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements,
since unrealized gains and losses on investments have not been
material.

2. Long-term debt

Long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):

The credit facility consists of a term loan, the outstanding
balance of which was $44.0 million at December 31, 1993, and a
reducing revolving line of credit, the outstanding balance of
which was $6.0 million at December 31, 1993, each terminating
June 30, 1997. The credit facility is secured by substantially
all assets of the Company. There is an unused balance of $34.0
million available under the line of credit at December 31, 1993. 
Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a floating
rate that is based primarily on the principal lender's prime rate
in the London interbank market. The weighted average interest
rate on the outstanding balance of the term loan at December 31,
1993 was 4.9%.

The term loan requires prepayments in addition to quarterly
installments if assets or subsidiaries are sold, or if debt or
capital stock is issued. Prepayments are also required if there
is cash flow in excess of certain defined amounts. The credit
facility is subject to covenants that include maintaining certain
financial ratios, various restrictions regarding sales of assets,
liens, guarantees, dividends, etc. and limitations regarding
investments, annual lease obligations and annual capital
expenditures. 

<PAGE>
3. Income taxes

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes (Statement 109)" was implemented
effective January 1, 1993, which changed the Company's method of
accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the
liability method. Implementation of Statement 109 resulted in no
material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary
differences in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses
for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Significant
components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities
as of December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):

Deferred tax assets:
Health care expenses . . . . . . . $ 18,928
Bad debt expense . . . . . . . . . 1,107

The Company has received a notice of proposed adjustment
from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its tax returns
for 1988 through 1991. In the opinion of management, any such
adjustment will not have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.

4. Commitments and contingencies

Professional liability

The Company has professional liability insurance for
potential claims incurred in connection with its operations,
which covers claims made during the policy period. The Company
intends to keep the current insurance policy in force during the
foreseeable future. In the opinion of management, there are no
professional liability claims outstanding which, individually or
in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial statements.

Operating leases

The Company is obligated for office and equipment rental
under the terms of various operating leases. Operating lease
expense was $4,063,000, $3,231,000, and $802,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991. At December 31, 1993,
minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases were
as follows (in thousands):

1994 . . . . . . . . . . $ 4,305
1995 . . . . . . . . . . 3,928

_______
Total. . . . . . . $15,324

Subsequent to December 31, 1993, the Company entered into an
operating lease agreement for office space under which it became
obligated for minimum aggregate rental payments of $9,529,000
during the period from 1994 to 1998, in excess of the commitments
shown above.

Litigation

The Company is involved in various legal actions in the
normal course of business. In the opinion of management, such
legal actions will not have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.

5. Stockholders' equity

Stock options

The Company granted options to purchase shares of
outstanding common stock of its subsidiary, TakeCare Health Plan,
Inc. (THP), to key executives and certain participating medical
groups (PMGs) during the period from 1988 to 1991. Activity in
such stock options during 1991 was as follows:

All of the stock options outstanding at December 31, 1993
become exercisable either at the rate of 25% within two years
after the date of grant and an additional 25% each year there-
after, or at the rate of 20% within three years after the date of

Outstanding options at December 31, 1993 expire at the
earlier of the date the option holder ceases to be an employee,
director or PMG, as the case may be, or eight to ten years after
the date of grant, based on the date of grant of the original
options in the case of the Replacement Options and the Comprecare
Options. Options to purchase 227,973 shares at a weighted
average exercise price of $6.21 per share were exercisable at
December 31, 1993. All outstanding options granted by the
Company have an exercise price that is equal to the fair market
value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. 
Outstanding Comprecare Options have an exercise price that is
equal to the fair market value of the common stock of Comprecare,
Inc. on the date of grant of the original options. 

The Company adopted the 1990 Stock Option Plan (the 1990
Plan) effective February 15, 1991. Under the 1990 Plan, 600,000
shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance upon
exercise of options to be granted thereunder. Options to
purchase 387,000 shares, of which options to purchase 352,000
shares are outstanding at December 31, 1993, have been granted
under the 1990 Plan as of December 31, 1993. The Company adopted
the 1993 Stock Option Plan (the 1993 Plan) effective May 3, 1993. 
Under the 1993 Plan, 151,487 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance upon exercise of options to be granted
thereunder. Options to purchase 151,487 shares, of which options
to purchase 146,077 shares are outstanding at December 31, 1993,
have been granted under the 1993 Plan at December 31, 1993. 

Restricted Assets

All of the Company's HMO subsidiaries and certain of its
other subsidiaries are subject to state regulatory requirements
to maintain a minimum amount of capital surplus or tangible net
equity, and in certain states, restricted deposits. Such
regulatory requirements, together with certain other contractual
requirements, restricted the Company's ability to transfer an
aggregate of approximately $47.5 million of net assets from the
Company's subsidiaries to the Company at December 31, 1993.

6. Recapitalization

An amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation
was filed on March 4, 1991 to (i) increase the authorized common
stock to 20,000,000 shares; (ii) create a new class of preferred
stock consisting of 1,000,000 authorized shares; (iii) effect a
stock split of 1,415 shares of common stock for each share then
outstanding; and (iv) effect certain other amendments to the
certificate. All share and per share amounts in these consoli-
dated financial statements have been restated to give retroactive
effect to the recapitalization and the 1,415-for-1 stock split. 

7. Acquisitions

The Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Lincoln
National Administrative Services Corporation (LNASC) on May 8,
1992 and all of the outstanding stock of two corporations that
were affiliates of LNASC during May and June 1992. The acquisi-
tions of the LNASC stock, effective April 30, 1992, and of the
related stock are treated as purchases for accounting purposes. 
The consolidated financial statements include the operations of
LNASC and its affiliates, which consist primarily of HMOs,
beginning April 30, 1992. The purchase price was approximately
$145 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments,
including an addition to the purchase price of between $3 million
and $7.4 million, and was financed through a private placement of
500,000 shares of common stock in which the Company received $10
million, a long-term $105 million credit facility with a group of
banks, which was paid in full in 1993, and internally generated
funds. 

In connection with this acquisition, the Company retained
HMOs operating in California, Colorado, Illinois, and Ohio and
intended, within one year of the acquisition, to divest itself of
nine smaller HMOs that were also acquired (the Disposition HMOs). 
Eight of the Disposition HMOs were sold during 1992, and the
remaining Disposition HMO was sold on June 30, 1993. 

As of the acquisition date, the Company established a
reserve of $4.5 million for the estimated operating losses of the
Disposition HMOs prior to their disposition by the Company, and
for the estimated net gain or loss on the sale of the Disposition
HMOs, which was added to intangible assets and a corresponding
accrued liability. During the period from April 30, 1992 to
December 31, 1993 the operating losses incurred by the Disposi-
tion HMOs, net of operating gains, were $4.3 million, the gain on
the sale of the Disposition HMOs, net of losses, was $5.8
million, and the reserve was reduced by $6.0 million, which
resulted in a corresponding reduction in intangible assets during
1993. As a result, there is no remaining reserve at December 31,
1993. 

As of the acquisition date, the Company recorded intangible
assets of $118.0 million, which included estimated acquisition
costs and the $4.5 million reserve for estimated losses on the
operation and sale of the Disposition HMOs. During the period
from April 30, 1992 to December 31, 1993, intangible assets were
reduced by $6.6 million due to a gain on the retirement of
outstanding preferred stock of one of the Disposition HMOs,
reduced by $6.0 million due to a reduction in the reserve for
estimated losses on the operation and sale of the Disposition
HMOs, reduced by $3.7 million due to post-closing adjustments to
the purchase price, and increased by $2.8 million due to actual
acquisition costs that exceeded the original estimate. As a
result, intangible assets resulting from the acquisition, before
accumulated amortization, were $104.5 million at December 31,
1993.

The Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Comprecare, Inc. (Comprecare) on September 9, 1993. The
acquisition is treated as a purchase for accounting purposes. 
The consolidated financial statements include the operations of
Comprecare, which consist primarily of an HMO in Colorado,
beginning September 9, 1993. The purchase price was approxi-
mately $49.5 million in cash, 1,817,000 shares of the Company's
common stock, and options to purchase approximately 151,000
shares of the Company's common stock for $3.70 per share. The
cash portion of the purchase price, and the repayment of
Comprecare's outstanding long-term debt of $15.5 million, was
financed through borrowings under a credit facility with a group
of banks (see Note 2). 

As of the acquisition date, the Company recorded intangible
assets of $103.9 million, which included estimated acquisition
costs. During the four months ended December 31, 1993, intan-
gible assets were increased by $0.6 million due to additional
acquisition costs. As a result, intangible assets resulting from
the acquisition, before accumulated amortization, were $104.5
million at December 31, 1993. 

The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma
consolidated results of operations of the Company as though the
acquisitions of LNASC and its affiliates and Comprecare had
occurred on January 1, 1992. The unaudited pro forma consoli-
dated results of operations shown below do not necessarily
represent what the consolidated results of operations of the
Company would have been if the acquisitions had actually occurred
on January 1, 1992, nor do they represent a forecast of the
consolidated results of operations of the Company for any future
period.

8. Subsequent event

On March 3, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement and
plan of merger with FHP International Corporation (FHP) under
which FHP agreed to acquire all the outstanding common stock of
the Company. FHP agreed to exchange 1.6 shares of its convert-
ible preferred stock, $28 in cash, and approximately .45 shares
of its common stock, subject to adjustment, for each outstanding
share of the Company's common stock. In the event that the
average closing market price of FHP's common stock near the close
of the transaction is between $25.00 and $29.00, the terms of the
FHP preferred stock will be adjusted so that each 1.6 shares of
it will have an estimated market value of $40.00, and the number
of shares of FHP common stock will be adjusted so that the common
stock provided will have a market value of $12.00, providing for
an aggregate value of $80 per share of the Company's common
stock. In the event that the average closing market price of FHP
common stock near the close of the transaction is more than $29
or less than $25, the aggregate value of the consideration will
be more or less than $80 per share of the Company's common stock. 
The merger is contingent upon customary closing conditions,
including approval by the stockholders of both the Company and
FHP, regulatory approvals, and FHP obtaining financing.

9. Litigation - (unaudited)

In 1993, an action was brought against LNASC and Lincoln
National Health Plan (LNHP) alleging numerous complaints. On July 20,
1994, after a six-day jury trial, the jury returned a verdict finding
LNASC and LNHP liable for approximately $26,800,000 which includes
$25,000,000 of punitive damages. On August 3, 1994, the defendants
filed a motion for judgments notwithstanding the verdict, new trial
and in the alternative, remittitur of the punitive damages award. 
The Court has tentatively set September 14, 1994 as the date for the
hearing on the post-trial motions. The management of the Company
believes that its liability, if any, would be all or partially covered by
insurance claims and contract claims. The Company will vigorously 
contest the verdict and believes the eventual outcome will
not have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the
Company.

FHP INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA UNAUDITED
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

1. General

The historical and pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet of FHP International Corporation ("FHP" or "the
Company") reflects the Merger as though it occurred on March 31, 1994. 
The historical and pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of income of the Company reflect the Merger and the
September 1993 acquisition of Comprecare, Inc. by TakeCare, Inc.
("TakeCare") as though both transactions occurred on July 1, 1992. 
The Merger will be accounted for as a purchase transaction.

No effect has been given in the historical and pro forma
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for operating
and synergistic benefits that may be realized through the combination
of the entities, including any increased enrollment of Medicare
eligible persons in geographic areas principally served by TakeCare
(Northern California, Colorado, Illinois, and Ohio). Certain minor
reclassifications have been made to the TakeCare historical financial
statements to conform them to FHP's presentation.

TakeCare has agreed with FHP that if the expenses of TakeCare
incurred in connection with the Merger, including financial advisory
fees, accounting, legal and consulting fees, and costs in connection
with any litigation relating to the Merger, exceed $3 million, such
excess (the "Excess Expenses") will reduce pro rata the amount of cash
or shares of Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock to be
issued in the Merger upon conversion of each share of TakeCare Common
Stock. For purposes of these pro forma financial statements, the
Excess Expenses are assumed to be $8.0 million, resulting in a
reduction of the cash consideration to $27.38 from $28.00 or of the
Series B Preferred Stock from 1.12 shares to approximately 1.10 shares
for each share of TakeCare Common Stock.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share
of TakeCare common stock (estimated to be 12,912 shares for purposes
of these historical and pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements (pro forma financial statements)) will be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, the following
consideration (valued at an aggregate of $80.00 per share less the
estimated impact of the Excess Expenses of approximately $0.62 per
share for purposes of these pro forma financial statements):

(1) 1.6 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock (Series A Preferred Stock); plus

(2) 1.12 shares of Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock (Series B Preferred Stock), or at the specific election of the
holder, cash of $28.00 per share of TakeCare Common Stock; plus

(3) .48 of a share of FHP Common Stock, as provided in the
Merger Agreement since FHP's stock traded at less than an average of
$25 per share for 20 consecutive trading days ending on the third
trading day prior to the effective date of the Merger.

Holders of Series A Preferred Stock with stated value of $25 will
be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends of 5.0% per annum. 
Dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears when and if declared by
FHP's Board of Directors. On or after the fourth anniversary of the
Merger, FHP may, at its option, redeem all or part of the outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at fixed redemption prices per
share plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible at the option of
the holder into FHP Common Stock at any time commencing six months
after the Closing. The conversion price for the Series A Preferred
Stock is $31.00 per share.

Holders of Series B Preferred Stock with stated value of $25 will
be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends of not less than 5.0%
per annum or greater than 11.0% per annum. The actual dividend rate
will be determined quarterly based upon prevailing market rates as
provided in the Merger Agreement. Dividends will be payable quarterly
in arrears when and if declared by FHP's Board of Directors. 
Beginning nine months after June 17, 1994, FHP may, at its option,
redeem all or part of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, at $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid
dividends.

2. Cash and Cash Equivalents

Pro forma adjustments to cash and cash equivalents consist of the
following:

Proceeds of long-term borrowings
(net of financing costs of $1,600) $310,490

Cash consideration paid in the Merger (353,531)

Repayment of TakeCare long-term
obligations, including current portion (37,500)

Payment of estimated costs of the Merger (11,459)

Payment of Excess Expenses of
TakeCare (see Note 1) (8,000)
_________

($100,000)
=========

The pro forma financial statements assume that the holders of
TakeCare Common Stock will elect to receive cash of $27.38 per share
as Merger Consideration in lieu of the Series B Preferred Stock. (See
Note 9 for summary pro forma financial information assuming holders of
TakeCare Common Stock elect to receive approximately 1.10 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock as Merger Consideration.)

The TakeCare long-term obligations are being retired immediately
after the Closing as required by TakeCare's existing debt agreement
upon a change in control of TakeCare.

3. Excess of Purchase Price Over Net Assets Acquired

Pro forma adjustments to the excess of purchase price over net
assets acquired consist of the following:

Resulting from the Merger $1,015,185
Elimination of previously recorded excess 
of purchase price over net assets acquired 
of TakeCare (net of accumulated amortization 
of $13,726) (223,047)
___________
$792,138
===========

Management has not completed an allocation of the purchase price
of TakeCare to the assets and liabilities that will be acquired. 
However, management believes that the amounts reflected on TakeCare's
historical consolidated balance sheet as tangible assets and
liabilities approximate the fair market values of such assets and
liabilities and accordingly, such assets have not been adjusted in the
accompanying pro forma financial statements.

4. Long-term Obligations 

Pro forma adjustments to long-term obligations consist of the
following:

Borrowings to finance the Merger $50,000 $262,090 $312,090

____________ __________ ___________ _________ 

($1,309) $12,422 ($241) $10,206 
============ ========== =========== =========

The interest rate on the long-term obligations incurred to
finance the Merger is a floating rate based on the principal lender's
prime rate in the London Interbank market plus 0.6% which, based upon
current rates, would be approximately 5.1%. Each 1/4% increase in
such floating rate would decrease annual pro forma consolidated net
income by $398 and pro forma consolidated earnings per share
attributable to Common Stock by $0.01 per annum.

9. Earnings Per Share 

Earnings per share is based on the weighted average shares of
outstanding Common Stock and common stock equivalents during the
respective periods. The pro forma financial statements assume the
holders of TakeCare common stock will elect to receive cash in lieu of 
Series B Preferred Stock issued as of the effective date. The
inclusion of additional common shares assuming the conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive for the year
ended June 30, 1993 and the nine months ended March 31, 1994 for both
the primary and fully diluted pro forma earnings per share
computations. Accounting rules governing the computation of earnings
per share require that dividends on cumulative preferred stock,
whether declared or not, be deducted in the earnings per share
computation.

The shares used in the computation of primary earnings per share
were as follows:

Cash dividends on Series A

Merger (dividend at 5%) $25,824 $19,368
======= =======

The pro forma financial statements have been prepared assuming
that all Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding for the year ended
June 30, 1993 and the nine months ended March 31, 1994.

As stated above, the pro forma financial statements assume the
holders of TakeCare Common Stock will elect to receive cash in lieu of
the Series B Preferred Stock. Accordingly, earnings per share has
been calculated assuming that no shares of Series B Preferred Stock
will be issued. If all holders of TakeCare Common Stock were to elect
to receive Series B Preferred Stock rather than cash, the principal
changes to the historical and pro forma unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of income would be as follows, assuming an
interest rate equal to 93% of the thirty-year average yield published
by the Federal Reserve Board as provided for in the Merger Agreement
(approximately 6.9% for this pro forma calculation - see Note 1 for
further explanation of range of possible dividends):
