ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
- ---------------------------------------------

On March 1, 1994, KeyCorp, a financial services holding company headquartered
in Albany, New York, ("Old KeyCorp") and Society Corporation ("Society"), a
financial services holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, completed
the merger of Old KeyCorp into and with Society, which assumed the name
KeyCorp. The merger was completed under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of October 1, 1993, as amended. The terms of the merger are
more fully described in the Society and Old KeyCorp Prospectus/Joint Proxy
Statement for the Special Meetings of Shareholders held February 16, 1994,
included in Society's Form S-4 Registration Statement No. 33-51717 filed
December 28, 1993. Shareholders of Society and Old KeyCorp approved the merger
in separate meetings on February 16, 1994. Federal Reserve Board approvals
were granted and other necessary regulatory approvals were received prior to
March 1, 1994.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, 124,351,183 shares of KeyCorp common
stock were exchanged for all of the outstanding shares of Old KeyCorp common 
stock (based on an exchange ratio of 1.205 shares for each share of Old 
KeyCorp). The outstanding preferred stock of Old KeyCorp was exchanged on a 
one-for-one basis for 1,280,000 shares of a comparable, new issue of 10% 
Cumulative Preferred Stock of KeyCorp.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of
December 31, 1993, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements 
of income for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, give effect 
to the merger based on the historical consolidated financial statements of 
Society and Old KeyCorp under the assumptions and adjustments set forth in the 
accompanying notes to the pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

The pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared by the
managements of Society and Old KeyCorp based upon their respective consolidated
financial statements, which include results of operations as if the merger had
been consummated on January 1, 1991. The pro forma condensed combined
financial statements may not be indicative of the results that actually would
have occurred if the merger had been in effect during the period presented or
which may be obtained in the future. As a part of the ongoing merger
integration process, management is evaluating the accounting policies and
practices of the combined organization. This evaluation may result in certain
conforming accounting adjustments, the effects of which are not expected to be
material to the financial condition or results of operations of the combined
organization. The pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and
the related accompanying notes thereto of Old KeyCorp, included herein, and
those of Society.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) Pro forma adjustments to common shares and capital surplus, at December 31,
1993, reflect the combination of Old KeyCorp and Society, accounted for as a
pooling of interests, through: (a) the exchange of 124,351,183 shares of
KeyCorp Common Shares for all outstanding shares of Old KeyCorp common stock at
an Exchange Ratio of 1.205 shares of KeyCorp Common Shares for each share of
Old KeyCorp common stock, and (b) the exchange of 1,280,000 shares of KeyCorp
Preferred Stock for all outstanding shares of Old KeyCorp Preferred Stock on a
share-for-share basis. Under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"),
the assets and liabilities of Society have been combined with those of Old
KeyCorp at book values. In addition, the statements of income of Society have
been combined with the statements of income of Old KeyCorp on a retroactive
basis. 

(2) Pro forma weighted average Common Shares for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992, and 1991, reflect the issuance of 1.205 KeyCorp Common Shares for
each share of Old KeyCorp Common Stock.

(3) During 1993, Society and Old KeyCorp recorded combined restructuring
charges of $118.7 million ($80.6 million after tax, $.33 per Common Share) in
connection with the merger Old KeyCorp with and into Society. These
restructuring charges include accruals for merger expenses, consisting primarily
of investment banking and other professional fees directly related to the
merger ($20.5 million); severance payments and other employee costs ($49.6
million); systems and facilities costs ($35.7 million); and other costs
incident to the merger ($12.9 million). These charges were recorded by the
respective parent companies in the fourth quarter of 1993 at which time
management determined that it was probable that a liability for such charges
had been incurred and could be reasonably estimated.

Although no assurance can be given, it is also expected that, as a result of
the merger, cost savings will be achieved by the combined institution at an
annual rate of approximately $100 million by the end of the first quarter of
1995. These cost savings are anticipated to result from the integration of
operations and from efficiencies in certain combined lines of business.
Management presently expects that approximately 50% of the annual cost savings
will be achieved in 1994. The pro forma condensed combined financial
statements do not give effect to the anticipated cost savings in connection
with the merger from the consolidation of operations and improved efficiencies
of Society and KeyCorp.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG / INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Shareholders and Board of Directors
KeyCorp

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KeyCorp and 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated 
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of KeyCorp and 
subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of 
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries 
(the "Corporation") are prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and prevailing practices within the financial services
industry. The following is a summary of significant accounting and reporting
policies.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KeyCorp 
(the "Parent") and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and 
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts 
have been reclassified to conform to current year classifications. Assets held 
in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the consolidated 
financial statements.

As discussed in Note 3, Mergers and Acquisitions, the financial statements give
retroactive effect to the merger of Puget Sound Bancorp with and into the 
Corporation, accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly, all 
financial data are presented as if both companies had been merged for all 
periods presented.

Business Combinations

In business combinations accounted for as pooling of interests, the assets, 
liabilities and shareholders' equity of the respective companies are carried 
forward at their historical amounts, the companies' results of operations are
combined and the prior period financial statements are restated to give effect
to the merger, unless the effect of the business combination is not material to
the financial statements of the Corporation.

In business combinations accounted for as purchases, the results of operations
of the acquired businesses are included from the respective dates of 
acquisition. Net assets of the companies acquired are recorded at their cost to
the Corporation at the date of acquisition.

Statement of Cash Flows

Cash and due from banks are the only items considered as cash and cash 
equivalents.

Investment Securities

Investment securities are those securities which the Corporation has the 
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Investment securities are 
carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of 
discounts on a level yield basis. Gains or losses from the sale of investment 
securities are recognized upon realization and are computed on the specific 
identification method.

Securities Available for Sale

Securities available for sale are carried at the lower of their aggregate cost 
or market value. Gains or losses from the sale of securities available for sale
are computed using the specific identification method and are included in net 
securities gains.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115).
SFAS 115 requires that equity securities having readily determinable fair
values and all investments in debt securities be classified and accounted for 
in three categories. Debt securities that management has the positive intent 
and ability to hold to maturity are to be classified as "held-to-maturity 
securities" and reported at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities that 
are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near 
term are to be classified as "trading securities" and reported at fair value, 
with unrealized gains and losses included in operating results. Debt and equity
securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading 
securities are to be classified as "available for sale securities" and 
reported at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from 
operating results and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Adoption of SFAS 115 is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 
1993, with earlier application permitted. The Corporation will adopt SFAS 115 
in 1994. Based upon the Corporation's securities portfolio at December 31, 
1993, the estimated impact of adopting SFAS 115 would be an increase to 
shareholders' equity of $15.9 million, with no effect on the results of 
operations.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, market value, 
or contracted sales value when fixed price commitments to sell exist.

Loans

Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income,
including deferred loan fees and costs. Interest on loans and amortization of 
unearned income is credited to income, on a level yield basis.

The accrual of interest is discontinued when circumstances indicate that 
collection is questionable, or generally when payment is over 90 days past 
due. In such cases, interest accrued but not collected is charged against the 
Allowance for Loan Losses. Thereafter, payments received are first applied to 
the principal. Depending on management's assessment of the ultimate 
collectibility of the loan, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis.
Loans are returned to accrual status when management determines that the 
circumstances have improved to the extent that both principal and interest are
deemed collectible and there is a sustained period of repayment performance.
<PAGE> 6
Nonrefundable loan origination and commitment fees and the direct costs 
associated with originating or acquiring loans are deferred. The net deferred 
amount is amortized as an adjustment to the related loan yield over the 
contractual life of the related loans.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The Allowance for Loan Losses (the "Allowance") is intended to absorb future 
probable losses in the loan portfolio. Additions to the Allowance are made by 
charges to the Provision for Loan Losses. These additions are based upon 
several factors, including management's continual review of the overall quality
of the loan portfolio (with special attention to those loans which are not 
current as to principal and/or interest), and the growth and composition of the
loan portfolio (including the collateral).

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" (SFAS 114), effective for 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. SFAS 114 prescribes valuation
methodology for impaired loans. Such loans must be valued using the present 
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest 
rate, the loans observable market price or the fair value of the loans 
underlying collateral. The Corporation expects to adopt SFAS 114 prospectively 
starting in the first quarter of 1995. It is anticipated that the adoption of 
SFAS 114 will not have a material effect on the Corporation's financial 
condition or results of operations.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation. Capital leases are included in premises and 
equipment at the capitalized amount less accumulated amortization. Depreciation
and amortization included in operating expenses are computed principally on the
straight-line method throughout the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
Additions to premises and equipment and major replacements or improvements are
capitalized.

Other Assets

Included in other assets are real estate and repossessed personal property held
for sale which have been acquired principally through foreclosure or a similar 
conveyance of title. Real estate may be considered to be in-substance 
foreclosed and included in other assets prior to the conveyance of title when
specific criteria are met. Both foreclosed and in-substance foreclosed real 
estate, as well as repossessed personal property, are carried at the lower of
their recorded amounts or fair value less estimated costs of disposal. Any
write-downs at, or prior to, the dates of acquisition are charged to the 
Allowance for Loan Losses. Subsequent write-downs are recorded in noninterest
expense. Expenses incurred in connection with holding such assets, and gains 
and losses upon sale, are included in other noninterest expense.

Intangible assets are principally comprised of core deposit intangibles and the
excess of cost over net assets of acquired subsidiaries (goodwill). Core 
deposit intangibles represent the present value of the difference in costs 
between the acquired core deposits and the market alternative funding sources
and are amortized on an accelerated basis over lives ranging from 7 to 14 
years.

The excess of cost over net assets of acquired subsidiaries is amortized on a 
straight-line basis over periods generally not exceeding 25 years. In 
acquisitions of financially-troubled institutions the excess cost, if any, is
amortized over the average weighted life of the acquired long-term interest-
bearing assets, which has ranged from 5 to 10 years.

Purchased mortgage servicing rights represent the cost of the right to receive
future servicing income. Purchased mortgage servicing rights are amortized 
(as a reduction to service fee income) over the estimated life of the related 
loans in proportion to the recognition of estimated net servicing income. An 
evaluation of the carrying amount of the purchased mortgage servicing rights 
is performed on a disaggregated basis by discounting the expected future cash 
flows, taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based upon 
current industry expectations.

Other Postemployment Benefits

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits" (SFAS 112), generally
effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 1993. SFAS 112 
establishes standards for accounting and reporting the cost of benefits 
provided by an employer to its former or inactive employees after employment 
but before retirement. The Corporation provides certain benefits to former and 
inactive employees. The current accounting by the Corporation with respect to 
these benefits does not materially differ from the requirements of SFAS 112. 
The Corporation adopted SFAS 112 on a prospective basis on January 1, 1994.

Income Taxes

The Corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" 
(SFAS 109).
<PAGE> 7
The Corporation, with the exception of Key Bank Life Insurance Ltd., files a 
consolidated federal income tax return.

Interest Rate Swaps

As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, KeyCorp enters into 
interest rate swap agreements. Revenue and expense associated with interest
rate swaps entered into as part of KeyCorp's asset and liability management 
activities is recognized as an adjustment to interest income and expense.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income, less preferred 
stock dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.

NOTE 2. SUBSEQUENT EVENT - MERGER WITH SOCIETY CORPORATION

On March 1, 1994, KeyCorp merged with and into Society Corporation ("Society")
of Cleveland, Ohio, and the combined corporation changed its name to KeyCorp.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, 124,351,183 shares of new KeyCorp 
Common Stock were exchanged for all of the outstanding shares of KeyCorp Common
Stock based upon an exchange ratio of 1.205 shares of new KeyCorp Common Stock
for each share of KeyCorp Common Stock. The outstanding preferred stock of
KeyCorp was exchanged for 1,280,000 shares of comparable, newly-created issue 
of 10% Cumulative Preferred Stock of the new KeyCorp. The merger was accounted
for as a pooling of interests and as a tax-free exchange for KeyCorp 
stockholders.

Society is a bank holding company which provides traditional banking and 
associated financial services to consumer, business, and commercial markets
through 434 full service banking offices in Ohio, Florida, Indiana, and 
Michigan. Society also has one of the largest investment management and trust
businesses in the United States, and provides a full range of investment and 
fiduciary services to institutions and individuals. At December 31, 1993, 
Society and its consolidated subsidiaries had total assets of $27.0 billion, 
total deposits of $19.9 billion, and shareholders' equity of $2.0 billion.

In connection with the merger, KeyCorp recognized in the fourth quarter of 1993
merger and restructuring charges amounting to $64.8 million ($41.1 million
after tax, $.41 per common share). These charges, which are directly
attributable to the merger, included accruals for severance, relocation and
other employee costs ($32.0 million), systems and facilities costs ($19.0
million), merger transaction costs consisting primarily of investment banking,
legal and accounting fees ($7.9 million) and other charges incident to the
merger ($5.9 million). These charges were recorded by the parent company in the
fourth quarter of 1993 at which time management determined that it was
probable that a liability for such charges had been incurred and could be
reasonably estimated.

The following table presents net interest income, net income and net income
per Common Share reported by each of the companies and on a combined basis.

NOTE 3. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

Jackson County Federal Bank

On December 31, 1993, Jackson County Federal Bank of Medford, Oregon ("JCF")
merged into Key Bank of Oregon, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of KeyCorp.
Approximately 1.2 million shares of KeyCorp common stock were issued to the 
holders of JCF common and preferred stock. The transaction qualified for 
accounting as a pooling of interests; however, financial statements for periods
prior to the merger have not been restated to include the accounts and results
of operations of JCF because the transaction was not material to KeyCorp. JCF 
had total assets of $338 million at the date of the merger.

Northwestern National Bank

On July 22, 1993, Northwestern National Bank of Port Angeles, Washington 
("NNB") merged into Key Bank of Washington, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary
of KeyCorp. Approximately 0.3 million shares of KeyCorp common stock were 
issued to the holders of NNB common stock. The transaction was treated as a 
purchase for accounting purposes. NNB had total assets of $49 million at the
date of the acquisition.

Emerald City Bank

On July 2, 1993, Key Bank of Washington, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
KeyCorp, assumed $7.2 million of deposits of the failed Emerald City Bank of
Seattle, Washington in an FDIC-assisted transaction.

Home Federal Savings Bank

On June 30, 1993, Home Federal Savings Bank of Fort Collins, Colorado ("Home 
Federal") merged into Key Bank of Colorado, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KeyCorp
formed for the purposes of consummating the merger. Approximately 0.5 million 
shares of KeyCorp common stock were issued to the holders of Home Federal 
common stock. The transaction qualified for accounting as a pooling of 
interests; however, financial statements for periods prior to the merger have
not been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of Home 
Federal because the transaction was not material to KeyCorp. Home Federal had 
total assets of $230 million at the date of the merger.

First American Bank of New York

On March 25, 1993, Key Bank of New York, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
KeyCorp, acquired all of the deposits and the majority of the assets of First 
American Bank of New York ("First American"). Key Bank of New York acquired 40
branches (thirty-nine branches in upstate New York and one branch in New York 
City) and other business operations with approximately $1.0 billion in deposits
and approximately $600 million in loans, in addition to branch real estate and
other physical assets. The transaction was treated as a purchase for accounting
purposes. Key Bank paid a premium of $40.6 million on the acquired deposits. In
connection with the transaction, Key Bank of New York recorded a preliminary 
core deposit intangible of $33.0 million and goodwill of $8.0 million. 
Separately, Key Bank of New York sold the branch in New York City on July 8, 
1993.

National Savings Bank of Albany

On February 26, 1993, National Savings Bank ("National") of Albany, New York
merged into Key Bank of New York, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of 
KeyCorp. Approximately 1.75 million shares of KeyCorp common stock were 
issued to the holders of National common stock. The transaction qualified for
accounting as a pooling of interests; however, financial statements for periods
prior to the merger have not been restated to include the accounts and results
of operations of National because the transaction was not material to KeyCorp. 
National had total assets of $671 million at the date of the merger.

Puget Sound Bancorp

On January 15, 1993, Puget Sound Bancorp ("PSB"), a bank holding company 
headquartered in Tacoma, Washington, merged into Key Bancshares of Washington,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of KeyCorp. KeyCorp issued 26.4 million 
shares of common stock to the shareholders of PSB common stock. PSB 
shareholders received 1.32 shares of KeyCorp's common stock for each share of
PSB common stock.

The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, pre-
merger historical financial information has been restated to include the 
accounts of PSB.

In the fourth quarter of 1992, KeyCorp and PSB recorded one-time pretax 
restructuring charges of $7.7 million and $35.0 million, respectively, related
to the merger. The restructuring charges resulted primarily from employee
severance and retention expenses, investment banking fees and branch closing
expenses. PSB also increased allowances related to the planned sale of out-of-
market loans and disposition of other real estate.

Security Pacific Bank Branches

On September 3, 1992, Key Bank of Washington ("Key Bank"), a wholly-owned 
indirect subsidiary of KeyCorp, acquired 48 branches and other business and 
private banking operations with approximately $1.3 billion in deposits and 
$709 million in loans in addition to branch real estate and other physical 
assets in the state of Washington from BankAmerica Corporation. The transaction
was accounted for as a purchase. Key Bank paid a premium of $53.6 million on 
the acquired deposits.
<PAGE> 9
Olympic Savings Bank

On July 31, 1992, Key Savings Bank ("Key Savings"), a wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of KeyCorp, acquired Olympic Savings Bank of Washington
("Olympic"). The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Olympic had
$81.0 million in assets at the date of acquisition. $2.8 million in cash was
paid to the shareholders of Olympic.

Valley Bancorporation

On June 4, 1992, Valley Bancorporation (Valley) of Idaho Falls, Idaho was 
merged with Key Bancshares of Idaho, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KeyCorp. 
KeyCorp issued 0.7 million shares of KeyCorp common stock for all of the 
outstanding shares of Valley common stock. The transaction qualified for 
accounting as a pooling of interests; however, financial statements for periods
prior to the merger have not been restated to include the accounts and results
of operations of Valley because the transaction was not material to KeyCorp.
Valley had total assets of $221 million at the date of merger.

Intangible Assets

In connection with the purchase transactions presented above, goodwill totaling
$16.3 million in 1993 and $2.0 million in 1992 was initially recorded and is 
being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 5 to 25
years (See Note 10, Intangible Assets and Purchased Mortgage Servicing Rights).

Pending Acquisitions

Commercial Bancorporation of Colorado

On September 11, 1993, KeyCorp agreed to acquire Commercial Bancorporation of 
Colorado ("CBC"), headquartered in Denver. Holders of CBC common stock will 
receive KeyCorp common stock based on an exchange ratio of .746 shares of 
KeyCorp common stock (.899 shares of new KeyCorp common stock, see Note 2) 
for each outstanding share of CBC common stock. Shareholders of CBC approved 
the Agreement at a Special Meeting held on February 22, 1994. The Agreement 
is subject to the approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities. It is 
anticipated that the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of 
interests and that it will close in March of 1994. CBC, a bank holding company
with subsidiary banks operating ten branch offices in the Denver, Colorado
Springs, Sterling and Fort Collins areas of Colorado, had total assets of $390

NOTE 8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Certain executive officers, directors and their associates (as defined by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission) have loans and other transactions with the
subsidiary banks. Such transactions are made on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral required, as those prevailing for
similar transactions with others. The aggregate amount of loans outstanding to
qualifying related parties at January 1, 1993, was $106.3 million. During 1993,
activity with respect to these loans included new loans, repayments and a net
decrease (due to changes in the status of executive officers and directors) of
$118.5 million, $77.4 million and $18.7 million, respectively, resulting in an
aggregate balance of loans outstanding to related parties at December 31, 1993,
of $128.7 million.

NOTE 9. PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

The Corporation's executive offices are in Albany, New York. At December 31,
1993, KeyCorp's banking subsidiaries operated 833 offices, of which 515 were 
owned and 318 were leased. Certain leases, expiring at various dates through
the year 2010, qualify as capital leases and contain purchase options for the
premises leased thereunder. At December 31, 1993, banking subsidiaries of the
Corporation were obligated under noncancellable operating leases for land and 
buildings and for other property consisting principally of data processing 
equipment. Many of the realty lease agreements contain renewal options for 
varying periods. In many cases, renewal terms, including annual rentals to be 
paid, must be negotiated at the renewal date. The leases generally require 
payment of maintenance costs and real estate taxes in excess of specified 
minimums. There are no significant encumbrances on properties owned.

Rental expense under all operating leases totaled $70.3 million in 1993, 
$60.1 million in 1992 and $53.9 million in 1991. Minimum future rental 
payments under noncancellable leases at December 31, 1993, are as follows: 
1994-$61.6 million; 1995-$58.3 million; 1996-$53.2 million; 1997-$50.4 million;
1998-$37.6 million; and subsequent years-$286.2 million.

Depreciation and amortization expense related to premises and equipment totaled
$53.0 million, $42.5 million, and $35.4 million in 1993, 1992, and 1991 
respectively.

</TABLE>

Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over periods generally not
exceeding twenty-five years. Core deposit intangibles represent the net 
present value of the future economic benefits related to the use of deposits
purchased. They are being amortized on an accelerated basis over periods 
ranging from 7 to 14 years. Other intangibles are generally being amortized
using the straight-line method over periods ranging from five to ten years.

The 1993 amortization expense for goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and other
intangibles was $12.3 million, $16.9 million, and $2.9 million, respectively.

The 1993 amortization expense for purchased mortgage servicing rights was $56.1
million. The amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights capitalized during 
1993 was $77.3 million.

securities sold under repurchase agreements, which generally represent 
overnight borrowing transactions. Other short-term borrowings consist
primarily of Treasury tax and loan demand notes and commercial paper of the 
Corporation which is issued primarily in amounts of $100,000 or more with 
maturities of one year or less.

On June 29, 1992, KeyCorp issued $125 million of subordinated debt. Proceeds 
from these twelve-year notes were used to retire without penalty all of its 
11.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity. Proceeds were also employed to provide 
capital for Key Bank of Washington. This capital infusion was made in 
anticipation of Key Bank of Washington's purchase of 48 former Security Pacific
Bank branches from BankAmerica on September 3, 1992.

Additionally, KeyCorp issued $77 million of medium-term notes during 1992. 
KeyCorp used the proceeds from the issuance of medium-term notes principally 
to provide subordinated capital to subsidiary banks and to fund the purchase 
of OREO from subsidiary banks by NCB Properties Inc., KeyCorp's OREO workout
subsidiary.

On July 27, 1992, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a 
shelf registration of KeyCorp debt securities. The shelf registration may be 
used to offer up to $400 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities.
As of December 31, 1992, $40 million of subordinated medium-term notes had been
issued under the shelf registration.

On May 6, 1993 and May 27, 1993, KeyCorp retired prior to maturity, and without
penalty, all of its floating rate subordinated notes due 1997 and all of its 
7.75% Debentures due to 2002, respectively. On June 1, 1993, KeyCorp's 9.45% 
Senior Notes matured.

A total of $194.5 million of medium-term notes were issued during 1993. KeyCorp
used the proceeds from the issuance of $125.0 million of subordinated medium-
term notes to retire and pay the principal on the above referenced notes and 
debentures and to fund the purchase of OREO from subsidiary banks by NCB 
Properties Inc.

NOTE 14. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

On March 1, 1994, KeyCorp merged with and into Society and the combined 
corporation changed its name to KeyCorp. Under the terms of the merger 
agreement, shares of new KeyCorp were exchanged for all of the outstanding 
shares of KeyCorp. See Note 2 Subsequent Event - Merger with Society 
Corporation, for further discussion.

At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of KeyCorp held on April 22, 1993, the 
shareholders approved an Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to 
increase the number of shares of common stock which KeyCorp shall have 
authority to issue from 175,000,000 to 350,000,000.

Preferred Stock

At December 31, 1993, KeyCorp had 10,000,000 shares of $5 par value, non-voting
preferred stock authorized of which 1,280,000 shares of Series B were 
outstanding represented by 6,400,000 Depositary Shares. Each Depositary Share 
represents a one-fifth interest in a share of 10% Cumulative Preferred Stock, 
Series B, $125 liquidation preference per share. Preferred Stock is reported 
on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at its per share liquidation 
value of $125.

Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of 
original issue and are payable quarterly, at the rate of 10 percent per annum. 
The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to June 30, 1996 and is 
redeemable at the option of KeyCorp (subject to Federal Reserve Board approval)
at $125 per share ($25 per Depositary Share) plus unpaid dividends accrued to 
the redemption date.

Except for a limited right to elect two Directors if full cumulative dividends 
have not been paid for six quarterly dividend periods, and a right to vote as a 
class on amendments to the KeyCorp Certificate of Incorporation which could 
adversely affect the rights of the Preferred Shareholders, the shareholders of 
Series B Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote.

KeyCorp redeemed all outstanding shares of its Series A Preferred Stock in 
August 1993 without premium at a redemption price of $50 per share. The total 
cost of redeeming the Series A Preferred Stock was $24.0 million.

Common Stock

Concurrent with the KeyCorp/Society Merger Agreement (see Note 2), KeyCorp 
entered into a Shareholder Rights Protection Agreement dated October 1, 1993, 
pursuant to which holders of record on October 15, 1993 of KeyCorp common 
stock received one Right for each share of the Corporation. Each Right 
represents the right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of participating
preferred stock, par value $5 per share, for $115 subject to adjustment. The 
rights become exercisable 10 days after a person or group acquires 20% or more
of the outstanding shares of KeyCorp Common Stock or commences a tender offer
that could result in such an ownership interest. Until the Rights become
exercisable, they will trade with the common shares, and any transfer of the
common shares will also constitute a transfer of associated Rights. When the
Rights become exercisable, they will begin to trade separate and apart from 
the common shares. The Corporation may redeem these Rights at its option at 
$.01 per Right subject to certain limitations. The KeyCorp Rights will not 
prevent a takeover of KeyCorp. However, the KeyCorp Rights may cause 
substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 20% or more of the 
KeyCorp Common Stock unless the KeyCorp Rights are first redeemed by the Board
of Directors of KeyCorp. The merger with Society Corporation did not activate 
the provisions of the Rights.

At December 31, 1993, approximately 4,898,404 shares of common stock were 
reserved for issuance under KeyCorp's Dividend Reinvestment, Employee Stock 
Purchase, and Stock Option Plans.

Stock Options

The Corporation has various stock option plans which allow for the granting of 
stock options to key employees and directors of KeyCorp. In accordance with the
plans, options may be granted from time to time at a purchase price per share 
of 100% of the fair market value on the grant date. Once granted, the options 
can be exercised over a period of ten years from the date of the grant.

In addition, the plans allow for the granting of stock appreciation rights 
(SARs) in tandem with options. During 1991 all outstanding SARs were exercised.
There are no SARs outstanding at December 31, 1993.

A summary of activity under the plans follows:

In 1991, the Board of Directors approved grants to certain officers of KeyCorp
and its subsidiaries under the Career Equity Program ("Program"). The Program 
is designed to increase equity ownership by the participants, who make an 
initial investment and elect to have options automatically exercised at regular
intervals when share value appreciation is present. At exercise, replacement 
option grants are made at the current market value. Shares received under the 
Program are restricted as to resale during the five-year period of the Program.

NOTE 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Corporation sponsors a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan 
covering substantially all of its employees. Benefits are principally based on
an employee's years of service and the highest five consecutive years of base
salary during the last ten years of service. The Corporation's funding policy
is to contribute amounts to the plan which meet the minimum funding 
requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
plus such additional amounts as the Corporation determines to be appropriate. 
Contributions are intended to provide both for benefits attributed to service 
to date and for those that are expected to be earned in the future.

The following table sets forth the status of the funded plan and the amounts 
recognized in the Corporation's consolidated balance sheets at December 31:

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the projected benefit 
obligation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 was 7.25% and 7.75%, respectively. 
The assumed rate of increase in future compensation was 4% and 5% as of 
December 31, 1993, and 1992, respectively. The expected long-term rate of 
return on plan assets was 10.5% in 1991 through 1993.

The Corporation also maintains an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental 
executive retirement program that provides certain officers defined pension 
benefits in excess of limits imposed by Federal law. The following table sets 
forth the status of the unfunded plan and amounts recognized in the 
Corporation's consolidated balance sheets at December 31:

The Corporation sponsors the KeyCorp Profit Sharing Plus Plan (the 401(k) 
Plan), a defined contribution profit sharing plan with cash or deferral 
arrangements permitted by Internal Revenue Code subsection 401(k). 
Substantially all employees are eligible to participate after satisfaction of 
the one year service requirement under the plan. Under the savings aspect of 
the plan, employees may contribute 1% to 10% of base compensation with up to 
6% being eligible for matching contributions from the Corporation. In addition
to a mandatory match, the Corporation, after determining its net income, may 
make an additional match, or contribute additional amounts to the 401(k) Plan,
which are then allocated to each plan participant in proportion to their 
eligible salary. Contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $16.4 million, $12.3 
million and $9.3 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The Corporation sponsors defined benefit postretirement plans that cover 
substantially all employees. The plans provide medical and death benefits. 
The postretirement medical plan is contributory, with contributions adjusted 
annually; the death benefit is noncontributory. Employee contributions are 
based on years of service and are adjusted annually. The accounting for the 
medical plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the written plan that
are consistent with the Corporation's expressed intent to increase retiree 
contributions each year. The Corporation elected to adopt prospectively 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (FAS 106) on January 1, 1993.
<PAGE> 20
FAS 106 requires that the projected future cost of retiree health and life 
insurance be accrued over the employees' working careers. Prior to the change,
cost were charged to expense as incurred. Postretirement benefit expense was
$5.0 million in 1993 (including $3.5 million due to the application of the new
standard), $2.5 million in 1992 and $1.8 million in 1991.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 included the following 
components:

Because the Corporation fixed its contribution for postretirement medical 
benefits at 1993 levels, a health care cost trend assumption was not used in 
the determination of obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
for medical benefits.

The weighted average discount rates used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation are 7.75% and 7.25% as of January 1, 1993 and
December 31, 1993, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets was 10.5% as of January 1,1993 and will be 9.5% for 1994.

The Corporation's postretirement medical plan is unfunded; the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation and plan assets as of January 1, 1993 were 
$25.9 million and $0, respectively. The Corporation has adopted a funding 
policy for its postretirement death benefit plan and annually contributes the 
service cost for active employees not fully eligible for benefits plus an 
amount to amortize the unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
over a 30-year period; as of January 1, 1993, the accumulated postretirement 
benefit obligation and plan assets were $4.7 million and $.3 million, 
respectively.

NOTE 17. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND OTHER DISCLOSURES

Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks, Subsidiary Dividends and Lending 
Activities

Under the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, depository institutions are 
required to maintain certain average balances in the form of cash or 
noninterest-bearing balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. Average reserve 
balances aggregating $630.9 million in 1993 were maintained in fulfillment of 
these requirements.

The principal source of income for the parent company is dividends from its 
subsidiary banks. Such dividends are subject to certain restrictions as set 
forth in the national and state banking laws and regulations. At December 31, 
1993, undistributed earnings of $459.4 million were free of such restrictions 
and available for the payment of dividends to the parent company.

Loans and advances from banking subsidiaries to the parent company are also 
limited by law and are required to be collateralized.

Legal Proceedings

Although KeyCorp and its subsidiaries are defendants in various legal 
proceedings arising in the course of business, there are no legal proceedings 
pending which, in the opinion of management and counsel, may result in a 
material loss to the Corporation.

<PAGE> 23
NOTE 18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

The Corporation, in the normal course of its business to meet the financing 
needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in 
interest rates, is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet 
risk. These instruments expose the Corporation to credit risk in addition to 
amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.

The Corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and 
conditional obligations as it does for making loans. In the opinion of 
management, the Corporation's outstanding commitments do not represent unusual
risks for KeyCorp. The exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by the other party to the financial instrument for these commitments is 
represented by the contractual amount.

A summary of credit exposure related to these items at December 31, 1993 is 
shown below:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
<FN>
<F1> Includes commitments to extend credit through overdraft facilities
or commercial lines of credit, retail check credit and related plans,
and mortgage loans.
</TABLE>

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at a future 
date, subject to the meeting of the contractual terms. Commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require
payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without
being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
actual future cash requirements of the Corporation. The Corporation evaluates 
each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.

Financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit are 
conditional commitments issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance
of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of
credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to
customers.

A KeyCorp mortgage banking affiliate originates and services residential 
mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market. Prior to 1992 
residential mortgages were sold with provisions for recourse by a mortgage 
banking company acquired by KeyCorp. At December 31, 1993, the amount of such 
loans sold with recourse to the acquired mortgage banking company was $140.4 
million. KeyCorp has not and does not sell residential mortgages with 
provisions for recourse.

Sales commitments and option contracts may be used by KeyCorp's mortgage 
subsidiary to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates on mortgage 
loans held for sale. At December 31, 1993, KeyCorp's mortgage subsidiary was 
committed to deliver, at dates throughout 1994, $958.3 million of mortgage 
loans under forward sale agreements. In addition, at December 31, 1993, 
KeyCorp's mortgage subsidiary had entered into options to purchase $45.0 
million of loans at a specified price. KeyCorp enters into interest rate swap 
agreements to alter the interest rate characteristics of existing assets or 
liabilities arising in the normal course of business.

The Corporation has limited the extension of loan commitments to customers 
within the states served by its banking subsidiaries. The following table 
presents the geographic distribution of unused loan commitments by state at
December 31, 1993:

NOTE 19. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

In December 1991, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement 
107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" (SFAS 107). SFAS 
107 requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, 
whether or not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to 
estimate that value. "Fair value" is defined in SFAS 107 as the amount at which
an instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing 
parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. It is not the 
Corporation's intent to enter into such exchanges.

"Financial instruments" is defined in SFAS 107 to include categories listed 
below but does not include the value of separate intangible assets such as 
customer relationships, purchased mortgage servicing rights and core deposit 
intangibles which, if considered an integral part of the related financial 
instruments, would increase their fair values.

The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Corporation using
relevant market information, where available. No considerations or allowances 
are made in the estimation of fair value for differences that may result due 
to volume and size of market. Certain of the Corporation's financial 
instruments are not represented in an active market as characterized by a 
willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an arms-length exchange 
transaction. It is also the Corporation's general practice and intent to hold 
these financial instruments to maturity. For such financial instruments, 
discounted cash flow methodologies were employed to estimate fair value.
Generally, the discount rates utilized are derived from the risk-free Treasury 
rates, adjusted for credit risk, operating expense factors and service charges.
These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of 
significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. Changes in 
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

All estimates are based upon pertinent information available to management as 
of December 31, 1993 and 1992. Although management is not aware of additional 
factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such 
amounts have not been subsequently revalued for purposes of these financial 
statements since these dates and, therefore, current estimates of fair value 
may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in 
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and Due from Banks and Short-Term Investments

The carrying amounts for cash and due from banks and short-term investments 
approximate those assets' fair values. 

Loans Held for Sale

The carrying value of loans held for sale approximates their fair values.

Securities Available for Sale and Investment Securities

As included in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, fair 
values for securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If 
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market
prices of comparable instruments.

Loans

The fair value of loans receivable is estimated by discounting their expected 
future cash flows.

in millions 1993 1992
- -----------------------------------------------
Net carrying amount $21,388 $19,432
Fair value 21,517 19,408
- -----------------------------------------------

The Corporation has no plan to dispose of these loans either in part or in 
their entirety. Furthermore, the Corporation believes that considerable 
customer franchise value exists in the accounts represented above; a high 
percentage of these customers have had previous relationships with the 
Corporation and are expected to continue their business with the Corporation 
following satisfaction of current obligations. However, franchise value 
estimates have not been incorporated into the fair value identified herein as
these amounts are not included in SFAS 107's definition of "financial 
instruments."

Deposits

SFAS 107 defines the fair values of certain deposits (for example, interest and
noninterest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market 
accounts) to equal the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (that is,
their carrying amounts). Similarly, the carrying amounts for variable rate, 
fixed-term money market accounts and certificates of deposit approximate their
fair values at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of
deposit are estimated by discounting their expected future cash flows.

Carrying amount $26,618 $24,775
Fair value 26,749 24,870
- -----------------------------------------------
<PAGE> 25
Short-Term Borrowings

The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase 
agreements, and other short-term borrowings approximate their fair values.

Long-Term Debt

The fair values of the Corporation's long-term debt are estimated by 
discounting expected future cash flows.

in millions 1993 1992
- --------------------------------------------
Carrying Amount $811 $904
Fair Value 871 894
- --------------------------------------------

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

As described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the 
Corporation was a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk 
at December 31, 1993 and 1992. Such financial instruments consist of 
commitments to extend permanent financing and letters of credit. If the options
are exercised by the prospective borrowers, these financial instruments will
become interest-earning assets of the Corporation. If the options expire,
the Corporation retains fees paid by the counterparty in order to enter into 
the commitment or guarantee.

The fair value of guarantees and letters of credit is based on fees currently
charged for similar agreements. The fair value of these off-balance sheet
items at December 31, 1993 and 1992 approximates the recorded amounts of the
related fees.

Interest Rate Swap and Cap Agreements

As described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the 
Corporation is a party to interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31,
1993 and 1992 and interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 1992. The fair 
value of interest rate swap agreements is based upon a discounted cash flow
analysis utilizing current assumptions. The fair value of interest rate cap 
agreements is based upon the current fees charged to enter into such contracts.
At December 31, 1992, the balance of the unamortized fees incurred to enter 
into such interest rate cap agreements approximates their fair value.

Considerations

The fair value estimates presented are based on existing on- and off-balance
sheet financial instruments, as defined by SFAS 107. No attempt has been made
to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the fair value of 
assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments by SFAS 
107. In fact, significant income is generated from operations of the 
Corporation which are not related to the generation, retention and settlement 
of financial instruments. For example, the trust operation and the mortgage
banking operation contribute considerable service fee income. Other significant
assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments include 
the brokerage network, insurance operations, leasing operation, property, 
plant, equipment and goodwill. In addition, the tax ramifications related to 
the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have significant effect
on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
