Item 5. Other Events.

On August 5, 1994, the Registrant entered into a Stock Purchase 
Agreement with Crowley Cellular Telecommunications Limited Partnership 
("Crowley LP") and Crowley Cellular Telecommunications Binghamton, Inc. 
("Crowley Inc.") to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Crowley Inc. for 
a purchase price of $48,539,250, subject to certain closing adjustments. 
Crowley LP is the sole shareholder of Crowley Inc. Crowley Inc. is the 
Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") license holder for the 
nonwireline cellular telephone system in the Elmira, New York metropolitan 
statistical area ("Elmira MSA") and is the general partner and 97% owner 
of the partnership that is the FCC license holder for the nonwireline 
cellular telephone system in the Binghamton, New York metropolitan 
statistical area ("Binghamton MSA").

The purchase price is payable, at Registrant's option, in cash or 
Class A Common Stock of the Registrant, or any combination thereof, provided 
that the amount of Class A Common Stock delivered cannot equal or exceed 5% of 
the Registrant's outstanding stock after giving effect to the issuance 
thereof. Any stock issued by Registrant in payment of part or all of the 
purchase price must be subject to a then effective registration statement 
under the Securities Act of 1933 for resale to the public. Historical 
financial statements are included herewith on pages 3 through 12 and pro 
forma financial information with respect to this pending acquisition are 
included herewith on pages 13 through 18 and the Stock Purchase Agreement 
is incorporated by reference as an exhibit hereto.

On September 26, 1994, the Registrant entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement with Sunshine Cellular, a general partnership ("Sunshine"), to
acquire all of the assets of Sunshine for a purchase price of $50,350,000,
subject to certain closing adjustments. Sunshine is the FCC license holder
for the nonwireline cellular telephone system in the Pennsylvania 8-Union
rural service area ("PA-8 RSA").

The purchase price consists of $15,000,000 in cash with the remainder
payable, at Registrant's option, in cash or Class A Common Stock of the
Registrant, or any combination thereof. Any stock issued by Registrant in
payment of part or all of the purchase price must be subject to a then
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 for resale
to the public. It is impracticable to provide at this time historical
financial statements and pro forma financial information with 

1

<PAGE>

respect to the pending acquisition of Sunshine. The Asset Purchase Agreement 
is filed as an exhibit hereto.

In addition to the foregoing, the Registrant entered into an 
agreement on July 5, 1994 to acquire the holder of the FCC licenses for the 
West Virginia 1- Mason rural service area ("WV-1 RSA") and the Maine 4 - 
Washington rural service area ("ME-4 RSA") for an aggregate purchase price of 
approximately $6.7 million in cash and $3.3 million in Class A Common Stock, 
subject to certain closing adjustments. This transaction does not involve 
businesses which are significant under Regulation S-X. Accordingly, financial 
statements and pro forma financial information are not included herein with 
respect thereto nor is the acquisition agreement filed as an exhibit.

The closing of each of the foregoing transactions is subject to 
customary conditions and regulatory approvals. The acquisition of the Elmira 
and Binghamton MSAs and the WV-1 and ME-4 RSAs are expected to occur prior to 
the end of 1994. The closing of the acquisition of the PA-8 RSA is expected to
occur in the first quarter of 1995.

The terms of each of the foregoing transactions were arrived at 
through private negotiation and were based primarily on the "pops" for the 
markets to be acquired. Each of the markets to be acquired are operational 
and the Registrant intends to continue to use the assets of the acquired 
markets in those respective markets.

The Registrant expects to fund any cash portion of the purchase prices
for the foregoing pending acquisitions through its loan agreement entered into
in 1993 with various leaders led by the Bank of New York and Toronto Dominion
Bank (the "1993 Loan Agreement"). Any such funding would require approval of
its lenders. In addition, depending upon the availability of funds under the
1993 Loan Agreement at closing of each acquisition, the Registrant may need
alternative sources of financing to fund part or all of the acquisition with
cash. As of June 30, 1994, the Registrant had $103.5 available under the 1993
Loan Agreement; however, additional borrowings in excess of $20.0 million for
acquisition would require lender approval.

CROWLEY CELLULAR TELECOMMUNICATIONS BINGHAMTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 1993

(Six Months Ended June 30, 1993 and 1994, are Unaudited)

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND
REPORTING POLICIES:

Crowley Cellular Telecommunications Binghamton, Inc. (the
Company--a wholly owned subsidiary of Crowley Cellular
Telecommunications, L.P. (CCTLP)) was formed on August 10,
1988, to conduct cellular operations in Elmira, New York,
under a franchise issued by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). The Company also maintains a majority
investment (96.9651% at December 31, 1993, 95.965% at June 30,
1993, and 96.9651% at June 30, 1994) in Binghamton CellTelCo.
(BCTC), which conducts cellular operations in Binghamton,
New York, under a franchise issued by the FCC. The franchises
are geographically limited to specific market boundaries
defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Areas, or SMSA's.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

On July 27, 1993, the Company acquired an additional 1.0001%
ownership interest in its majority-owned subsidiary for
$230,000.

Inventory 

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined under the
first-in, first-out method, or market. All inventory is
finished goods.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Property and
equipment are being depreciated or amortized using an
accelerated method. The estimated useful lives are as
follows:

7
<PAGE>

Asset Description Asset Life

Leasehold improvements 31.5 years
Buildings 31.5 years
Towers 7 years
Switching equipment 7 years
Network equipment 7 years
Microwave equipment 7 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 to 7 years
Vehicles 5 years

Other Assets

Other assets include cellular franchise costs, which represent
amounts paid to acquire the FCC authorizations, and
organization, start-up, financing, software license and
reorganization costs. These assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the following lives:

Asset Description Asset Life

Cellular franchise costs 15 years
Organization and start-up 5 years
costs
Financing costs 9 years
Software license costs 5 years
Reorganization costs 5 years

Income Taxes

In February, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a 
change from the deferred method to the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the
tax consequences of "temporary differences" by applying
enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 109 effective January 1, 1993.

Partnership losses of BCTC have been included in the taxable
income of the Company to the extent of allocations in
accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Due
to net losses incurred, no income taxes are due and,
accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been reflected
in the accompanying statements of operations. The Company has
aggregate tax net operating losses (which approximate book net
operating losses) of approximately $11,300,000, $10,700,000
and $11,700,000 as of December 31, 1993, and June 30, 1993 and
1994, respectively, which may be utilized to offset future
taxable income of the Company. The Company has not recognized
any benefit to be derived from future recognition of net
operating losses.

8
<PAGE>

Revenues

Cellular service revenue is recognized when earned. Recurring
monthly subscriber revenues are billed in advance. The
unearned portion of the subscriber revenue is deferred and
included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Sales of mobile phone equipment and related
services are recorded at the point the goods and services are
delivered.

Interim Financial Data

In management's opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 1993
and 1994, are presented on a basis consistent with the audited
consolidated financial statements, and all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are
necessary to present fairly the operating results have been
reflected. The results of operations for interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of operations for the full fiscal
year.

2. BANK NOTES PAYABLE:

The Company has approximately $6,900,000 outstanding at
December 31, 1993, under a Third Amended and Restated Loan
Agreement (Agreement) dated January 7, 1992. The Agreement is
between the shareholder and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
including the Company, and various banks. Interest is payable
quarterly at adjusted prime (6% at December 31, 1993, 6.5% at
June 30, 1993, and 7.25% at June 30, 1994) or LIBOR plus 1%
(5% and 4.5625% at December 31, 1993, 5.6875% at June 30,
1993, and 5% and 4.5625% at June 30, 1994).

Under the Agreement, up to $35,000,000 is available to the
Company and up to $35,000,000 is available to the
shareholder's entire subsidiary group, subject to the
maintenance of certain covenants and overall borrowing
limitations for the shareholder's entire subsidiary group. At
December 31, 1993, available borrowings totaled $35,000,000
for the shareholder's entire subsidiary group. The
shareholder's subsidiaries are required to pay commitment fees
equal to 1/2% per annum on the excess of available borrowings
over amounts outstanding and 1/8% per annum on the excess of
the original commitment over available borrowings. There are
no compensating balances required.

The Agreement calls for the shareholder's subsidiaries to
maintain certain quarterly financial ratios, which include
debt to the population of the markets served by the
subsidiaries, along with other financial ratios. In addition, 
the Agreement places certain restrictions on, among other
things, the use of funds, additional indebtedness, payment of
dividends by the shareholder's subsidiaries and the sale of
assets or the stock of the shareholder's subsidiaries. As of
December 31, 1993, and June 30, 1994, the shareholder's
subsidiaries were in compliance with all requirements.

Amounts outstanding under the Agreement are secured by the
joint and several guarantee of each subsidiary of the
shareholder and by all of the subsidiaries' assets. In
addition, the shareholder has pledged the stock of each
subsidiary as security and each limited partner of the
shareholder and each shareholder of the shareholder's general
partner has also pledged his partnership interest and stock,
respectively, as additional security.

9

<PAGE>

The amounts outstanding under the Agreement were converted to
term loans on June 30, 1994, which mature over a period of six
years. Under the provisions of the term loans, bank notes
payable as of December 31, 1993, will mature as follows:

1994 $ 575,362
1995 1,150,724
1996 1,150,724
1997 1,150,724
1998 1,150,724
1999 and
thereafter 1,726,088

$6,904,346

Certain provisions of the Agreement require the shareholder's
subsidiaries to make prepayments should certain levels of cash
flow, as defined, be achieved. No prepayments were required
under these provisions during 1993.

3. SUBORDINATED NOTES PAYABLE:

Subordinated notes payable consist of notes payable to limited
partners of the shareholder, bearing interest at 8%. Notes
payable to limited partners of the shareholder are subordinate
to all other debt of the Company. The outstanding amounts are
secured by the stock of the Company. In addition, each
limited partner of the shareholder and each shareholder of the
shareholder's general partner has pledged his partnership
interest and stock, respectively, as additional security. The
amounts outstanding under these notes mature on June 30, 1995;
however, under the terms of the Agreement described in Note 2,
the creditors have agreed not to demand payment until
September 30, 1999, 90 days following an acceleration of the
bank notes payable, or 365 days following an event of default
under the agreements between these subordinated lenders and
the Company, whichever occurs first.

4. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Crowley Cellular Telecommunications, Inc. (CCTI), the general
partner of the shareholder, performs certain administrative
services on behalf of the Company and its subsidiary.
MLC Industries, Inc. (MLC), whose shareholders are limited
partners of CCTLP, manages the operations and performs certain
administrative services on behalf of the Company. Certain
costs allocated for these services, totaling approximately
$510,000, $259,000 and $272,000 during the year ended
December 31, 1993, and the six months ended June 30, 1993 and
1994, respectively, are included in general and administrative
expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

Management and director's fees of approximately $23,000,
$11,400 and $11,400 were paid to a partner of CCTLP during the
year ended December 31, 1993, and the six months ended
June 30, 1993 and 1994, respectively.

<PAGE>

5. LEASES:

The Company leases office equipment and rents office and tower
facilities under operating lease agreements. These leases
expire at various times through 2017. At December 31, 1993,
future minimum annual lease payments under these operating
leases are as follows:

Rent expense for 1993 was $186,000. Rent expense for the six
months ended June 30, 1993 and 1994, was $85,000 and $102,000,
respectively.

6. OTHER INCOME:

In 1992, the Company received $2,000,000 for an agreement not
to compete entered into in connection with the shareholder's
sale of certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries. This amount
was deferred and is being amortized into income over the
three-year term of the agreement. Accordingly, $666,667,
$333,333 and $333,333 of other income is reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the
year ended December 31, 1993, and the six months ended
June 30, 1993 and 1994, respectively.

7. EVENTS (UNAUDITED) SUBSEQUENT TO
DATE OF AUDITORS' REPORT:

In July, 1994, CCTLP contributed capital of $1,340,000 to the
Company. The Company used the capital contribution to retire
subordinated notes payable of $1,340,000.

In August, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with an
unrelated third party to sell all of its outstanding common
stock for approximately $48,500,000, subject to certain closing 
adjustments. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary 
conditions and regulatory approvals.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholder of
Crowley Cellular Telecommunications
Binghamton, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
CROWLEY CELLULAR TELECOMMUNICATIONS BINGHAMTON, INC. (a
Delaware corporation) AND SUBSIDIARY as of December 31, 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash
flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Crowley Cellular Telecommunications Binghamton,
Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1993, and their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

VANGUARD CELLULAR SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated
financial information of Vanguard Cellular Systems, Inc. and
Subsidiaries (the Registrant) gives effect to the pending
acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in Crowley Cellular
Telecommunications Binghamton, Inc. (CCTB) (the "Crowley
Transaction"). CCTB owns and operates the cellular system
serving the Elmira, New York MSA and also owns a 97% interest
in Binghamton CellTelCo, an operating cellular partnership
serving the Binghamton, New York MSA. The purchase price for
this acquisition is approximately $48.5 million. The following 
financial information assumes that the acquisition is financed with the
issuance of the Registrant's Class A Common Stock, subject to
a limitation specified in the purchase agreement that the
amount of Class A Common Stock issued cannot equal or exceed
5% of the Registrant's outstanding stock after giving effect
to the issuance thereof. The Registrant has the option to
fund all or a portion of the purchases with cash which it would 
intend to borrow under its credit facility. The unaudited 
pro forma consolidated statements of operations give effect to the Crowley
Transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 1993, and the
unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the
Crowley Transaction as if it had occurred on June 30, 1994.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information does not
reflect the Registrant's exchange of the Hagerstown, MD MSA
for the PA-10 East RSA or the acquisition of the Altoona, PA
MSA prior to the consummation of these transactions in April
1994. The pending acquisitions of the ME-4 RSA and WV-1 East
RSA are also excluded.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information has been prepared by the Registrant based upon the
historical financial statements of the Registrant and CCTB.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information
gives effect to the acquisition under the purchase method of
accounting and to certain assumptions and adjustments
described more fully in the accompanying notes. This
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information may not be
indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if
the transactions had been completed on the dates indicated or
of the results which may be obtained in the future. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto for the Registrant included in its Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1993 and the Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 1994 and financial statements and notes thereto
of CCTB included elsewhere in this Form 8-K.

VANGUARD CELLULAR SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION

For purposes of determining the pro forma effects on the
consolidated statement of operations for the year
ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended June 30,
1994, the pro forma adjustments and eliminations have been
made as if the Crowley Transaction had occurred on January 1,
1993. For the purposes of determining the pro forma effects
on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,
1994, the pro forma adjustments and eliminations have been
made as if the Crowley Transaction had occurred on June 30,
1994. The following pro forma adjustments have been made:

(1) These amounts reflect the historical data of CCTB as of
or for the periods indicated, reclassified to conform
with the presentation of the Registrant's financial
statements.

(2) This adjustment reflects additional amortization of
deferred cellular license acquisition costs and the
acquired customer base arising from the acquisition of
CCTB. The deferred cellular license acquisition costs
are being amortized over 40 years in accordance with the
Registrant's policy. The cost of the acquired customer
base is being amortized over the expected service period
for these customers which is estimated to be
approximately 4 years.

(3) This adjustment reflects interest expense attributable to
the $14.2 million of borrowings that would have been
necessary to consummate the acquisition on January 1,
1993. Borrowings would have been necessary because of
the limitation on the issuance of stock described in Note
5. The adjustment assumes the borrowings would be funded
from the Facility B Loan of the Registrant's credit
agreement and would bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate
plus 2.5%. For the year ended December 31, 1993 and for
the six months ended June 30, 1994, the average
Eurodollar rate was 3.32% and 4.02%, respectively. This
additional interest expense is offset by a reduction in
the commitment fee equal to .5% of the borrowings. If
the assumed rate varied by 1/8% in each period,
consolidated interest expense for the year ended
December 31, 1993 and for the six months ended June 30,
1994, would have varied by approximately $289,000 and
$177,000, respectively.

(4) This adjustment eliminates interest expense incurred by
CCTB during the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six
months ended June 30, 1994 of $578,000 and $274,000,
respectively. This interest expense relates to long-term
debt which will be retired prior to the Crowley
Transaction.

17

<PAGE>

(5) The pro forma net loss per share is computed based on the
weighted average shares outstanding adjusted for the
additional shares issued to fund the Crowley Transaction.
The number of shares issued is based on the purchase
price of the transaction divided by the average closing
prices of the Registrant's Class A Common Stock on the
five trading days ending on the trading day immediately
preceding the assumed closing date of January 1, 1993.
However, the shares to be issued are limited to 5% of the
total outstanding shares after consummation of the
transaction. Accordingly, at January 1, 1993, 1,990,000
shares of Class A Common Stock are assumed to be issued
with the remaining $14.2 million to be funded with
borrowings from the Registrant's facility.

(6) Reflects 3 for 2 stock split effected in the form of
a 50% stock dividend paid on August 24, 1994.

(7) This adjustment reflects the settlement of "due from
affiliate" of CCTB which will be settled prior to the
consummation of the Crowley Transaction.

(8) These adjustments reflect the consummation of the Crowley
Transaction, the allocation of the purchase price and the
consolidation of CCTB as if the acquisition had occurred
on June 30, 1994.

(9) This adjustment reflects additional borrowings of
$2.2 million under the Registrant's credit facility
incurred to partially fund the Crowley Transaction.
Additionally, this adjustment also reflects the
retirement of $10.0 million of CCTB long-term debt
(including current portion) which will occur prior to the
consummation of the Crowley Transaction.

(10) This adjustment reflects the issuance of the Registrant's
Class A Common Stock to partially fund the Crowley
Transaction. The number of shares issued is based on the
purchase price of the transaction divided by the average
closing prices of the Registrant's Class A Common Stock
on the five trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the assumed closing date of
June 30, 1994. However, the shares to be issued are
limited to 5% of the total outstanding shares after
consummation of the transaction. Accordingly, at
June 30, 1994, 2,029,000 shares of Class A Common Stock
are assumed to be issued with the remaining $2.2 million
to be funded with borrowings from the Registrant's credit
facility.

Statement") free and clear of any restrictions under the
Securities Act except for prospectus delivery requirements; (2)
such shares are listed on the NASDAQ-NMS or on a national
securities exchange, if such exchange is the principal market on
which the Stock is traded; and (3) the delivery of such shares to
Seller is qualified under applicable state securities laws and
the resale of such shares by Seller shall have been qualified

or become subject to taxation in, any jurisdiction in which it
shall not be then qualified, or to file any general consent to

(ii) From time to time during the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending upon the earlier of (x) 120 days
after the Closing Date, or (y) such time as Seller shall have
advised Buyer in writing that it has completed its resale of the

(A) Prepare and deliver to Seller as many copies

512(g) of Regulation S-K) so far as is necessary to permit the
continuance of sales of Stock by Seller to the public free and
clear of any restrictions under the Securities Act except for
prospectus delivery requirements. If, at any time during the
Resale Period, an event shall occur which makes it necessary to
amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with law or with the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"), Buyer shall forthwith notify Seller of the proposed
amendment or supplement and prepare and furnish to Seller such
number of copies 
-9-

<PAGE>

of an amended or supplemented Prospectus that
complies with law and with such rules and regulations as Seller
may reasonably request. Seller shall suspend its sales of Stock
pending preparation and delivery of such amendment or supplement
and the Resale Period shall be extended by the time during which
such sales of Stock shall be suspended. Buyer authorizes Seller,
and any brokers or dealers effecting sales of the Stock for the

in accordance with applicable provisions of the Securities Act
and state securities laws. For purposes of this Agreement, the

(II) of any request made by the SEC for any amendment of or
supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for
additional information relating thereto; (III) of any suspension
or threatened suspension of the use of any Prospectus in any
state; and (IV) of any proceedings commenced or threatened to be
commenced by the SEC or any state securities commission which
would result in the issuance of any stop order or other order or
suspension of use. Buyer agrees to use its best efforts to
prevent or promptly remove any stop order or other order
preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus during the
Resale Period and to comply with any such request by the SEC to
amend or supplement the Prospectus. The Resale Period shall be
extended by the aggregate time during which sales of Stock are
suspended as a result of any stop order or other order or
suspension of use of the Prospectus.

(D) Take such action as shall be necessary to
qualify and maintain the qualification of the shares of Stock
covered by such registration under such state securities laws for
offers and sales to the public during the Resale Period as Seller
shall reasonably request; provided, however, that Buyer shall not
be obligated to qualify as a foreign corporation to do business
under the laws of or become subject to taxation in, any
jurisdiction in which it shall not be then qualified, or to file
any general consent to service of process.

(E) Cause the Stock to be registered pursuant to
Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and continually
listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the NASDAQ-NMS or a
national securities exchange, if such exchange is the principal
market on which the Stock is traded, and not subject to any
restriction or suspension from trading on the NASDAQ-NMS or such
national 
-10-
<PAGE>

securities exchange; provided, however, that Buyer may
deregister the Stock registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or
12(g) of the Exchange Act if such deregistration is in connection
with a merger, dissolution or other transaction in which the
shareholders of Buyer receive prior to such deregistration either
cash or securities that are listed on the NASDAQ-NMS or a
national securities exchange or some combination of cash and such
securities; provided, further, that Buyer may delist the Stock
from trading on the NASDAQ-NMS or national securities exchange if
Buyer is concurrently listing such stock on the New York Stock
Exchange or the American Stock Exchange.

(iii) If Buyer elects to pay a portion of the
Purchase Price in accordance with subsection (a) above with
shares of Stock, then Buyer shall make generally available to its
security holders (and deliver to Seller), in the manner
contemplated by Rule 158(b) under the Securities Act or
otherwise, as soon as practicable but in any event not later than
120 days after the end of its fiscal quarter in which the first
anniversary date of the Closing Date occurs if the end of such
fiscal quarter is the end of Buyer's fiscal year (and if the end
of such fiscal quarter is not the end of Buyer's fiscal year,
then such period shall be reduced to 50 days), an earnings
statement satisfying the requirements of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and covering a period of at least twelve (12)
consecutive months beginning after the Closing Date.

(iv) (A) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller, ECLP, KCLP, and all partners of ECLP and KCLP
against and in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several (including legal or other fees and
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or
liability) to which Seller or any of them may become subject
under the Securities Act or otherwise insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions with respect thereto)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, except to the extent that any such untrue
statement or omission is based upon written information supplied
by Seller or by any of its representatives for use in such
Registration Statement; provided, however, this indemnity
agreement shall not inure to the benefit of Seller, ECLP, KCLP,
or the partners of ECLP and KCLP on account of any loss, claim,
damage, liability or action arising from the sale of Stock to any
person as a result of Seller's failure to send or give a copy of
the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) to such person. 

(B) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyer, its officers and its directors and any
controlling 
-11-
<PAGE>

persons of Buyer against and in respect of any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several
(including legal or other fees and expenses reasonably incurred
by any of them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage or liability) to which Buyer or any such
persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions with respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent
that any such untrue statement or omission is based upon written
information supplied by Seller or its representatives for use in
such Registration Statement.

(C) The indemnification obligations of the
parties hereunder shall be subject to Section 12.4 hereof and,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, shall
survive indefinitely and shall not be subject to the
indemnification set forth in Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 hereof.
These obligations each are the consideration of the other and
shall apply whether or not the party to be indemnified is in
breach of this Agreement (other than a breach of the indemnity
under this Section).

(D) If for any reason the indemnification
provided for in the preceding clauses is unavailable to an
indemnified party as contemplated by the preceding clauses, then
the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim,
damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only the relative benefits received by the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party, but also the
relative fault of the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if Seller shall have failed to provide all information
to Buyer required to be included in the Registration Statement as
to Seller within five (5) Business Days of request by Buyer or
such later date, not later than sixty (60) days prior to the
Closing Date, as is sufficient to enable the condition in
subsection (b)(i) to be satisfied prior to the Closing, then (A)
subsection (b)(i) shall not be a condition precedent to Buyer's
right to deliver Stock in partial payment of the Purchase Price
and (B) Buyer's obligations under subsection (b)(ii) shall be
suspended until the period beginning sixty (60) days from the
date all such information is delivered to Buyer and thereafter
shall continue in force until the end of the Resale Period. If
Seller desires that any Stock that may be delivered at Closing be
registered for resale under the Securities Act by its partners,
or partners thereof, rather than 

-12-
<PAGE>

Seller, then Seller shall so
notify Buyer in writing and provide in such notification the
names and addresses of such partners (the "Designated Partners").
If Seller so notifies Buyer, then each Designated Partner shall
be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of
Seller under this subsection (b) and otherwise treated as Seller
for all purposes of this subsection (b) as to the shares of Stock
registered for the account of such Designated Partner.

(vi) If Seller sells shares of Stock delivered in
partial payment of the Purchase Price within the Resale Period
and the average net sales price per share of all shares sold
(after deduction of brokerage commissions or discounts) (the
"Average Net Sales Price") is less than the Stock Valuation
Price, the Buyer will pay to Seller an amount equal to:

(A) if the closing sales price of the Stock on the
first trading day after the Closing Date (the "Day After Closing
Price") is equal to or less than the Average Net Sales Price,
100% of the product of (x) the number of shares of Stock sold
within the Resale Period times (y) the difference between the
Stock Valuation Price and the Average Net Sales Price;

(B) if the Day After Closing Price is greater than
the Average Net Sales Price but less than the Stock Valuation
Price, 100% of the product of (x) the number of shares of Stock
sold within the Resale Period times (y) the difference between
the Stock Valuation Price and the Day After Closing Price; plus
80% of the product of (x) the number of shares of Stock sold
within the Resale Period times (y) the difference between the Day
After Closing Price and the Average Net Sales Price; or

(C) if the Day After Closing Price is equal to or
greater than the Stock Valuation Price, or if Seller sells any
shares of Stock prior to the commencement of the second trading
day after the Closing Date, 80% of the product of (x) the number
of shares of Stock sold within the Resale Period times (y) the
difference between the Stock Valuation Price and the Average Net
Sales Price.

Any payments pursuant to the foregoing shall be made in cash
within five (5) Business Days following the end of the Resale
Period. In order to be entitled to receive such payment, Seller
must deliver to the General Counsel of Buyer evidence of the sale
or sales of Stock reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, including a
copy of the brokers' confirmation statements, within two (2)
Business Days following the end of the Resale Period. Buyer
shall not be obligated to make any payment to Seller if the
Average Net Sales Price is greater than the Stock Valuation
Price.

(vii) All sales of Stock by Seller will be effected in
a reasonable and prudent manner by Seller. Sales that meet the

-13-
<PAGE>

following shall be deemed to be "reasonable and prudent" for
purposes of this Section: payment of commissions, discounts or
other adjustments to price no greater than those customary in
transactions of similar size and nature and that are part of
transactions that do not involve side or other agreements with
marketmakers that differ from arrangements in which such
marketmakers normally engage. Any purchase or sale by Seller or
any Designated Partner of puts, calls, straddles or any similar
strategy recognized in the investment community that is legal and
to which Buyer consents, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, relating to the Stock during the period from the fourth
day prior to the Closing Date and any time thereafter shall not
cause any sales of Stock by Seller to be considered effected in
any manner other than the reasonable and prudent manner required
by this paragraph.

2.4 Adjustments to Purchase Price.

(a) Capital Expenditures. The Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount, if any, necessary to reimburse Seller for
Seller's capital expenditures ("Capital Expenditures") incurred
since the Balance Sheet Date in accordance with Seller's
1994/1995 capital expenditure budget (the "Capital Budget"),
which Capital Budget is contained in Seller's Disclosure
Schedule, provided the documentation specified below is provided
to Buyer and any amounts in excess of the Capital Budget are
approved, if necessary, as set forth below. Seller and Buyer
acknowledge that Seller's actual Capital Expenditures may vary
from the Capital Budget. In the event the Capital Expenditures
vary from the attached Capital Budget by ten percent (10%) or
less, Seller shall not be required to obtain the approval of
Buyer. In the event Seller's actual Capital Expenditures in the
aggregate will vary from the Capital Expenditures Budget by more
than ten percent (10%), Seller shall obtain the prior written
approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Within forty-five (45) days of the last day of each
month from the date hereof until the Closing (and on or prior to
the Closing Date with respect to Capital Expenditures incurred
since the beginning of the month in which the Closing occurs),
Seller will provide Buyer with statements of Capital Expenditures
incurred during the previous month (or, if applicable, the month
in which Closing occurs) along with reasonable back-up
documentation demonstrating that such expenditures were actually
incurred. 

(b) Net Current Assets. The Purchase Price shall be
increased by the extent to which Net Current Assets as of the
Closing Date exceed Net Current Assets as reflected on the April
30, 1994 balance sheet of Seller, or decreased by the extent to
which Net Current Assets as of the Closing Date fall short of Net
Current Assets as reflected on the April 30, 1994 balance sheet
of Seller (the "Net Current Asset Payment"). The parties agree
that the Net Current Assets on April 30, 1994 were $598,512.38
An 
-14-
<PAGE>

estimated Net Current Asset Payment will be made at Closing
based upon a pro-forma balance sheet prepared by Seller as of the
Closing Date, which Seller shall use its best efforts to
estimate, prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied throughout the periods
covered thereby (the "Pro-forma Closing Balance Sheet"). The
actual Net Current Asset Payment will be determined pursuant to
Section 2.4(c). 

(c) Net Current Asset Payment. (i) At least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will provide
Buyer with the Pro-forma Closing Balance Sheet and a calculation
of the estimated Net Current Asset Payment, which estimate,
unless otherwise agreed, shall in no event exceed the Net Current
Assets as of the then most recent month end for which a balance
sheet has been prepared by Seller in good faith on a basis
consistent with prior periods. The line items set forth in the
April 30, 1994 balance sheet, the Pro-forma Closing Balance Sheet
and the closing balance sheet contained in the Closing Financial
Statements (the "Closing Balance Sheet") will be the same for
purposes of the Net Current Asset Payment calculation. It is the
intention of the parties that the balance sheets will be as
similarly constituted as possible. For example, if a line item
for Seller's prepaid legal fees is excluded on the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Pro-forma Closing Balance Sheet, it will
also be excluded on the April 30, 1994 balance sheet for purposes
of the Net Current Asset Payment calculation. Additionally, any
current Liabilities that will be the responsibility of Seller to
satisfy (e.g. pro rated Taxes) will be excluded for purposes of
the Net Current Asset calculation.

(ii) Pursuant to Section 11.2, within 45 days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer the Closing
Financial Statements, which shall include a calculation in
reasonable detail of the actual Net Current Asset Payment (the
"Tentative Net Current Asset Payment"). Subject to Section
2.4(c)(iii) and (iv) below, within ten (10) days after Seller's
delivery of such Closing Financial Statements to Buyer, Buyer or
Seller, as appropriate, shall pay the difference between the
estimated Net Current Asset Payment and the Tentative Net Current
Asset Payment in cash to the other party.

(iii) If Buyer reasonably believes that the Tentative
Net Current Asset Payment is incorrect, Buyer shall promptly
inform Seller of the disputed amount and the basis for the
Buyer's dispute in reasonable detail. If Seller and Buyer do not
agree on the amount of the Tentative Net Current Asset Payment
within ten (10) days thereafter, Seller and Buyer, at Buyer's
cost, shall submit such dispute to Arthur Andersen & Co. for its
independent calculation of the Net Current Asset Payment. The
parties will request that Arthur Andersen & Co. provide its
findings to the parties within forty-five (45) days after
submission of the dispute to Arthur Andersen & Co. The parties
will have ten (10) days to solve any dispute they have with
Arthur Andersen & Co.'s findings. 

-15-
<PAGE>

At the end of such ten (10)
day period, Arthur Andersen & Co. will provide the parties with
its final decision, which decision shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. Within ten (10) days after receipt of
such final decision, Buyer or Seller, as appropriate,shall pay
the difference between the estimated Net Current Asset Payment
and the Tentative Net Current Asset Payment in cash to the other
party.

(d) Credit. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by Two
Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($275,000.00), representing
satisfaction of a credit due to Buyer pursuant to the terms of
Section 5 of the Settlement Agreement. Buyer and Seller
acknowledge that the foregoing credit shall be deemed to be
complete satisfaction of any credit due pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement.

(e) Incentive Compensation Payment. The Purchase Price
shall be increased by an amount equal to the Incentive
Compensation Payment, as defined in Annex 2, which amount shall
be payable as set forth in Annex 2.

(f) Tax And Other Pro Rations. All Taxes and other
assessments on the Assets shall be pro rated between Buyer and
Seller as of the Closing Date and any pro rations chargeable to
Seller shall reduce the Purchase Price.

SECTION 3. ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS; ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

3.1 Assumption of Obligations. Buyer shall assume and
undertake to pay, satisfy or discharge (a) the current
Liabilities (but not including the current portion of long term
liabilities including accrued interest thereon) of Seller on and

commitments of Seller arising on or after the Closing Date under:
(i) the Contracts listed with an asterisk in Seller's Disclosure
Schedule; (ii) the Subscriber Agreements; (iii) any accounts
payable of Seller outstanding at Closing (excluding any interest
and penalties resulting from any such payables being overdue), if
any, which represent reimbursable Capital Expenditures pursuant
to Section 2.4(a) above; and (iv) all contracts and commitments
approved in writing by Buyer after the date of this Agreement as
contemplated by Section 6.1(b)(iii) below. Buyer shall also be
responsible for all Liabilities arising from the ownership and
use of the Assets and the operation of the System on and after
the Closing Date. 

3.2 Limitation. Except as set forth in Section 3.1
hereof, Buyer shall not assume, or otherwise be responsible for,
any liabilities or obligations of Seller, whether actual or
contingent, matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, or
known or unknown, whether arising out of occurrences prior to, at
or after the date hereof, which include, without limitation:

-16-

Schedule, any liability or obligation to or in respect of any
employees or former employees of Seller including without
limitation (i) any employment agreement, whether or not written,
between Seller and any person, (ii) any liability under any
Employee Plan at any time maintained, contributed to or required
to be contributed to by or with respect to Seller or under which
Seller may incur liability, or any contributions, benefits or
liabilities therefor, or any liability with respect to Seller's
withdrawal or partial withdrawal from or termination of any
Employee Plan and (iii) any claim of an unfair labor practice, or
any claim under any state unemployment compensation or worker's
compensation law or regulation or under any federal or state

or omissions which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date;

(b) Any liability or obligation of Seller in respect
of any Taxes;

(c) Any liability arising from any injury to or death
of any person or damage to or destruction of any property,

liability, enterprise liability or any other legal or equitable
theory arising from defects in products manufactured or from
services performed by or on behalf of Seller or in connection
with the operation of the System on or prior to the Closing Date;

(d) Any liability or obligation of Seller arising out
of or related to any action against Seller or any action which
adversely affects the Assets and which shall have been asserted
on or prior to the Closing Date or to the extent the basis of
which shall have arisen on or prior to the Closing Date;

(e) Any liability or obligation of Seller resulting
from entering into, performing its obligations pursuant to or

Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that, except as set
forth in Seller's Disclosure Schedule: 

4.1 Authority. Seller is a general partnership, duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Maryland and is duly qualified to conduct
business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the extent such
qualification is required. Seller's general partners are KCLP
and ECLP. Seller has the requisite power and authority required

documents contemplated 

-17-
<PAGE>

thereby according to their respective
terms. Seller is not a participant in any joint venture or
partnership with any other Person relating to the System. 

4.2 Authorization and Binding Obligation. Seller has
taken all partnership action necessary to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly
executed by Seller and constitutes a legal, valid, and binding

with its terms, except for the effect thereon of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each agreement
executed by Seller in connection with the Closing will be duly
executed and delivered by Seller and will constitute a legal,
valid, and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against
Seller in accordance with its terms, except for the effect
thereon of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally. 

4.3 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the
Balance Sheet Date there has not been any:

(a) change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Assets, Liabilities, working capital, reserves, earnings,
business or prospects of Seller, or the System except for changes
contemplated hereby or changes which have not, individually or in
the aggregate, been material and adverse;

(b) (i) material increase in compensation payable or to
become payable to any of the employees of Seller or any bonus
payment made or promised to any such employee other than in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices,
or (ii) material change in personnel policies, insurance,
retirement, health or other employee benefits or any other
compensation arrangements affecting such employees other than in
the ordinary course of business;

(c) amendment, cancellation or termination of any

reinstated prior to Closing, or terminations of non-material
licenses, in the ordinary course of business);

(d) change in accounting methods or practices by
Seller;

(e) revaluation by Seller of any of the Assets, except
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice;

(f) amendment of Seller's General Partnership Agreement
which adversely affects the System or the Assets or the ability
of Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement; or

-18-
<PAGE>

(g) agreement (whether written or oral) by Seller to do
any of the foregoing.

4.4 Sufficiency of Assets. The Assets constitute all of
the assets, rights and properties, tangible or intangible, real
or personal used in the operation of the System as it is
presently conducted and as at the Balance Sheet Date (other than
deletions in the ordinary course of business when replaced by
assets of substantially equivalent value and function).

4.5 No Conflict or Violation. The execution, delivery, and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the documents
contemplated hereby and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby: (a) will not conflict with any provision of
Seller's General Partnership Agreement; (b) will not conflict
with or constitute a violation of any applicable statute, law,
rule, code, judgment, order, ordinance, writ, injunction,
regulation, decree, award or ruling of any court or other
governmental instrumentality or result in an event which with
notice, lapse of time or both, would result in any such conflict
or violation; and (c) provided the Consents are obtained, will
not conflict with, constitute grounds for termination of, result
in a breach of, constitute a default under, or accelerate or
permit the acceleration of any performance required by the terms
of any Contract, Governmental Authorization, or other agreement,
instrument, license, or permit to which Seller is a party or by
which Seller is bound or subject, or result in an event which
with notice, lapse of time or both, would result in any such
conflict, grounds, breach, default, or acceleration. 

4.6 Consents. No consent, approval, permit, or
authorization of, declaration to or filing or registration with
any governmental or regulatory authority or any other Party
(including without limitation any Consent necessary for the valid
assignment of any Contract) is required to be made or obtained in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Seller and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including enabling Buyer to own the Assets and operate the
System.

4.7 Governmental Authorizations. Seller's Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and complete list of the Governmental
Authorizations. Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete
copies of the Governmental Authorizations. Each Governmental
Authorization has been validly issued to Seller. The
Governmental Authorizations comprise all the licenses, permits,
and other authorizations required from governmental and
regulatory authorities for the lawful conduct of the operation of
the System. The Governmental Authorizations are in full force
and effect and are unimpaired by any acts or omissions of Seller,
and are valid for the balance of the current license term, if
any, applicable generally to each such Governmental
Authorization. The operation of the System is in compliance with
the Governmental 

-19-
<PAGE>

Authorizations. Seller has no reason to believe
that any of the Governmental Authorizations would not be renewed
by the granting authority in the ordinary course if Seller were
the applicant. Seller is the exclusive holder of the FCC
Authorizations. To the knowledge of Seller, there are no pending
or threatened proceedings by or before the FCC which would result
in the revocation, cancellation, suspension or adverse
modification of the FCC Authorizations, nor to Seller's knowledge
are there any facts that would give rise to or form the basis for
such a proceeding. Assuming all Consents are obtained, Seller
has the right, power and authority under the Communications Act
to transfer the Assets to Buyer upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. No renewal of any FCC Authorization would
constitute a major environmental action under the current Rules
of the FCC. The FCC actions granting the current FCC
Authorizations together with all underlying construction permits,
are Final Orders of the FCC. Seller is not aware of any reason
why (i) those of the FCC Authorizations subject to expiration
would not be renewed in the ordinary course of business if Seller
were the applicant or (ii) any of the FCC authorizations would be
revoked. The initial FCC Form 489 to commence operation of the
System was filed with the FCC on December 6, 1991. None of the
Governmental Authorizations is subject to any Encumbrance, other
than any liens securing Seller Indebtedness, all of which liens
shall be extinguished by Seller prior to or at Closing.

4.8 Seller Qualifications. Seller is legally, technically,
financially and otherwise qualified to hold the FCC
Authorizations and upon obtaining the FCC Consents will be so
qualified to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.9 Real Property. Seller's Disclosure Schedule contains
a complete description of all of Seller's interests and rights in
Real Property used or intended for use in connection with the
operation of the System. Seller leases all of its Real Property,
all of which leases are identified in Seller's Disclosure
Schedule (the "Real Property Leases"). Each Cell Site that is
part of the Assets is the subject of a Real Property Lease. To
the knowledge of Seller, there are no pending or threatened
condemnation proceedings relating to any of the Real Property.
All improvements included in the Real Property are in good
operating condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted) with no
known material defects. To the knowledge of Seller, no
improvements on any Real Property encroach upon adjoining real
estate, and all such improvements are constructed in conformity
with all "setback" lines, easements, and other restrictions, or
rights of record, that have been established by any applicable
building or safety codes or zoning ordinances. To the knowledge
of Seller, no utility lines serving the System pass over the
lands of others except where appropriate easements have been
obtained. All towers and other structures on the Real Property
are marked in accordance with the requirements of the FCC
Authorizations, the Federal Aviation Administration and all

-20-

<PAGE>
applicable state and local laws. Seller has no knowledge of any
written notice for assessments for public improvements against
any Real Property which remains unpaid. Seller has not granted
any oral or written lease, sublease or license granting to any
Person any right to the possession, use, occupancy or enjoyment
of any of the Real Property. All Real Property is supplied with
utilities (including without limitation water, sewage, disposal,
electricity, gas and telephone) and other services necessary for
the operation of such Real Property as currently operated. None
of the Real Property is subject to any Encumbrance that could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the use
or usefulness of the Real Property, other than any liens securing
Seller Indebtedness, all of which liens shall be extinguished by
Seller prior to or at Closing. Other than any liens securing
Seller Indebtedness, Seller is not aware of any potential claim
or Encumbrance that could reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect the use or usefulness of the Real Property.
Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of all
Real Property Leases. Seller has full legal and practical access
to all Real Property. All easements, rights of way, and real
property licenses relating to the Real Property Leases have been
properly recorded in the appropriate public recording offices, to
the extent required by law. 

4.10 Personal Property. Without material exception,
Seller's Disclosure Schedule contains descriptions of all
Seller's fixed assets which are part of its Personal Property.
Seller owns and has good and marketable title to each item of
Personal Property, except for the Personal Property that is
specifically identified in Seller's Disclosure Schedule as leased
pursuant to one of the Contracts. None of the Personal Property
is subject to any Encumbrance, except for any liens securing
Seller Indebtedness, all of which shall be extinguished by Seller
prior to or at Closing. All of the Personal Property is in good
operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted),
and is available for immediate use in the operation of the
System. The Personal Property is sufficient to permit the System
to operate in all material respects in accordance with the terms
of the FCC Authorizations.

4.11 Subscribers and Suppliers. Copies of all Subscriber
Agreements are contained in Seller's Books and Records. As of
the Balance Sheet Date, Seller had approximately 5,082 subscriber
accounts, each telephone number being a separate account. Seller
has not entered into any Subscriber Agreements outside the
ordinary course of business or for consideration other than cash.
To Seller's knowledge, none of its material Subscribers or
suppliers has threatened to terminate or change in a material way
its relationship with Seller.

4.12 Resale and Roaming Agreements. Seller is not a party
to any Resale Agreements. Seller's Disclosure Schedule contains

4.13 Financial Statements. The Financial Statements are
contained in Seller's Disclosure Schedule. The Financial
Statements do and will, as appropriate, and the Closing Financial
Statement will, fairly present the Assets, Liabilities and
financial condition and results of the System's operations
indicated in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied, subject to normal year-end
adjustments in the case of any interim financial statements.

4.14 Contracts. The Contracts listed in Seller's Disclosure
Schedule comprise all Seller's Contracts (including Real Property
Leases). Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies
of all such Contracts, together will all amendments and
extensions to date. All such Contracts are in full force and
effect, are valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with
their terms, except for the effect thereon of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally in respect only
to the parties contracting with Seller, are paid currently, and
have not been materially impaired by any acts or omissions of
Seller. No material Contract requires the consent of any other
contracting party to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Seller is not in material default under any Contract.
To Seller's knowledge, no other party is in material default
under any Contract identified with an asterisk in Seller's
Disclosure Schedule. Seller is not aware of any intent by any
party to any Contract to terminate or amend the terms thereof, to
refuse to renew the Contract upon expiration of its term, or to
renew the Contract upon expiration only on terms and conditions
that could be less advantageous to the System than those
currently pertaining. No Contract contains any unfulfilled
requirement that Seller incur capital or other expenses.

4.15 Seller Indebtedness. Seller's Disclosure Schedule
contains a true and complete list of all agreements relating to
any Seller Indebtedness and any other indebtedness of Seller
relating to the System. Seller has delivered to Buyer true and
complete copies of all such agreements and evidences of

Intangibles. None of the Intangibles is subject to any

all of which liens shall be

<PAGE>

extinguished by Seller prior to or at
Closing. Seller has delivered to Buyer copies of all documents
establishing the Intangibles to the extent material to Seller's
business and the balance thereof is, and at Closing will be, on
the Real Property. To the best of Seller's knowledge, Seller is
not infringing upon any trademarks, trade names, copyrights,
patents, patent applications, know-how, methods, or processes
owned by any other Person or Persons, and there is no claim or
action pending, or to the best knowledge of Seller, threatened
with respect thereto. No Person has a right to receive a royalty
or similar payment in respect of any Intangibles.

4.17 Taxes. 

(a) Filing of Tax Returns. Seller has filed with the
appropriate taxing authorities all returns (including without
limitation information returns and other material information) in
respect to all taxes and other assessments and levies (including
all interest and penalties), in respect of Taxes required to be

governmental authority against Seller. There are no pending or,
to Seller's knowledge, threatened audits, investigations or
claims for or relating to any material additional liability in
respect of Taxes, and there are no matters under discussion with
any governmental authorities with respect to Taxes that in the
reasonable judgment of Seller, or its counsel, is likely to
result in a material additional liability for Taxes for which
Buyer may be liable or which is likely to result in any
Encumbrance on the Assets. Audits of federal, state, and local
returns for Taxes by the relevant taxing authorities which have
been completed for any period are set forth on Seller's
Disclosure Schedule and, except as set forth Seller's Disclosure

delivered to Buyer true and correct copies of any employment
agreements (the "Employment 

-24-
<PAGE>

Agreements") relating to its
employees. Seller (i) is not a party to any labor agreement with
respect to its employees with any labor organization, group or
association, and (ii) has not been notified at any time during
the past three years of any attempt by organized labor or its
representatives to make Seller conform to demands of organized
labor relating to its employees or to enter into a binding
agreement with organized labor that would cover the employees of
Seller. There is no unfair labor practice charge, complaint or
grievance against Seller pending before the National Labor
Relations Board or any other governmental agency arising out of
Seller's activities, and to the best of Seller's knowledge, there
are no facts or information that would give rise thereto. There
is no labor strike or labor disturbance pending, or the best
knowledge of Seller, threatened against it.

4.20 Employee Benefit Plans. All Employee Plans that cover
or have covered employees of Seller are set forth in Seller's
Disclosure Schedule. All Employee Plans maintained by Seller
conform in all material respects when applicable with the
provisions of ERISA and have been administered in substantial
compliance with the terms of such plans and with all filing,
reporting and disclosure requirements of the Code and ERISA when
applicable. There is no pending or threatened litigation, claim
or assessment against any such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan
that is a "Pension Plan" is qualified under Section 4001 of the
Code. Seller has never maintained or sponsored, or been required
to contribute to, or withdrawn from, any Multi-employer Plan.
Seller has not been subject to any "withdrawal liability" (as
defined in Section 4201 of ERISA) at any time assessed against
Seller with respect to any Multi-employer Plan. Seller has
maintained all Employee Plans with respect to its employees in a
manner that will not give rise to any successor liability to
Buyer under ERISA or the Code. 

4.21 Transactions with Certain Persons. No partner or
employee of Seller, or any member of any such Person's immediate
family, is presently a party to any material transaction with
Seller relating to the System, including without limitation, any
contract, agreement or other arrangement (i) providing for the
furnishing of material services by or to, (ii) providing for the
rental of material real or personal property from or to, or (iii)
otherwise requiring material payments to (other than for services
as partners or employees of Seller) any such Person or any
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any such
Person has a substantial interest as a shareholder, officer,
director, trustee or partner.

4.22 Litigation. Seller is not subject to any judgment,
award, order, writ, injunction, arbitration decision or decree
which adversely affects the conduct of the business of the System
or the Assets or which could materially adversely affect Seller's
ability to perform its obligations hereunder. There is no

-25-

litigation, proceeding or investigation pending or, to Seller's
knowledge, threatened against Seller or relating to the business
or operations of the System in any federal, state or local court,
or before any administrative agency or arbitrator or before any
other tribunal duly authorized to resolve disputes, which could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the
business, property, Assets or condition (financial or otherwise)
of the System or which seeks to enjoin or prohibit, or otherwise

pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or which could
materially adversely affect Seller's ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. 

4.23 Compliance With Laws. Seller has not received any
notice asserting any noncompliance by it in connection with the
business or operation of the System with any applicable statute,
rule or regulation, whether federal, state or local. Seller is

decree of any court, administrative agency or other Governmental
Authority or any other tribunal duly authorized to resolve
disputes in any respect material to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Seller is in compliance with all laws, regulations and
governmental orders applicable to the Assets and the conduct of
the business and operations of the System, the failure to comply
with which could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of the System. 

4.24 Bankruptcy. No insolvency proceedings of any
character, including without limitation, bankruptcy,
receivership, reorganization, composition or arrangement with
creditors, voluntary or involuntary, affecting Seller (other than
as a creditor) or any of the Assets, are pending, or to Seller's
knowledge, threatened, and Seller has not made any assignment for
the benefit of creditors or taken any action in contemplation of
or which would constitute the basis for the institution of such
insolvency proceedings. 

4.25 Environmental and Safety Compliance. Neither the
operation of the business of the System nor the Assets violate in
any material respect any applicable federal, state or local law,
rule, regulation or order relating to air, water or noise
pollution, employee health and safety, or the production,
storage, labeling, transportation or disposition of waste or
hazardous or toxic substances (collectively, "Environmental
Laws"). Seller has timely obtained all licenses and permits and
timely filed all reports required to be filed under any
applicable Environmental Laws, such licenses and permits being
listed in Seller's Disclosure Schedule. Seller has not, and, to
Seller's knowledge, no other Person has, stored any Pollutant on,
beneath or about any of the Real Property. Seller is not aware of
any condition relating to or resulting from the release or
discharge of Pollutants into the 

-26-

<PAGE>

soil, surface waters,
groundwater, drinking water supplies, navigable waters, land,
surface or subsurface strata, or ambient air which has resulted

Party relating to or resulting from the operation of the business
of the System, the Assets or otherwise relating to the Real
Property, irrespective of the cause of such condition. Seller
has not received any notice from any governmental authority or
private or public entity advising Seller that it is potentially
responsible for response costs with respect to a release or
threatened release of any Pollutant. Seller has not, and, to
Seller's knowledge, no other Person has, buried, dumped or
otherwise disposed of any Pollutants on, beneath or about any of
the Real Property. Seller has not received any notice of

assessments or impact statements or reports relating to the Real
Property have been prepared for, or received by, Seller prior to
the date hereof.

fees, or similar payments to any Person or entity acting on
Seller's behalf in connection with this Agreement or any matter
relating hereto.

respect thereto.

4.28 No Misstatements or Omissions. None of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in this

adverse effect on the Assets or the conduct or operation of the
business of the System. 

4.29 Books and Records. Seller has made and kept (and given
Buyer access to) the Books and Records and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the activities
of Seller. 

4.30 Accounts Receivable. The accounts receivable reflected
in the April 30, 1994 balance sheet contained in the Financial
Statements, and all accounts receivable arising since the Balance
Sheet Date, represent bona fide claims of Seller against debtors
for sales, services performed or other charges arising on or
before the date hereof, and all the goods delivered and services

performed in accordance with the applicable orders, Contracts or
customer requirements. Said accounts receivable are subject to
no defenses, counterclaims or rights of setoff and are fully
collectible in the ordinary course of Seller's business without
cost in collection efforts therefor, except to the extent of the
appropriate reserves for bad debts on accounts receivable as set
forth on the April 30, 1994 balance sheet and, in the case of
accounts receivable arising since the Balance Sheet Date, to the
extent of a reasonable reserve rate for bad debts on accounts

(c) Governmental Authorizations. Seller shall not cause or
permit, by any act or failure to act, any of the Governmental
Authorizations to expire or to be surrendered or modified, or
take any action that would cause any governmental authority to
institute proceedings for the suspension, revocation, or material
and adverse modification of any of the Governmental
Authorizations or fail to prosecute with due diligence any
pending applications for any governmental authority in connection
with the operation of the System, or take any other action within
its control that would result in the System being in

(d) Access to Information. Subject to Section 15.12
hereof, Seller shall give to Buyer and its counsel, accountants,

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied, subject to normal year-end adjustments.
Seller shall make its best efforts to provide Buyer with December
31, 1994 audited financial statements and footnotes by February
15, 1995. Seller and Buyer will cooperate in the preparation of
such year end audited financial statements, and Buyer will pay
the amount by which the cost of the audit exceeds Seller's cost
of its audit for its December 31, 1993 financial statements. The
unavailability of such audited financial statements on the
Closing Date shall not constitute a basis upon which either Buyer
or Seller may refuse to close the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(f) Maintenance of Assets. Seller shall take all actions
necessary to maintain all the Assets in good and working order
and in the condition represented in this Agreement, ordinary wear
and tear excepted, and will maintain supplies of inventory and

impairment, confiscation, or condemnation to any of the Assets
occurs, Seller shall take all actions necessary to repair,
replace, or restore the Assets to their prior condition as

material respects with all laws, rules and regulations in
connection with the Assets and the System and the matters related

necessary to satisfy the covenant set forth in the first sentence
of this subsection.

(h) Insurance. Seller shall take all action necessary to
keep in full force and effect any existing insurance policies, or
comparable coverage, for the Assets and the System as set forth

in a timely manner all federal, state, and local tax and

-33-

<PAGE>

information returns hereafter required to be filed by Seller
relating to or in connection with the Assets and the operation of
the System, and will pay all taxes (and any other charges,
duties, penalties, interest, or fines) which become due pursuant
to those returns or pursuant to any assessment which becomes due
and payable unless contested in good faith.

(k) No Shop. Neither Seller (nor any of its partners,
representatives, employees, agents or affiliates) will, directly
or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage or participate in
negotiations with respect to, or furnish or cause or permit to be

respective affiliates or their representatives) in connection
with any inquiry or offer for any purchase or sale of the System,
the Assets or any part thereof.

(l) Estoppel Certificates. Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain an estoppel certificate with respect to

conditions set forth in Section 9.2 have been satisfied, Seller
shall transfer, convey, assign, and deliver to Buyer the Assets
as provided in Section 2 and make the deliveries provided in
Section 10.2. 

SECTION 7. CLOSING COVENANTS OF BUYER. 

7.1 Pre-Closing Covenants. Buyer covenants and agrees with
Seller that between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Buyer
shall act so that each representation and warranty in Section 5
shall continue to be true on and as of the Closing Date in all
material respects as if made on and as of the Closing Date.
Buyer shall not take any action that is inconsistent with Buyer's
obligations under this Agreement or that could hinder or delay

-34-

<PAGE>

SECTION 8. SPECIAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS. 

8.1 FCC Consents. The sale of the Assets as contemplated
by this Agreement is subject to the prior consent and approval of
the FCC. Within ten (10) Business Days from the date hereof,
Buyer and Seller shall file with the FCC applications for the FCC
Consents (the "Assignment Applications"). Buyer and Seller agree
to use their best efforts to: (i) prosecute the Assignment
Applications with all reasonable diligence; (ii) amend the
Assignment Applications as may be required or desirable to
effectuate the transactions contemplated hereunder; (iii) oppose
any petition to deny or other opposition filed against the
Assignment Applications; and (iv) otherwise use their best
efforts to obtain a grant of the Assignment Applications as
expeditiously as practicable. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall
seek, nor cause any of their agents to seek, and each shall use
its best efforts to oppose, any request for reconsideration,
application for review or any other attempt to seek any form of
review of the FCC Consents. The failure by either party to
timely file or diligently prosecute its portion of the Assignment
Applications as required by this Section shall be a material
breach of this Agreement. All fees charged by the FCC in
connection with filing the Assignment Applications shall be split
between the parties.

8.2 Other Consents.

(a) Within ten (10) days of the date of this Agreement,
Seller and Buyer shall join in any applications, filings or
registrations required by any state or local governmental
regulatory authority (including, without limitation, the
Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission) to request issuance of
orders approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(if such orders are requisite to the completion of these
transactions) and they will diligently and expeditiously take all
steps reasonably necessary to prosecute any such applications.
The failure by either party to timely file or diligently
prosecute its portion of any such applications as required by
this Section shall be a material breach of this Agreement. All
filing and grant fees charged by such state regulatory authority
in connection with such applications shall be split between the
parties. 

(b) Seller shall commence, as soon as practicable, all
action reasonably necessary to obtain all other Consents, without
any material adverse change in the terms or conditions of any
Contract or Governmental Authorization that could be materially
less advantageous to the System than those pertaining under the
Contract or Governmental Authorization as in effect on the date
hereof; provided however, that Seller's failure to receive any
such Consents shall not be deemed to be a breach of this
covenant. Seller shall promptly advise Buyer of any
difficulties experienced in obtaining any of the Consents and of
any conditions proposed, considered, or requested for any of the
Consents. 

-35-
<PAGE>

8.3 Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate fully with
each other in connection with any actions required to be taken as
part of their obligations under this Agreement, and will use
their best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to fulfill their obligations hereunder. If one or
more of the Consents are not received, the parties agree to use
their best efforts to work together to find some alternative
course of action which will ameliorate to the fullest extent
possible the failure to receive the Consent; provided however,
this shall not alleviate Buyer's rights to satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Section 9.1.

8.4 HSR Filings. Within thirty (30) days of the date of
this Agreement, Buyer shall make any and all filings that the
parties determine are required under the HSR Act. All filing and
grant fees in connection with such HSR Act filings shall be paid
by Buyer.

8.5 Notification of Certain Matters. Seller and Buyer
shall each give prompt notice to the other party of (i) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or
failure would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect any time from the date hereof
to the Closing Date and (ii) any material failure of such party
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and such party
shall use all reasonable efforts to remedy the same.

8.6 Employees. Seller shall update the list of its
employees set forth in Seller's Disclosure Schedule approximately
sixty (60) days from the date hereof. Buyer will notify Seller
within ten days of receipt of such updated schedule of any
employees to whom it does not anticipate extending offers of
employment upon Closing so that Seller can give such employees
adequate notice. Seller shall terminate the employment of all of
its employees immediately prior to Closing and will pay them for
accrued, unused vacation days and Seller represents and agrees
that such termination shall be without any liability to Buyer.
It is Buyer's present stated intention that it will offer
employment to substantially all of Seller's employees on
substantially the same terms and conditions as their current
employment with Seller, subject to the standard terms and
conditions applicable to Buyer's other comparable employees.
Buyer's offers of employment shall be on terms and conditions
that Buyer shall determine in its sole discretion. Buyer will
grandfather the seniority of the employees hired for purposes of
determining vacation benefits and eligibility for Buyer's group
health insurance. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that any hired
employees will be subject to the waiting period for pre-existing
conditions under Buyer's group health insurance. Such seniority
shall be based upon the term of service with Seller only. Seller
waives any claims against Buyer or any of the employees 

-36-

<PAGE>
hired by
Buyer arising from such employment, including without limitation
any claims arising from any employment agreement or non-compete
agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon
any employee hired by Buyer any right with respect to continued
employment by Buyer, nor shall anything contained herein
interfere with the right of Buyer to terminate the employment of
any employee hired by Buyer at any time, with or without cause,
or restrict Buyer in the exercise of its independent business
judgment in establishing or modifying any of the terms and
conditions of the employment of the employees hired by Buyer. No
provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee hired by Buyer, any
beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms
and conditions of employment and benefits that may be provided to
such employee by Buyer or under any benefit plan that Buyer may
