ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On November 1, 1993, GTE South Incorporated (the Company) in a
series of transactions (the ALLTEL transaction) exchanged its
telephone plant in service, materials and supplies and customers
(representing 244,000 access lines) in the state of Georgia for
similar assets (including 38,000 access lines) in ALLTEL
Corporation's (ALLTEL) Illinois operations and $445 million in
cash.

This transaction was accounted for as a sale. The net sales
proceeds exceeded the book value of assets and liabilities sold
and therefore, a gain was recognized on the transaction.

On December 31, 1993, the Company sold its telephone plant in
service, materials and supplies and customers (representing
123,000 access lines) in the states of West Virginia and
Tennessee to Citizens Utilities Company for $291 million in cash
(the Citizens transaction). This transaction was accounted for
as a sale. The net sales proceeds exceeded book value and
therefore, a gain was recognized on the transaction.

Item 7 includes the (unaudited) Pro Forma Condensed Consolidating
Balance Sheet as of September 30, 1993 and Income Statement for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 1993 and the Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidating Statement of Income for the year ended
December 31, 1992. The income statements show the pro forma
effects of the ALLTEL and Citizens transactions as if the
transactions had taken place as of the beginning of the period.
The balance sheet shows the pro forma effects as if the
transactions took place at the balance sheet date.
