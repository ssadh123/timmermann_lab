VALLEY NATIONAL BANCORP COMPLETES MERGER WITH ROCK 
FINANCIAL CORPORATION

WAYNE, NJ--Gerald H. Lipkin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of Valley National Bancorp (NYSE:VLY), announced today the
completion of the previously announced merger with Rock Financial
Corporation, based in North Plainfield, New Jersey.

As a result of the merger, Rock shareholders received 1.85 shares
of Valley common stock for each share of Rock common stock that
they own, which translates into 1,723,423 shares of Valley common
stock or $43.1 million. Rock has 931,580 outstanding shares of
common stock.

RockBank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rock Financial Corporation,
has approximately $190 million in assets and operates five branch
offices in North Plainfield, Watchung, Green Brook, Westfield, and
South Plainfield.

In commenting on the merger, Mr. Lipkin said, "we are especially
pleased with this acquisition as RockBank is a preferred U.S. Small
Business Administrative (SBA) lender. Preferred SBA lenders can
make SBA loans without first receiving SBA approval for the
individual loan, thereby speeding the approval process."

"With the approval of Valley to succeed Rock as a preferred SBA
lender, we will be able to expand our lending to small business,
which is consistent with our corporate goal and commitment of
providing commercial loans to local entrepreneurs," Lipkin
continued.

Lipkin also noted that, "the merger with Rock is consistent with
Valley's strategy of growth within New Jersey through acquisitions
of other strong financial institutions."

The merger increases Valley National's total assets to
approximately $3.7 billion and its branch network to 63 offices in
41 communities in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris,
Passaic, Somerset, and Union counties.
