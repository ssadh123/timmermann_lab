Item 5. Other Events.

On November 7, 1994, the National Transportation Safety
Board (the "NTSB") recommended to the Federal Aviation
Administration (the "FAA") that, among other things, the FAA
restrict the operation of ATR-42 and ATR-72 turbo-propeller
aircraft in icing conditions. American Eagle carriers, which are
wholly-owned by AMR Eagle, a subsidiary of Corporation, operate
71 ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft. Although there is currently no
indication that the FAA will adopt the NTSB's recommendation, the
adoption by the FAA of the recommendation would require many of
such aircraft to be rescheduled to areas where icing conditions
are unlikely to arise or, perhaps, to be removed from scheduled
service. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on
the financial results of the Corporation and American Airlines.
