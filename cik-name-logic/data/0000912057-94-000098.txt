MINNEAPOLIS, January 13, 1994 -- First Bank System, Inc. (NYSE: FBS) today
reported fourth quarter earnings of $95.9 million, or $0.81 per share, compared
with $64.7 million, or $0.54 per share, before merger-related charges in the
fourth quarter of 1992. Return on assets and return on common equity in the
fourth quarter of 1993 were 1.45 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively,
compared with returns of 1.07 percent and 12.7 percent, before merger-related
charges in the fourth quarter of 1992.

The improvement in fourth quarter 1993 earnings over the same period in
1992 resulted principally from an increase in net interest income on a
taxable-equivalent basis of $30 million, or

11.4 percent, and a decrease in provision for credit losses of $12.3 million, or
31.3 percent, excluding 1992 merger-related charges. Net interest margin on a
taxable-equivalent basis for the quarter was 5.00 percent, or 9 basis points
higher than in the fourth quarter of 1992.

Also contributing to the strong results for the fourth quarter of 1993 was
continuing progress on achieving cost savings from the integration of recent
acquisitions. Compared with noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 1992,
including the operations of Bank Shares Incorporated (BSI) on a pro forma basis
and excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense for the quarter
declined $28.3 million, or 10 percent. The efficiency ratio, or ratio of
expenses to revenues, for the fourth quarter of 1993 improved to 58.1 percent,
from 64.6 percent for the same quarter last year, excluding merger-related
costs.

Earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 1993 reflect the impact of the
repurchase of 2.3 million average shares in anticipation of the acquisition of
Boulevard Bancorp. As previously announced, First Bank System plans to
repurchase all of the shares to be issued in the transaction, which is expected
to close early in 1994; the repurchased shares will be reissued at the closing
of the Boulevard Bancorp transaction. If these shares had been outstanding
throughout the fourth quarter of 1993, earnings for the quarter would have been
lower by $0.01 per share.

Earnings for the year 1993 totaled $348 million before merger-related
charges, an increase of $111.7 million, or 47.3 percent, from the prior year
before merger-related charges and cumulative effect of accounting changes. On a
per share basis, earnings before merger-related charges were $2.83 per share in
1993, compared with earnings of $1.96 per share before merger-related charges
and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 1992, an increase of 44.4
percent. Return on average assets before merger-related charges was 1.36
percent in 1993, compared with 1.00 percent before merger-related charges and
cumulative effect of accounting changes in 1992. On the same basis, return on
average common equity was 16.4 percent in 1993, compared with 12.0 percent last
year.

The improvement in annual earnings reflected an increase in net interest
income on a taxable-equivalent basis of $132.8 million, or 13 percent, and a
decrease in provision for credit losses of $44.6 million, or 26.3 percent,
excluding 1992 merger-related charges. Net interest margin on a
taxable-equivalent basis rose 22 basis points from 1992, to 5.07 percent.

The successful integration of recent acquisitions also contributed to the
strong results for the year. Compared with noninterest expense for 1992,
including the operations of BSI on a pro forma basis and excluding
merger-related charges, noninterest expense for the year declined $76.7 million,
or 6.9 percent. The efficiency ratio, or ratio of expenses to revenues,
excluding merger-related costs, for 1993 improved to 59.8 percent, from 64.7
percent for last year. Average full-time equivalent employees in 1993 totaled
12,300, compared with the 1992 average of 13,503 (pro forma for the BSI
acquisition).

Nonperforming assets dropped to $226 million at December 31, 1993, a
decrease of $40.8 million, or 15.3 percent, from September 30, 1993, and $186.1
million, or 45.2 percent, from the end of 1992. The ratio of the allowance for
credit losses to nonperforming loans continues to indicate strong reserve
coverage, increasing to 269 percent, from 233 percent at the end of third
quarter and 179 percent at December 31, 1992.

First Bank System's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, John
F. Grundhofer, said, "The year 1993 has been very good for First Bank System.
We substantially completed the integration of three major acquisitions, and our
noninterest expense level reflects significant cost take-outs relating to the
consolidation. We continue to make progress toward achieving our goal of an
efficiency ratio in the low-50's. We have reached the first milestone by
breaking through the 60 percent level, reducing our efficiency ratio to 58.1
percent for the fourth quarter and 59.8 percent for the year." Grundhofer
added, "We also continue to see significant improvements in credit quality, as
evidenced by our lower provision for losses, reduced net charge-offs and a

declining level of nonperforming assets. With our integration efforts largely
behind us, we are now well positioned to leverage our technology with growth in
our core businesses."

Reported net income for 1993 was $298 million ($2.39 per share), after
merger-related charges of $50 million ($0.44 per share), on an after-tax basis,
recorded in the second quarter in connection with the acquisition of Colorado
National Bankshares (CNB). Reported net income for 1992 was $311.8 million
($2.67 per share), including income related to the cumulative effect of changes
in accounting principles of $157.3 million ($1.49 per share) and merger-related
charges of $81.8 million ($0.78 per share), on an after-tax basis.

Results for 1993 and 1992 have been restated to reflect the acquisition of
CNB on May 28, 1993, which was accounted for using the pooling-of-interests
method. Earnings for 1993 include the results of BSI, which was acquired on
December 31, 1992 and accounted for using the purchase method.

In September of 1993, First Bank System announced that it had agreed to
purchase Boulevard Bancorp, Inc. of Chicago, a commercial bank holding company
with $1.7 billion in assets and $1.2 billion in deposits. In December of 1993,
First Bank System announced agreements to purchase two additional institutions.
First Financial Investors, Inc. is the holding company of St. Louis Bank for
Savings, FSB, of Duluth, Minnesota, with $200 million in assets; and United Bank
of Bismarck is located in North Dakota, with $123 million in assets. The three
acquisitions are expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the
second quarter of 1994. In January of 1994, First Bank System announced that it
has agreed to purchase the domestic corporate trust business of J.P. Morgan &
Co., Inc.; this transaction is expected to close late in the second quarter of
1994.

Fourth quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $293.3
million, an increase of $30 million, or 11.4 percent, from the fourth quarter of
1992. The improvement in net interest income reflects increases in average
earning assets of $1.9 billion, or 9.1 percent, and average noninterest-bearing
deposits of $2.2 billion, or 41.8 percent. Average earning assets totaled
$23.27 billion in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with $21.34 billion in
the fourth quarter of 1992. Average loans for the same periods totaled $18.8
billion and $16.3 billion, respectively. Approximately one-third of the
increase in loans and one-half of the increase in noninterest-bearing deposits
during the fourth quarter, as compared with the same period in 1992, were
attributable to cyclical activity in the Company's portfolio of secured loans to
mortgage banking firms and related escrow balances. In the last half of 1993,
this portfolio included a $700 million low margin extension of credit, which is
fully secured by short-term U.S. Treasury securities and is expected to be
outstanding until the third quarter of 1994.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1.15 billion for
1993, an increase of $132.8 million, or 13 percent, from last year. The
improvement in net interest income reflects increases in average earning assets
of $1.7 billion, or 8.2 percent, and average noninterest-bearing deposits of
$1.6 billion, or 33.4 percent. Average earning assets totaled $22.7 billion in
1993, compared with $21.0 billion in 1992. Average loans totaled $17.8 billion
in 1993, compared with $16.3 billion in 1992. About one-fourth of the increase
in loans and one-third of the increase in noninterest-bearing deposits during
the year were attributable to mortgage banking lending activities.

The net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis was 5.00 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1993, an increase of 9 basis points from 4.91 percent for
the fourth quarter of 1992. Net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis
for the year was 5.07 percent in 1993, an increase of 22 basis points from 4.85
percent for 1992. The improvements in net interest margin from 1992 resulted
generally from decreased funding costs.

Fourth quarter noninterest income was $145.9 million, an increase of $8.8
million, or 6.4 percent, from the same quarter of 1992. For the year,
noninterest income was $569.6 million, an increase of $33.9 million, or 6.3
percent, from 1992. The increase for both periods resulted

(MORE)

<PAGE>

generally from higher credit card and trust fees. Trust fees, service charges
and credit card fees for the quarter increased $11.7 million, or 12.8 percent,
from the fourth quarter of 1992, and fees for the year increased $45.4 million,
or 12.9 percent, from 1992. Trust fees in 1993 reflect income from the
corporate trust business units purchased from Bankers Trust Company of
California in July of 1992 and U.S. Bancorp in March of 1993. Most of the
increase in credit card fees, for the quarter and the year, is attributable to
higher volumes for the Company's Corporate Card product. Insurance commissions
were lower in 1993 than in 1992 as a result of the sale of the Montana and Twin
Cities Metro insurance agencies in the fourth quarter of 1992 and first quarter
of 1993, respectively. The 2.2 percent decline in other noninterest income for
the year reflects approximately $28 million in net charges related to the
accelerated amortization of mortgage loan servicing rights due to prepayments in
the Company's mortgage servicing portfolio, partially offset by $11 million in
one-time gains from the sale of assets.

Fourth quarter noninterest expense was lower by $3.3 million, or 1.3
percent, than in the fourth quarter of 1992, excluding merger-related charges.
Compared with noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 1992, including the
operations of BSI on a pro forma basis and excluding merger-related charges,
noninterest expense for the quarter declined by $28.3 million, or 10 percent.
Excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense for 1993 was $1.03
billion, an increase of $24.4 million, or 2.4 percent, over the same period of
1992. Compared with noninterest expense for 1992, including the operations of
BSI on a pro forma basis and excluding merger-related charges, noninterest
expense for the year declined $76.7 million, or 6.9 percent. Generally, the
decrease in expenses for the year reflects success in integrating recent
acquisitions.

Total salaries and benefits expense for the fourth quarter decreased by
$7.1 million, or 5.8 percent, from that of the fourth quarter of 1992. Salaries
and benefits expense for the year was essentially unchanged from that of 1992.
Fourth quarter and full year net occupancy and equipment expense increased over
the same periods in 1992 by $2.7 million, or 6.9 percent, and $11 million, or
7.1 percent, respectively, because of costs associated with acquisitions and
recent investments in technology. The premium expense on FDIC insurance was
higher in both periods in 1993 than in 1992 because of generally higher deposit
levels. Amortization of goodwill and intangibles was higher in 1993 than in
1992 due to the acquisition, on a purchase basis, of BSI and the corporate trust
units.

Fourth quarter provision for credit losses was lower by $12.3 million than
in the fourth quarter of 1992, excluding $13.6 million in 1992 merger-related
charges. For the year, the provision for credit losses decreased by $44.6
million, or 26.3 percent, from 1992, excluding merger-related charges. Fourth
quarter net charge-offs totaled $31 million, compared with $58.3 million in the
fourth quarter of 1992. Commercial and consumer loans net charge-offs for the
quarter were lower than in the fourth quarter of 1992 by $21.8 million, or 73.6
percent, and $5.5 million, or 19.2 percent, respectively. For the year, net
charge-offs totaled $150 million during

1993, down from $203.1 million for 1992. Total commercial loan net charge-offs
for 1993 were lower by $25.7 million, or 28.7 percent, than for the same period
of 1992. Net charge-offs for consumer loans in 1993 were down by $27.4 million,
or 24.1 percent, from 1992. The lower provisions and net charge-offs for the
quarter and the year resulted from improved credit quality.

Nonperforming assets at December 31, 1993 totaled $226 million, down by
$40.8 million, or 15.3 percent, from the end of third quarter, and by $186.1
million, or 45.2 percent, from the total at December 31, 1992. The ratio of
nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate improved to 1.20 percent at
December 31, 1993, from 1.43 percent at September 30, 1993 and 2.39 percent at
December 31, 1992.

During the fourth quarter of 1993, nonperforming loans decreased $25.9
million, or 14.1 percent and other real estate decreased $13.7 million, or 16.9
percent, generally the result of repayments of loans and sales of properties.

A significant change in the balance of nonperforming assets at December 31,
1993, as compared with the end of 1992, occurred in other real estate, which was
down $90.8 million, or 57.4 percent, principally due to sales of properties.
Nonperforming HLT loans decreased primarily because one large loan, placed on
nonaccrual in December of 1992, was paid in full in the third quarter of 1993.
The increase in nonperforming consumer loans during the year resulted

from the purchase in the third quarter of 1993 of $25.7 million of delinquent
residential mortgages in connection with a sale of mortgage loan servicing
rights. These loans are supported by government-sponsored mortgage insurance.

On December 31, 1993, First Bank System adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities," which requires that investments in debt and equity
securities be classified into one of three categories, trading,
held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale. At year-end 1993, the entire
investment portfolio was classified as available for sale, which requires that
the securities be accounted for at their current market value with unrealized
holding gains or losses reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The
related after-tax unrealized gain included in shareholders' equity at December
31, 1993 was $34 million; the adoption of SFAS 115 had no effect on 1993
earnings.

Capital ratios at December 31, 1993 reflect the impact of recent share
repurchases. At year-end 1993, the common-equity-to-assets ratio was 7.5
percent, slightly below the ratio of 7.7 percent at the end of third quarter,
but above the bank peer group average of 7.3 percent at September 30, 1993, as
well as the Company's ratio of 7.3 percent at December 31, 1992. Shareholders'
equity-to-assets at December 31, 1993 was 8.5 percent, compared with 8.8 percent
at the end of third quarter, 8.7 percent at the end of 1992 and a peer group
average of 7.9 percent at September 30, 1993.
