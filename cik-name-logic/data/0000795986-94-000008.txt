Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On March 16, 1994, Thermo Instrument Systems Inc. ("Thermo Instrument" or the
"Company") acquired substantially all of the assets, subject to certain
liabilities, of the EnviroTech Controls, NORAN Instruments, TN Technologies,
Tremetrics, and Epsilon Industrial businesses (the "EnviroTech Measurements &
Controls Companies") of Baker Hughes Incorporated for a cash purchase price of
$87.3 million, subject to a post-closing adjustment. The purchase price was
based on the Company's determination of the fair value of the acquired
businesses and negotiations with Baker Hughes Incorporated (Baker Hughes). The
acquired businesses, which are part of the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls
group of Baker Hughes, collectively design, manufacture and market a variety of
process control, process measurement and laboratory analytical products for use
in a wide range of industrial, energy, environmental and research applications.
The purchase price was funded from cash on hand.

Thermo Electron Corporation ("Thermo Electron"), the parent company of Thermo
Instrument, entered into an acquisition agreement with Baker Hughes in January
1994 with respect to this transaction and a related transaction in which another
Thermo Electron subsidiary, Thermedics Inc., acquired a company that is also
part of the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls group. Thermo Electron assigned
its rights to acquire the respective businesses to the Company and Thermedics
Inc.

The Company has no present intention to use the equipment or other assets
acquired for purposes materially different from the purposes for which such
assets were used prior to the acquisition. However, the Company will review the
assets, corporate structure, capitalization, operations, properties, policies,
management and personnel of the acquired businesses and, upon completion of this
review, may develop alternative plans or proposals, including mergers, transfers
of a material amount of assets or other transactions or changes relating to the
businesses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholder and Board of Directors of EnviroTech
Measurements & Controls Companies:

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheet of the
EnviroTech Measurements & Controls Companies, as of September 30,
1993, and the related combined statements of operations, cash flows
and stockholder's investment for the year then ended. These combined
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
combined financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls Companies as of September 30,
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1993

1. SALE OF THE COMPANY

EnviroTech Controls, Inc., NORAN Instruments, Inc., TN
Technologies, Inc., Tremetrics, Inc. and Epsilon Industrial, Inc.
(the "EnviroTech Measurements & Controls Companies") were all
wholly owned subsidiaries of Baker Hughes Incorporated ("Baker
Hughes"), the former parent. On March 16, 1994, the EnviroTech
Measurements & Controls Companies (the "Company") were purchased
by Thermo Instrument Systems Inc. (the "Parent") for a cash
purchase price of approximately $87.3 million, subject to a
post-closing adjustment. Thermo Instrument Systems Inc. is an
81%-owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation. No
adjustment has been made to the combined financial statements due
to or as a result of this transaction. All significant
intercompany items have been eliminated in the combined financial
statements. 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Stockholder's Investment - Stockholder's investment represents
Baker Hughes' investment in and advances to the Company and the
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. 

Revenue Recognition - Revenues from sales are recognized when
goods are shipped. Reserves for sales returns and warranty claims
are recorded based upon historical experience. Revenues from
services are recognized at the time services are performed.

Inventories - Inventories are stated primarily at the lower of
average cost or market value and include materials, labor and
manufacturing overhead. Inventories consisted of the following at
September 30, 1993 (In Thousands):

Raw materials $11,826
Work-in-process 10,481
Finished goods 9,298
-------
Total $31,605
=======

Property, Plant and Equipment - The costs of additions and
improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is primarily provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the property as follows: building and improvements - 10 to 20
years and machinery and equipment - 5 to 10 years.

Goodwill - Goodwill arose primarily from Baker Hughes' purchase of
the Instruments Group from Tracor Holdings, Inc. in May 1990 and
is being amortized over 40 years. Management of the Company

Page 7PAGE
<PAGE>
ENVIROTECH MEASUREMENTS & CONTROLS COMPANIES

periodically reviews the carrying value of goodwill in relation to
current and expected operating results of the segments of business
that benefit from the goodwill in order to assess whether there
has been a permanent impairment of goodwill.

Income Taxes - The Company's operations are included in groups
that file consolidated or combined income tax returns with other
Baker Hughes operations. Baker Hughes' intercompany tax
allocation policy is for each division to calculate income tax
expense on a stand-alone basis without regard to the utilization
of net operating loss carryforwards or tax-planning strategies. In
addition, full benefit is given to the current year's operating
loss.

Deferred income taxes are determined utilizing the liability
approach as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This method
gives consideration to the future tax consequences associated with
differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities.

Environmental Matters - Remediation costs are accrued based on
estimates of known environmental remediation exposure. Such
accruals that are insignificant in relation to the combined
financial statements at September 30, 1993, are recorded when
reasonably estimable even if significant uncertainties exist over
the amount of the loss. Ongoing environmental compliance costs,
including maintenance and monitoring costs, are expensed as
incurred. Such amounts were insignificant for the year ended
September 30, 1993.

Foreign Currency - All assets and liabilities of the Company's
foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates,
and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
for the year in accordance with SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency
Translation." Resulting translation adjustments are reflected as
a separate component of stockholder's investment titled
"Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment." Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
accompanying combined statement of operations and are not material
for the year ended September 30, 1993.

3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment consists of the following at
September 30, 1993 (In Thousands):

Land $ 294
Buildings and improvements 3,007
Machinery and equipment 22,593
-------
Total 25,894
Less: Accumulated depreciation 14,686
-------
Total $11,208
=======

ENVIROTECH MEASUREMENTS & CONTROLS COMPANIES

4. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Other intangible assets consist primarily of intangible assets
associated with the Instruments Group acquisition in 1990 (See
Note 2). These assets are being amortized over periods ranging
from 5 to 17 years. The balances, net of accumulated
amortization, at September 30, 1993 are as follows (In Thousands):

Patents $ 1,970
Software 3,928
Drawings 4,621
Workforce 2,581
Other 1,767
-------
Total $14,867
=======

5. INCOME TAXES

The Company's U.S. operating results are included within the Baker
Hughes U.S. consolidated income tax return. Under the tax-sharing
agreement in place, the Company is allowed to fully benefit any
losses generated in the United States. Also, the Company
generally operates as a division of the Baker Hughes legal entity
in each respective foreign jurisdiction. Each of the Company's
foreign operations is generally allowed to fully benefit losses
incurred in their respective jurisdictions. Under these worldwide
policies, the tax accounts of the Company are stated as if there
were no limitations on losses generated by the Company's business
operations.

The Company currently operates under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes." It
intends to prospectively adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
effective October 1, 1993. On a stand-alone basis, the adoption
of SFAS 109 will have no significant effect on the combined
financial statements. 

The components of loss before taxes at September 30, 1993 are as
follows (In Thousands):

Domestic $(12,510)
Foreign 2,341
--------
Total $(10,169)
========

The income tax benefit differs from the benefit calculated by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to loss
before taxes for the year ended September 30, 1993 due to the
following (In Thousands):

Income tax benefit at statutory rate $(3,559)
Decreases resulting from:
State income taxes, net of federal tax 23
Foreign tax rate and tax law differential 176
Amortization of cost in excess of net
assets of acquired companies 261
Other, net 322
-------
Total $(2,777)

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company participates in the Baker Hughes Thrift Plan (the
"Thrift Plan") whereby eligible employees elect to contribute from
2% to 10% of their salaries to an investment trust. Employee
contributions are matched by the Company at the rate of $.50 per
$1.00 up to 6% of the employee's salary. In addition, the Company
contributes for all eligible employees between 2% and 5% of their
salary depending on the employee's age as of January 1 each year.
Generally, Company contributions become fully vested to the
employee after five years of employment. The Company's
contributions to the Thrift Plan amounted to $1,676,000 in 1993.

The Company also participates in various Baker Hughes defined
benefit pension plans. Costs related to these pension plans
totaled $164,000 in 1993.

The Company participates in a Baker Hughes sponsored plan whereby
certain health care (primarily in the United States) and life
insurance benefits are provided for retired employees.
Substantially all employees may become eligible for these benefits
if they reach normal retirement age while working for the Company.
Costs related to benefits provided for retired employees are
expensed as incurred and totaled $171,000 in 1993.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS 106"),
"Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
in December 1990. The statement requires accrual basis accounting
for such benefits as opposed to the Company's current method of
cash basis accounting. The Company will adopt this statement
effective October 1, 1993. The Company has elected to immediately
recognize the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle and will record a charge to income of approximately
$2,029,000, net of income taxes of $1,093,000. Expenses under
SFAS 106 for 1994 related to these benefits are estimated to be
$323,000.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

At September 30, 1993, the Company had long-term operating leases
covering certain facilities and equipment on which minimum annual
rental commitments for the years ending September 30, 1994, 1995,
1996, 1997 and 1998 are $2,619,000, $2,215,000, $2,046,000,
$1,859,000 and $1,732,000, respectively, and $15,965,000 in the
aggregate thereafter. Rent expense was $3,069,000 in 1993.

Subsequent to year end, as a result of the Thermo Instrument
Systems Inc. acquisition of the Company, certain leased facilities
were purchased from the former parent's leasing division. Minimum
annual rental commitments for the years ended September 30, 1994,
1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 will be reduced as a result of the

Page 11PAGE
<PAGE>
ENVIROTECH MEASUREMENTS & CONTROLS COMPANIES

acquisition by $397,000, $397,000, $397,000, $397,000, and
$402,000, respectively, and $4,363,000 in the aggregate
thereafter.

At September 30, 1993, there were no contingencies, claims or
lawsuits against the Company that, in the opinion of management,
will have a significant effect on its combined financial
statements.

8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Certain services are provided to various subsidiaries of Baker
Hughes at prices comparable to those received from unaffiliated
customers.

The Company participates in the Baker Hughes cash management
system. As a result, the bank overdraft at September 30, 1993
represents checks that have not been presented to the bank for
payment.

The Company leases certain operating facilities from Baker Hughes.
Rent expense paid to Baker Hughes totaled $876,000 in 1993.

9. INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The Company operates primarily in the instrumentation industry.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. General

The interim combined financial statements presented have been
prepared by the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls Companies
without audit and, in the opinion of management, reflect all
adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair
statement of (a) the results of operations for the three-month
periods ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, (b) the financial
position at December 31, 1993, and (c) the cash flows for the
three-month periods ended December 31, 1993 and 1992. Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.

2. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

Effective October 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS 106"), "Employers'
Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The
statement requires accrual basis accounting for such benefits. The
Company elected to immediately recognize the cumulative effect of
the change in accounting principle and recorded a charge to income
of approximately $2,029,000, net of income taxes of $1,093,000. 

Effective October 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting
for Income Taxes." The adoption of SFAS 109 did not have a
significant effect on the combined financial statements.

(b) Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statement sets forth the results of operations for the year ended
January 1, 1994, as if the acquisition of the EnviroTech Measurements &
Controls Companies by the Company had occurred at the beginning of
fiscal 1993 and assuming there is no post-closing purchase price
adjustment. The pro forma combined condensed statement of income

consummated at the beginning of fiscal 1993. The combined financial
statements filed under part (a) of this item should be read in

statements.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENT
(Unaudited)

Note A - Basis of Presentation

The allocation of the purchase price is based on an estimate of the fair
value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment. To date, no
information has been gathered that would cause the Company to believe that the
final allocation of the purchase price will be materially different than the
preliminary estimate.

Note B - Pro Forma Adjustments to Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement 
of Income

The pro forma adjustment to "Cost of instrument revenues" represents the
increase in the carrying value of the EnviroTech Measurements & Controls
Companies' finished goods inventory to the estimated selling price, less the sum
of costs of disposal and a reasonable allowance for the Company's selling
efforts.

The pro forma adjustment to "Selling, general and administrative expenses"
represents the amortization over 40 years of $52,873,000 of "Cost in excess of
net assets of acquired companies" created by the acquisition of the EnviroTech
Measurements & Controls Companies.

The pro forma adjustment to "Interest income" represents an estimate of the
decrease in interest income attributable to the lower cash position as a result
of the total cash payment of $87,289,000 to acquire the EnviroTech Measurements
& Controls Companies, calculated using an average interest rate of 3.52%.

The pro forma adjustment to "Income tax provision (benefit)" represents a
reduction in income taxes associated with the adjustments above, calculated at
the Company's statutory income tax rate of 41%.
