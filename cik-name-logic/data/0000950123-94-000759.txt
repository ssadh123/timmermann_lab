Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Data
General Statement

The following unaudited pro forma financial data were derived from the
historical consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet gives effect to the sale of the
Company's 50% interest in a joint venture and the application of the proceeds
therefrom to redeem a portion of the Company's 12-3/8% Subordinated Debentures
as if all such transactions had occurred on January 28, 1994. The Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year
ended October 29, 1993 and three months ended January 28, 1994 give effect as
if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the respective fiscal
periods.

The pro forma adjustments are based on currently available information and upon
certain assumptions that management of the Company believes are reasonable
under the circumstances.

The pro forma financial data are provided for informational purposes only and
do not purport to represent what the Company's financial position or results of
operations actually would have been had the aforementioned transactions been
completed as of the date or at the beginning of the periods indicated, or to
project the Company's financial position or results of operations at any future
date or for any future period.

of the parties to this Agreement, based on or arising out of any of the claims,
events, transactions or matters related to the JVA or JV, and, except for the
matters covered by Section 12 hereof, each party, for itself and its
affiliates, hereby waives any rights it might have at law or in equity to

have under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which states as follows:

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
release, which if known by him must have materially affected his 
settlement with the debtor."

7. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement may affect the settlement of
claims that are denied and contested, and that nothing contained herein may or
shall be construed as an admission against any party.

8. Each of the parties hereby respectively acknowledges that said party

negotiations which preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that said
party has read this Agreement, has had its contents fully explained by such
counsel, and is fully aware of and understands all of its terms and the tax and
legal consequences thereof. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges that the
other party, and any agent or attorney of the other party, has not made any
promise, representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, to induce
said party to execute this Agreement, and acknowledges that said party has not
authorized the execution of this Agreement in reliance on any such promise,
representation or warranty not contained herein.

9. Each party agrees to use its best efforts to obtain all governmental
and regulatory approvals necessary or helpful to effectuate this Agreement
according to its terms.

10. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the domestic laws 
of the State of California.

11. a. Before resorting to litigation, the parties will attempt in good
faith to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement promptly by negotiations between executives of the parties before
resorting to litigation.

or claim in accordance with the Center for Public Resources Model Procedure for
Mediation of Business Disputes.

d. If the matter has not been resolved pursuant to the 
aforesaid mediation procedure within 60 days of the commencement of such

The arbitration shall be governed in accordance with California law. The
arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California, and shall be conducted
on a confidential basis. The arbitrators' award shall be supported by law and
substantial evidence, and judgement upon the award rendered by the arbitrators
may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

12. The provisions of Sections 8A and 12 of the JVA shall be deemed 
repeated herein as if fully set forth and shall survive the termination of the
JV and shall remain binding on VIS and its successors in interest for the
period of time necessary to resolve with any taxing authority (federal, state,
local and foreign) any and all matters regarding the taxation of JV.

Each party signing this Agreement represents and warrants to each of 
the other parties signing this agreement that, except as stated in JV books
as of the date of redemption, (a) the party has not incurred any obligation or
liability on behalf of or as apparent agent of JV or the other parties, or for
which the party or any other parties may be charged, or for which the party
intends to claim refund or reimbursement from JV, and (b) the party has not
received, discharged, or transferred any credit, money, property, or other
assets of JV. Each party further represents and warrants to each other party
that it has not done or failed to do anything to incur any obligation or
liability owing by JV other than obligations and liabilities

incurred pursuant to actions authorized by the terms and conditions of the JVA.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, VIS and its 
successors in interest shall remain liable for one-half of any tax deficiency
that may now exist or may hereafter arise out of JV activities through February
28, 1994 which is not shown as accrued or as to which no reserve has been
created on the books of the JV at that date. For this purpose, the term "tax"
includes, but is not limited to, federal and state income, property, sales, and
excise taxes. The term "deficiency" includes taxes, interest, and penalties. 
The term "PacVis activities" includes formation, operation, and dissolution of
the JV.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the lease 
between Landlord and Volt Fletcher Building Corp. as landlords (the last
mentioned corporation having since been merged with Landlord) and JV as tenant,
dated as of December 12, 1986 as amended by a lease amendment dated September
10, 1987, (collectively, "lease"), shall remain in full force and effect, and,
effective April 1, 1994, the tenant's interest under the lease is hereby
assigned by JV to PBD, as successor in interest to JV. PBD accepts such
assignment and shall be tenant under the lease from and after April 1, 1994.
Landlord consents to such assignment and agrees to recognize PBD as tenant
under the lease.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, liabilities of
JV to third parties existing as of the date of redemption, except for the tax
liabilities mentioned above in this section, and except for any liabilities
resulting from any breach by VIS or Volt of any warranty or representation set
forth in this section, shall be assumed by PBD, as successor in interest of JV,
and PBD shall indemnify and hold harmless VIS from and against such assumed
liabilities.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, from and
after the date of redemption and filing of notice of dissolution, JV shall be
deemed dissolved and PBD, as successor in interest of JV, shall be sole owner
of the business and its assets with the unencumbered right to operate the
business for its own benefit. From and after March 1, 1994, PBD shall be
entitled to all profits and distributions from JV. PBD may continue to use the
names Pacific Volt Information Systems and PacVis in connection with the
operations of the business, up to and including December 31, 1996. Each party
to this Agreement and its successors in interest shall cooperate fully with
each of the other parties to this Agreement and their respective successors in
interest so as to allow PBD and its successors in interest to continue to
operate the business, provided, however, that the party seeking such
cooperation shall reimburse the party

providing such cooperation for its reasonable expenses attributable to the
provision of such cooperation.

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

14. Each person signing this Agreement on behalf of each party to this
