Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On January 14, 1994, Zions Bancorporation (the "Registrant")
completed its acquisition of National Bancorp of Arizona Inc.
("NBA"). As a result of the acquisition, NBA merged in a two-step
merger into Zions (the "Holding Company Merger") and NBA's
wholly-owned subsidiary, National Bank of Arizona, merged into
the Registrant's wholly-owned subsidiary, Zions First National
Bank of Arizona (the "Bank Merger"). Upon consummation of the
Bank Merger, the bank resulting from the Bank Merger changed its
name to National Bank of Arizona and continued to be a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Registrant. The bank resulting from the
Bank Merger will continue to operate under the existing
management team of National Bank of Arizona. 

In the transaction the Registrant issued and exchanged .45
shares of the Registrant's common stock, for each share of NBA
common stock, or a total of 1,455,000 shares of its stock.
