WMX TECHNOLOGIES AND CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT
REACH AGREEMENT ON ACQUISITION OF CHEM WASTE PUBLIC SHARES

Oak Brook, Illinois, Friday, October 14, 1994--WMX Technologies, Inc., the 
global environmental services company, and its Chemical Waste Management, Inc. 
subsidiary today jointly announced that a definitive merger agreement has been 
reached between them under which WMX will proceed to acquire all of the 
approximately 44.9 million Chemical Waste Management shares which it does not 
already own.

The agreement enhances the initial proposal made by WMX to Chemical Waste 
Management on July 28, increasing the value to be offered Chemical Waste 
Management's public stockholders. Under the terms of the proposal announced 
today, Chemical Waste Management's public stockholders would receive a WMX 
subordinated note (described more fully below) which is immediately convertible 
into a number of WMX shares, or, at WMX's option, their equivalent market value 
in cash, on the basis of a conversion ratio using an implied value of $8.85 per 
Chemical Waste Management share. WMX's initial proposal contemplated a 
stock-for-stock exchange which valued Chemical Waste Management shares at $7.86 
per share.

The terms of the agreement were approved unanimously by a special committee
of Chemical Waste Management's independent directors. The special committee had 
received an opinion from CS First Boston Corporation, its financial adviser, to 
the effect that the consideration to be received by Chemical Waste Management's 
public stockholders in the merger is fair to such holders from a financial point
of view. The agreement also has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both
companies.

The transaction, which will be taxable under the revised terms being 
announced today, remains subject to the approval of the holders of a majority 
of Chemical Waste Management's outstanding shares, other than those held by WMX,
voting on it at a special meeting of Chemical Waste Management stockholders to 
be called for that purpose.

<PAGE>

The agreement's terms provide for Chemical Waste Management's public 
stockholders to receive a convertible subordinated note due 2005, with a 
principal amount at maturity of $1,000, for every 81.1 Chemical Waste Management
shares held at the time of the merger. The notes will be issued by WMX to 
produce a yield to maturity of 5.75 percent per annum on $717.80 per note (the 
"stated issue price"), computed on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis, 
calculated from the issue date. WMX will pay semi-annual cash interest payments 
on the notes of $20 per annum (equal to 2 percent per annum of the $1,000
principal amount at maturity).

At the option of the holder, each note will be purchased for cash by WMX on
the third and fifth anniversaries of the issue date for $786.38 and $839.03, 
respectively, which represent the stated issue price plus accrued original issue
discount on those dates. The notes will be redeemable by WMX after the fifth 
anniversary (but not before) for cash at the stated issue price plus accrued 
original issue discount and accrued but unpaid interest through the date of 
redemption.

In addition, each note will be convertible at any time prior to maturity--
unless previously purchased or redeemed by WMX--into a number of shares of WMX
common stock to be determined by dividing the stated issue price per note of 
$717.80 by the average New York Stock Exchange closing prices of WMX common 
stock during the 10 trading days immediately preceding the special CWM 
stockholders meeting to be held to consider the merger. The conversion rate will
be not fewer than 21.90 shares nor more than 26.76 shares per note. Upon any 
such conversion, WMX will have the option of paying cash equal to the market 
value of the WMX shares which would otherwise be issuable.

The special meeting of Chemical Waste Management stockholders is expected 
to be held in January 1995. Chemical Waste Management said it currently expects 
to communicate specific details on the proposed merger to its stockholders 
during December.

WMX owns approximately 78.6 percent of Chemical Waste Management's 
approximately 209.1 million outstanding shares.
