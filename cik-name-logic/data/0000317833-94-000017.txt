is Continuing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
paragraphs (a) through (f), any prepayment of principal of
the Loans made or required to be made pursuant to
paragraphs (a) through (e) while any Event of Default is
continuing shall reduce the remaining Installments by the
amount of such prepayment in the order specified by the
Required Lenders.

Rate Tranche, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate
Base Rate from time to time in effect plus the Alternate
Base Rate Margin in effect at such time; and

(b) on any portion of such Loan that constitutes a
Eurodollar Tranche, at a rate per annum equal to the
Eurodollar Rate (Reserved Adjusted) applicable to each
Interest Period for such Tranche plus the Eurodollar Rate
Margin in effect at such time;

provided, that in no event shall the rate of interest on any
Tranche exceed the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law.

SECTION 3.4.2. Interest on Overdue Amounts. The Borrower
will, on demand, pay interest on any overdue Installments, or
any portion thereof which shall become due under Section

principal amount of the Loans converted into Base Rate
Tranches or Eurodollar Tranches on a day when interest

Commitments shall terminate and the date the initial Loans
are made. Commitment Fees shall be computed at the annual
rate of one-half of one percent (.5%), and shall be payable
in arrears on the last day of each Fiscal Quarter beginning
September 30, 1993, and on the earlier to occur of the date
the Commitments shall terminate and the date the initial

SECTION 3.5.3. Agents Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Managing Agents,
an agents fee (the "Agents Fee"), in accordance with the

SECTION 3.6. Making and Proration of Payments;
Computations; etc.

SECTION 3.6.1. Making of Payments. All payments of
principal of and interest on the Notes, and all payments of
Fees, shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent in immediately available funds at its Domestic Office
not later than noon, Boston time, on the date due, and funds
received after that hour shall be deemed to have been
received by the Administrative Agent on the next following
Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit
to each Lender or Agent its share (if any) of all such
payments received in collected funds by the Administrative
Agent. All payments under Sections 4.5, 4.8, 12.3 and 12.4
<PAGE>

- 45 -

shall be made by the Borrower directly to the Lender or
Lenders entitled thereto. Each payment of principal shall be
applied to such Tranches as the Borrower shall direct by
notice to be received by the Administrative Agent on or
before the date of payment, or, in the absence of such
notice, as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its
discretion. Concurrently with its remittance to any Lender
of its share of any such payment, the Administrative Agent
shall advise such Lender as to the application of such
payment.

SECTION 3.6.2. Setoff. Each Principal Company agrees that
each Agent and each Lender shall have all rights of set-off
and bankers' lien provided by Applicable Law, and in addition
thereto, each Principal Company agrees that if at any time
any payment or other amount owing by such Principal Company
under this Agreement is then due to any Agent or any Lender,
such Agent or Lender may apply to the payment of such payment
or other amount any and all balances, credits, deposits,
accounts or moneys of such Principal Company then or
thereafter deposited or held by such Person.

SECTION 3.6.3. Proration of Payments. If any Lender or
other holder of a Note shall obtain by payment or other
recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of
setoff or otherwise) of principal of or interest on any Note
in excess of its Ratable share of payments and other
recoveries obtained by all Lenders or other holders of Notes
(other than in respect of an Affected Tranche), such Lender
or other holder shall purchase from the other Lenders or
holders such participations in the Notes held by them as
shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender or other
holder to share the excess payment or other recovery Ratably
with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender or holder, the
purchase of such participation shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery. The
Borrower agrees that any Lender or other holder of a Note so
purchasing a participation from another Lender or holder
pursuant to this Section shall be entitled to all rights of
set-off and bankers' lien with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans in
the amount of such participation.

SECTION 3.6.4. Due Date Extension. If any payment of
principal of or interest on any of the Notes, or of any Fees,
falls due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due
date shall be extended to the next following Business Day
(unless, in the case of interest due on the principal amount
of any Eurodollar Tranche, such next following Business Day
is the first day of a calendar month, in which case such due
date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day), and
additional interest and Commitment Fees shall accrue and be
payable for the period of such extension.

SECTION 3.6.5. Notice of Changes in Alternate Base Rate;
Notice of Eurodollar Rates. Changes in the rate of interest
on any Base Rate Tranches shall take effect simultaneously
<PAGE>

- 46 -

with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. The
Administrative Agent shall give notice promptly to the
Borrower and the Lenders of changes in the Alternate Base
Rate. The applicable Eurodollar Rate for each Interest
Period shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and
notice thereof shall be given by the Administrative Agent
promptly to the Borrower and each Lender. Each determination
of the Alternate Base Rate and the applicable Eurodollar Rate
by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto, in the absence of manifest error.
The Administrative Agent shall, upon written request of the
Borrower or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower or such
Lender a statement showing the computations used by the
Administrative Agent in determining any applicable Eurodollar
Rate hereunder. Each Reference Lender agrees to furnish to
the Administrative Agent timely information for determining
the applicable Eurodollar Rate. If any one or more of the
Reference Lenders shall fail to timely furnish such
information to the Administrative Agent for any such interest
rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest
rate on the basis of the information furnished by the
remaining Reference Lenders.

SECTION 3.6.6. Computations. Interest and Commitment Fees
shall be computed based on the actual number of days elapsed
and a year of 360 days.

SECTION 3.6.7. Recordkeeping. Each Lender shall record in
its records, or at its option on the schedule attached to its
Note, the date and amount of the Loan made by such Lender,
each repayment and prepayment thereof and, in the case of
each Eurodollar Tranche, the principal amount thereof and the
dates on which each Interest Period for such Tranche shall
begin and end. The aggregate unpaid principal amount so
recorded shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the
principal amount owing and unpaid on such Note. The failure
to so record any such amount or any error in so recording any
such amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or
under any Note to repay the principal amount of the Loan
evidenced by such Note together with all interest accruing
thereon.

SECTION 3.7. Taxes. All payments of principal of and
interest on the Notes and of all Fees and other amounts
payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
present or future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes or
other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or charges of any
nature whatsoever imposed by any Governmental Authority, but
excluding franchise taxes imposed on any Lender and taxes
imposed on any Lender measured by such Lender's net income or
receipts (all non-excluded items being called "Taxes"). If
any withholding or deduction from any such payment to be made
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents is
required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any Applicable
Law, then the Borrower or other Transaction Party obligated
to make such payment will:
<PAGE>

- 47 -

(a) pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority
the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;

(b) promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an
official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent evidencing that the Borrower or other
Transaction Party obligated to make such payment has made
such payment to such Governmental Authority; and

(c) pay to the Administrative Agent such additional
amounts as are necessary to ensure that the net amount
actually received by each Secured Party will equal the full
amount such Secured Party would have received had no such
withholding or deduction been required.

Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against any
Secured Party with respect to any payment received by such
Secured Party hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents, such Secured Party may pay such Taxes and the
Borrower or other Transaction Party obligated to make such
payment will promptly pay such additional amounts (including
any penalty, interest and expense) as are necessary in order
that the net amount received by such Secured Party after the
payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional
amount) shall equal the amount such Secured Party would have
received had such Taxes not been asserted.

If any Transaction Party fails to pay any Taxes when due to
the appropriate Governmental Authority or fails to remit to
the Administrative Agent when due any payments required by
this Section 3.7 or any required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the
Secured Parties for any incremental Taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by any Secured Party as a
result of any such failure and shall promptly pay to the
Administrative Agent any amounts not paid when due to the
Administrative Agent as required by this Section 3.7.

SECTION 3.8. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower covenants and
agrees that the proceeds of the Loans made pursuant hereto
will be applied:

(a) first, to the payment or prepayment in full on the
Effective Date of all Obligations (as defined in the
Existing Loan Agreement) then outstanding,

(b) second, to the payment or prepayment in full on the
Effective Date of all obligations then outstanding of the
Borrower under the Loan Agreement, dated as of December 23,
1991, among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and
The Bank of New York, as agent (the "Existing WGHP Loan
Agreement"), and 

(c) third, for general working capital purposes, and to
pay costs and expenses incurred by the Borrower in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

FUNDING OPTIONS

SECTION 4.1. Pricing Tranches of Each Loan.
The outstanding principal amount of the Loan made
by each Lender may be allocated among pricing
tranches (individually, a "Tranche" and
collectively, "Tranches") selected by the Borrower
from time to time in accordance with Sections 3.1,
4.2 and 4.3 hereof. Each Tranche shall be either a
Base Rate Tranche or a Eurodollar Tranche (each a
"type" of Tranche), as the Borrower shall specify
in the initial notice of borrowing pursuant to
Section 3.1, or any Continuation/Conversion Notice
pursuant to Section 4.2 or 4.3. All Base Rate
Tranches, and all Eurodollar Tranches having the
same Interest Period, may sometimes be referred to
as a "Group" of Tranches.

SECTION 4.2. Conversion Procedures. Subject
to the provisions of Section 4.4, the Borrower may
convert all or any part of any outstanding Group of
Tranches into a Group of Tranches of a different
type by delivering a Continuation/Conversion Notice
to the Administrative Agent not later than (a) in
the case of conversion into a Base Rate Tranche,
9:30 A.M., Boston time, on the proposed date of
such conversion, and (b) in the case of a
conversion into a Eurodollar Tranche, 9:30 A.M.,
Boston time, at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the proposed date of such conversion. Each such
notice shall be irrevocable upon receipt by the
Administrative Agent and shall specify the date and
amount of such conversion, the Group of Tranches
(or portion thereof) to be so converted, the type
of Tranche to be converted into and, in the case of
a conversion into a Eurodollar Tranche, the initial
Interest Period therefor; provided, however, that
no Eurodollar Tranche shall be converted on any day
other than the last day of its Interest Period.
Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender
thereof. Subject to the provisions of this Section
4.2 and Section 4.4, each Tranche shall be so
converted on the requested date of conversion.

SECTION 4.3. Continuation Procedures. Subject
to the provisions of Section 4.4, the Borrower may
continue all or any part of any outstanding Group
of Eurodollar Tranches for an additional Interest
Period commencing upon the conclusion of the
Interest Period then in effect for such Group of
Eurodollar Tranches, by delivering a
Continuation/Conversion Notice to the
Administrative Agent not later than 9:30 A.M.,
Boston time, at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the end of such then-current Interest Period.
Each such notice shall be irrevocable upon receipt
by the Administrative Agent and shall specify the
amount to be so continued, the date of such
<PAGE>

- 49 -

continuation and the Interest Period therefor that
is to commence upon the termination of the
then-current Interest Period. Promptly upon
receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise each Lender thereof.

SECTION 4.4. Limitations on Interest Periods
and Continuation and Conversion Elections. The
Borrower's rights under Sections 3.1, 4.2 and 4.3
hereof shall be subject to the following
limitations.

SECTION 4.4.1. Interest Periods. Each
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Tranche shall
commence on the date the Loan is made, if
applicable, or on the date such Tranche is
converted from a Base Rate Tranche, or, in the case
of a continuation, on the expiration of the
immediately preceding Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Tranche, and shall end on the date which
is one, two, three or six months thereafter, as the
Borrower may specify in the related notice of
borrowing pursuant to Section 3.1, or
Continuation/Conversion Notice pursuant to Section
4.2 or 4.3; provided, however, that:

(a) each Interest Period for a Eurodollar
Tranche that would otherwise end on a day which
is not a Business Day shall end on the
immediately succeeding Business Day (unless
such immediately succeeding Business Day is the
first Business Day of a calendar month, in
which case such Interest Period shall end on
the immediately preceding Business Day);

(b) the Borrower may not select any
Interest Period which would end after the
Maturity Date;

(c) the Borrower may not specify any
Interest Period scheduled to end after any
Repayment Date set forth in Section 3.3.1
unless the aggregate principal amount of all
Base Rate Tranches and all Eurodollar Tranches
having Interest Periods ending prior to such
Repayment Date shall not be less than the
aggregate amount of the Installment due on such
Repayment Date and all unpaid Installments due
on any prior Repayment Date; and

(d) absent the timely selection of a new
Interest Period for a then outstanding
Eurodollar Tranche, or any part thereof, such
Eurodollar Tranche or such part, as the case
may be, shall, immediately upon the expiration
of such Interest Period, automatically and
without further action, be converted into a
Base Rate Tranche.
<PAGE>

- 50 -

SECTION 4.4.2. Conditions Precedent. No
portion of the outstanding principal amount of any
Loan may be continued as, or converted into, one or
more Eurodollar Tranches unless, on and as of the
requested date of continuation or conversion, all
of the conditions precedent set forth in Section
6.2 have been satisfied.

SECTION 4.4.3. Other Limitations. At all
times:

(a) the aggregate amount of all Tranches of
each Lender's Loan shall equal the outstanding
principal amount of such Lender's Loan;

(b) the aggregate principal amount of each
Group of Eurodollar Tranches shall be in an
integral multiple of $1,000,000;

(c) the total number of Eurodollar Tranches
in effect at any time shall not exceed twelve
(12); and

(d) each Lender shall at all times have a
Ratable share of each Group of Tranches, except
for any Group of Base Rate Tranches that
includes an Affected Tranche.

SECTION 4.5. Increased Costs.

(a) If (i) Regulation D of the F.R.S.
Board, or (ii) after the date hereof, the
adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change
therein or in any existing Applicable Law, or
any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any
Lender (or any Eurodollar Office of such
Lender) with any request or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) of any such
Governmental Authority:

(A) shall subject any Lender (or any
Eurodollar Office of such Lender) to any
tax, duty or other charge with respect to
its Eurodollar Tranches, its Note or its
obligation to make Eurodollar Tranches
available, or shall change the basis of
taxation of payments to any Lender of the
principal of or interest on its Eurodollar
Tranches or any other amounts due under
this Agreement in respect of its Eurodollar
Tranches or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Tranches available (except for
changes in the rate of tax on the overall
net income of such Lender or its Eurodollar
Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which
such Lender's principal executive office or
<PAGE>

- 51 -

Eurodollar Office is located); or

(B) shall impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve (including, without
limitation, any reserve imposed by the
F.R.S. Board), special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit
extended by any Lender (or any Eurodollar
Office of such Lender); or

(C) shall impose on any Lender (or its
Eurodollar Office) any other condition
affecting its Eurodollar Tranches, its Note
or its obligation to make Eurodollar
Tranches available;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to (or in the case of
Regulation D referred to above, to impose a
cost on) such Lender (or any Eurodollar Office
of such Lender) of making or maintaining any
Eurodollar Tranche, or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender
(or its Eurodollar Office) under this Agreement
or under its Note with respect thereto, then
upon demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall
pay directly to such Lender such additional
amount as will compensate such Lender for such
increased cost or such reduction.

(b) If any Lender shall reasonably
determine that the adoption or phase-in of any
Applicable Law regarding capital adequacy, or
any change therein or in any existing
Applicable Law, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any
Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Lender (or its Eurodollar
Office) or any Person controlling such Lender
with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of
law) of any such Governmental Authority, has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's or such controlling
Person's capital as a consequence of such
Lender's obligations hereunder (including,
without limitation, such Lender's Commitment)
to a level below that which such Lender or such
controlling Person could have achieved but for
such adoption, phase-in, change or compliance
(taking into consideration such Lender's or
such controlling Person's policies with respect
to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
such Lender or such controlling Person to be
material, then from time to time, upon demand
by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as
<PAGE>

- 52 -

will compensate such Lender or such controlling
Person for such reduction.

SECTION 4.6. Interest Rate Inadequate or
Unfair. If with respect to any Interest Period:

(a) deposits in Dollars (in the applicable
amounts) are not being offered to one or more
Lenders in the relevant market for such
Interest Period, or the Administrative Agent
otherwise determines (which determination shall
be binding and conclusive on the Borrower) that
by reason of circumstances affecting the
interbank eurodollar market, adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
the applicable Eurodollar Rate; or

(b) the Required Lenders advise the
Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate
(Reserve Adjusted) as determined by the
Administrative Agent will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
maintaining or funding Eurodollar Tranches for
such Interest Period, or that the maintaining
or funding of Eurodollar Tranches has become
impracticable as a result of an event occurring
after the date of this Agreement which in the
opinion of such Lenders materially affects
Eurodollar Tranches, then the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Lenders thereof and, so long as such
circumstances shall continue, (i) no Lender
shall thereafter have any obligation to fund or
make available Eurodollar Tranches and (ii) on
the last day of the current Interest Period for
any Eurodollar Tranche, such Tranche shall,
unless then repaid in full, automatically
convert to a Base Rate Tranche.

SECTION 4.7. Changes in Law Rendering
Eurodollar Tranches Unlawful. In the event that
the adoption or phase-in of any Applicable Law, or
any change therein or in any existing Applicable
Law or any change in the interpretation thereof by
any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, shall
make it (or in the good faith judgment of any
Lender cause a substantial question as to whether
it is) unlawful for any Lender to maintain or fund
Eurodollar Tranches, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower, the other Lenders and
the Administrative Agent and, so long as such
circumstances shall continue, (a) such Lender shall
thereafter have no obligation to fund or make
available Eurodollar Tranches (but shall fund Base
Rate Tranches concurrently with the making of the
Loans, or the continuation or conversion into
Eurodollar Tranches by the Lenders which are not so
affected, in each case in an amount equal to such
<PAGE>

- 53 -

Lender's Ratable share of all Eurodollar Tranches
that would be funded at such time in the absence of
such circumstances) and (b) on the last day of the
current Interest Period for any Eurodollar Tranche
of such Lender (or, in any event, if such Lender so
requests, on such earlier date as may be required
by the relevant Applicable Law), such Eurodollar
Tranche shall, unless then repaid in full,
automatically convert to a Base Rate Tranche. Each
Base Rate Tranche funded by a Lender which, but for
the circumstances described in the foregoing
sentence, would have been a Eurodollar Tranche (an
"Affected Tranche") shall, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, remain
outstanding for the same period as the Group of
Eurodollar Tranches of which such Affected Tranche
would have been part absent such circumstances.

SECTION 4.8. Funding Losses. The Borrower
hereby agrees that, upon demand by any Lender, the
Borrower will indemnify such Lender against any net
loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or
incur (including, without limitation, any net loss
or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
employment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such Lender to maintain or fund any Eurodollar
Tranche), as reasonably determined by such Lender,
as a result of (a) any payment, repayment,
prepayment or conversion of any Eurodollar Tranche
of such Lender on a date other than the last day of
an Interest Period for such Tranche (including any
conversion pursuant to Section 4.7) or (b) any
failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or
convert any Tranche on a date specified therefor in
a notice of borrowing pursuant to Section 3.1 or in
any Continuation/Conversion Notice pursuant to
Section 4.2 or 4.3. 

SECTION 4.9. Right of Lenders to Fund Through
Other Offices. Each Lender may, if it so elects,
fulfill its commitment as to any Eurodollar Tranche
by causing the Eurodollar Office of such Lender to
fund such Eurodollar Tranche, provided that in
such event for the purposes of this Agreement such
Tranche shall be deemed to have been funded by such
Lender and the obligation of the Borrower to repay
such Tranche shall nevertheless be to such Lender
and shall be deemed held by it, to the extent of
such Tranche, for the account of such Eurodollar
Office.

SECTION 4.10. Discretion of Lenders as to
Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender
shall be entitled to maintain and fund all or any
part of its Loan in any manner it sees fit, it
being understood, however, that for purposes of
this Agreement all determinations hereunder
(including determinations of any net loss or
<PAGE>

- 54 -

expense under Section 4.8) shall be made as if such
Lender had actually funded and maintained each
Eurodollar Tranche during each Interest Period for
such Tranche actually funded or requested by the
Borrower to be funded through the purchase of a
deposit on the first day of such Interest Period
having a principal amount equal to the principal
amount of such Tranche, having a maturity
corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing
an interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate for
such Interest Period.

SECTION 4.11. Conclusiveness of Statements;
Survival of Provisions. Demands made by any Lender
to the Borrower under Section 4.5 or 4.8 shall be
accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis
for the calculations of the amounts being claimed,
and a copy of such statement shall be furnished to
the Administrative Agent. Such statements, and all
other determinations and statements of any Lender
pursuant to Sections 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 or 4.8, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Lenders may use
reasonable averaging and attribution methods in
determining compensation under Sections 4.5 and
4.8, and the provisions of such sections shall
survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the
Notes and any termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE V

GUARANTIES

SECTION 5.1. Guaranty.

SECTION 5.1.1. Guaranty of Payment. Each of
the Principal Companies (in their capacities as
guarantors under this Article V, the Guarantors")
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guaranties to the Lenders the full and punctual
payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
scheduled repayment, required prepayment,
declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise
(including, without limitation, all amounts which
would have become due but for the operation of the
automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 362(a)), of the
Obligations, in accordance with their respective
terms, whether such Obligations are outstanding on
the date of this Agreement or arise or are incurred
at any time or times thereafter. The Guaranties
hereby made constitute guaranties of payment when

Without prejudice to any of the obligations of the

absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
covenants and agrees to cause each of the other

and to cure or make good promptly any Default which
may occur at any time or times.

SECTION 5.2. Guaranty Absolute. The
obligations of the Guarantors under Section 5.1.1
are and shall be construed as continuing, absolute
and unconditional guaranties of payment, and shall
remain in full force and effect, until all
Obligations have been paid in full in cash. The
Guarantors guarantee that the Obligations will be
paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, regardless
of any Applicable Law now or hereafter in effect in
any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of any Secured Party with respect thereto.
The liability of the Guarantors under the
Guaranties hereby made shall be absolute,

of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
any other agreement or Instrument relating to
any thereof or to any of the Obligations;

(b) any change in the corporate existence,
structure or ownership of any Transaction
Party, or any insolvency, bankruptcy,

Document;

(c) the failure of any Secured Party

(i) to assert any claim or

remedy against the Borrower, any

provisions of this Agreement or any

agreement or Instrument relating to
any thereof or under any Applicable
Law, or

(ii) to exercise any right or
remedy against any Collateral;

(d) any change in the time, manner or place
of payment of, or in any other term of, all or
any of the Obligations, or any other
compromise, renewal, extension, acceleration or
release with respect thereto, or any other
amendment to, rescission, waiver or other
modification of or any consent to departure
from any of the terms of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or any other Instrument
relating to any thereof;

(e) any increase, reduction, limitation,
impairment or termination of the Obligations
for any reason, including any claim of waiver,
release, surrender, alteration or compromise,
and any defense or setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason
of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness,
irregularity, compromise, or unenforceability
of, or any other event or occurrence affecting,
any of the Obligations (and the Guarantors
hereby waive any right to or claim of any such
defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or
termination);

(f) any exchange, release or non-perfection
of any Collateral, or any amendment to or
waiver or release of, or consent to departure
from any other guaranty held by any Secured
Party securing all or any of the Obligations;

(g) any defense, set-off or counterclaim
which may at any time be available to or be
asserted by the Borrower or any other
Transaction Party against any other Transaction
Party or against any Secured Party; or

(h) any other circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a suretyship or other
defense available to, or a legal or equitable
discharge of, the Borrower, any Guarantor, or
any other Transaction Party.

SECTION 5.3. Reinstatement, etc. The
Guarantors agree that the Guaranties hereby made
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as
the case may be, if at any time any payment (in
<PAGE>

- 57 -

whole or in part) of any of the Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any
Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

SECTION 5.4. Waiver. Each of the Guarantors
hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance and any other notice with respect to any
of the Obligations or its Guaranty and any
requirement that the Collateral Agent or any other
Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or insure
any Lien or any Property subject thereto or exhaust
any right or take any action against the Borrower,
any Guarantor, any Transaction Party or any other
Person or entity or any Collateral.

SECTION 5.5. Subordination of Subrogation
Rights. The rights which any Guarantor shall
acquire against any of the other Transaction
Parties as a consequence of making any payment
under its Guaranty are, in this Section 5.5,
collectively called the "Subrogation Rights." In
the event of any proceeding for the distribution,
division or application of all or any part of the
Property of any of the other Transaction Parties,
whether such proceeding be for the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of any of the other
Transaction Parties, a receivership, insolvency or
bankruptcy proceeding, an assignment for the
benefit of creditors, or a proceeding by or against
any of the other Transaction Parties for relief
under any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency
law, if all of the Obligations have not been paid
and satisfied in full at the time, the
Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably
authorized by such Guarantor at any such
proceeding:

(a) to enforce all of the Subrogation
Rights of such Guarantor, either in the name of
the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or in
the name of such Guarantor, by proof of debt,
proof of claim, suit or otherwise;

(b) to collect any Property of any of the
other Transaction Parties distributed or
applied by way of dividend or payment on
account of such Subrogation Rights, and to
apply the same, or the proceeds of any
realization thereof, towards the payment of the
Obligations until all the Obligations have been
paid and satisfied in full; and

(c) to vote all claims arising under or in
respect of all such Subrogation Rights.

So long as any Obligations remain unpaid, no
Guarantor shall take any action of any kind to
<PAGE>

- 58 -

enforce any of its Subrogation Rights, and no
Guarantor shall receive or accept from any Person
any payments or other distributions in respect of
any of its Subrogation Rights. Should any payment
on account of any of the Subrogation Rights be
received by any Guarantor, such payment shall be
delivered by such Guarantor forthwith to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties in the form received by such Guarantor,
except for the addition of any endorsement or
assignment necessary to effect transfer of all
rights therein to the Collateral Agent. Until so
delivered, each such payment shall be held by such
Guarantor in trust for the benefit of the Secured
Parties and shall not be commingled with any other
funds of such Guarantor.

Lender as set forth in this Article.

SECTION 7.1. Organization, etc. Each of the
Transaction Parties is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
makes such qualification necessary and where the
failure to so qualify could reasonably be expected
to have a Materially Adverse Effect, and has full

Transaction Parties has taken all necessary action,
corporate or otherwise, to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and
Ancillary Documents to be executed by it. The
execution, delivery and performance of each of the
Loan Documents and each of the Ancillary Documents
to which any Transaction Party is or is to be a
party on and as of the Effective Date will not
(except for Approvals which will have been already
made or obtained) require any Approval, will not
conflict with, result in any violation of, or
constitute any default under (a) any provision of
any Governing Document of any Transaction Party,
(b) any Contractual Obligation of any of the
Principal Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or

Companies, enforceable in accordance with its
terms. Each of the Loan Documents to which any of
the Transaction Parties is or is to be a party does
or will constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Transaction Party, enforceable
in accordance with its terms. The enforceability
of this Agreement and the Loan Documents against
the Transaction Parties shall be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws at the time in effect affecting the
enforceability of the rights of creditors
generally.

fairly (subject to normal year-end adjustments in
the case of the financial statements delivered
pursuant to clause (b)) the consolidated financial
condition of the corporations covered thereby as at
the dates thereof and the results of their
operations for the periods then ended. Neither

<PAGE>

- 73 -

projected consolidated statements of income for the
Fiscal Years ending on such dates, all of which
have been delivered to the Lenders prior to the
date of this Agreement (collectively, the
"Projections"), have been prepared based on the
assumptions accompanying them and reflect the best
good faith estimate of the Principal Companies of
the performance and financial condition of the
Principal Companies and their Subsidiaries for the
periods then ended based on such assumptions.

SECTION 7.6. Materially Adverse Effect. 

(a) For purposes of the Credit Extension to
be made on the Effective Date, no event or

which, individually or in the aggregate, have
had or are reasonably likely to have, a
Materially Adverse Effect.

(b) For purposes of Credit Extensions
requested to be made after the Effective Date,
no event or events have occurred since the

SECTION 7.7. Existing Indebtedness; Absence of
Default. With respect to each item of Indebtedness
listed in Section 8.2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule,
the Principal Companies have delivered to the
Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of
each Instrument evidencing such Indebtedness or
pursuant to which such Indebtedness was issued or

respect thereof), as the same is in effect on the
date hereof. Except as set forth in Section 8.2.2
of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Principal
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries is in
default in the payment of any such Indebtedness, or
in the performance of any obligation under any
Instrument evidencing such Indebtedness or pursuant

Subsidiaries or to which any of the Property of any
thereof is subject which

Materially Adverse Effect;

<PAGE>

- 74 -

Loan Document or to the Reorganization; or

(c) seeks to enjoin or otherwise prevent
the consummation of, or to recover any damages
or obtain relief as a result of, the
transactions contemplated by or in connection
with this Agreement, any other Loan Documents
or the Reorganization.

None of such pending or threatened proceedings has
a reasonable likelihood of having a Materially
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 7.9. Regulations G, U and X. None of
the Principal Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates is engaged principally,
or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying margin stock. None of the
proceeds of the Loans will be used for the purpose
of, or be made available by the Borrower in any
manner to any other Person to enable or assist such
Person in, directly or indirectly purchasing or
carrying margin stock. Terms for which meanings
are provided in F.R.S. Board Regulation G, U or X
or any regulations substituted therefor, as from
time to time in effect, are used in this Section
with such meanings.

SECTION 7.10. Government Regulation. None of
the Principal Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates is an "investment
company" or a "company controlled by an investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, or a "holding
company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company"
or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. No
Transaction Party is a Person prohibited from
acquiring or holding a Broadcasting Station by the
Communications Act, including (i) an alien or
representative of an alien, (ii) a corporation
organized under the laws of any foreign government,
(iii) any corporation of which any officer or
director is an alien or of which more than
one-fifth of the stock is owned of record or voted
by aliens or their representatives or by a foreign
government or representative thereof or by any
corporation organized under the laws of a foreign
country, and/or (iv) any corporation directly or
indirectly controlled by any other corporation of
which any officer or more than one-fourth of the
directors are aliens or of which more than
one-fourth of the stock is owned of record or voted
by aliens, their representatives, or by a foreign
government or representative thereof, or by any
corporation organized under the laws of a foreign
<PAGE>

- 75 -

country. Each Transaction Party is in compliance
with the Communications Act with regard to alien
control or ownership. None of the Transaction
Parties is subject to any Applicable Law that
regulates the incurring of Indebtedness for
Borrowed Money.

SECTION 7.11. Burdensome Agreements; Restricted
Payments.

(a) From and after the Effective Date, none
of the Principal Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries will be a party to any Instrument
or other agreement (other than the Loan
Documents and the Ancillary Documents) or
subject to any Applicable Law, Governing
Document or Contractual Obligation which could
have a Materially Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 7.11(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule fully and accurately describes, as of
the date of this Agreement, all (if any)
Restricted Payments made since December 23,
1992. 

SECTION 7.12. Taxes. Each of the Principal
Companies and each of their Subsidiaries has filed
all tax returns and reports required by Applicable
Law to have been filed by it and has paid all taxes
and governmental charges thereby shown to be owing,
except any such taxes or charges which are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and for which adequate reserves in accordance with
GAAP shall have been set aside on its books. No
tax Liens have been filed with respect to any of
the Principal Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries and, to the best knowledge of the
Principal Companies (after due inquiry), no claims
are being asserted with respect to any such taxes
or charges (and no basis exists for any such
claims), which Liens and claims, individually or in
the aggregate, could have a Materially Adverse
Effect. All tax liabilities are adequately
provided for on the books of the Principal
Companies and their Subsidiaries. The federal
income tax liabilities of the Principal Companies
and their Subsidiaries have been finally determined
by the Internal Revenue Service for all Fiscal
Years up to and including the 1987 Fiscal Year.

SECTION 7.13. Compliance with ERISA. All
Single Employer Plans are in substantial compliance
with ERISA; no Multiemployer Plan is insolvent or
in reorganization (each such term as defined for
purposes of Title IV of ERISA) or has notified the
Borrower, any Principal Company or any ERISA
Affiliate that it intends to terminate or has been
terminated; no Single Employer Plan has an
accumulated or waived funding deficiency or has
<PAGE>

- 76 -

applied for an extension of any amortization period
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code; none
of the Principal Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries and no ERISA Affiliate has incurred
any liability to or on account of a Single Employer
Plan pursuant to Section 4062, 4063, 4064 or a
Multiemployer Plan pursuant to Sections 515, 4201
or 4204 of ERISA; no proceedings have been
instituted to terminate any Plan; and no condition
exists which presents a material risk to any of the
Principal Companies or any of their Subsidiaries of
incurring a liability to or on account of a Plan
pursuant to any of the foregoing Sections of ERISA
or the Code. Except as set forth in Section 7.13
of the Disclosure Schedule, the aggregate present
value of all benefit liabilities (within the
meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA) of each Single
Employer Plan does not exceed the aggregate current
value of all assets of such Plan based upon the
most recent estimated actuarial data that has been
provided to the Principal Companies by the
consulting actuaries of such Plan, and there is no
withdrawal liability (and would be no withdrawal
liability assuming a complete withdrawal from all
such Plans) to any Multiemployer Plan. Each
employee welfare benefit plan (within the meaning
of Section 3(a) or 3(2)(B) of ERISA) maintained or
contributed to by any of the Principal Companies or
any of their Subsidiaries requires that no benefits
are due unless the event giving rise to the benefit
entitlement occurs prior to plan termination
(except as required by Title I, Part 6 of ERISA or
applicable state insurance laws). The Principal
Company or Subsidiary, as appropriate, may
terminate each such employee welfare benefit plan
at any time (or at any time subsequent to the
expiration of any applicable bargaining agreement)
in the discretion of the Principal Company or
Subsidiary, without liability to any Person.

SECTION 7.14. Labor Controversies. Except as
disclosed in Section 7.14 of the Disclosure
Schedule, there are no labor controversies pending
or, to the best knowledge of the Principal
Companies (after due inquiry), threatened against
any of the Principal Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries, which, if adversely determined, could
have a Materially Adverse Effect.

of GACC and its Subsidiaries.

the corporate structure of GACC and its
Subsidiaries immediately following the
Reorganization (the "Pro-forma Capital
Structure"). Each of the Subsidiaries
indicated as "Inactive" is inactive and will
remain inactive from and after the Effective
Date, meaning that such company has and will
have no Property other than its nominal
capitalization, has and will have no
liabilities, and is and will be conducting no
business.

Schedule accurately and completely lists, with
respect to each of the Principal Companies and
their Subsidiaries reflected on the Pro-Forma
Capital Structure, as of the Effective Date,

Stock of each such corporation, and the owners

Stock of GACC are listed) and (iii) the
business(es) in which each such corporation
will be engaged.

(d) All issued and outstanding shares of
Capital Stock of each of the Principal
Companies (other than GACC) and their
Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective
Date, will have been duly and validly issued,
fully-paid and non-assessable, and will be
owned as set forth in Section 7.15(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule free and clear of any Liens
or restrictions on transfer (except such as are
permitted by Section 8.2.3).

(e) From and after the Effective Date,
there will be no outstanding warrants, options,
contracts or commitments of any kind entitling
any Person to purchase or otherwise acquire any
Capital Stock of any of the Principal Companies
(other than GACC) or any of their Subsidiaries
nor will there be outstanding any Securities
(other than Class B Common Stock) which are
convertible into or exchangeable for any
Capital Stock of any of the Principal Companies
or any of their Subsidiaries. From and after
the Effective Date, there will be no
outstanding commitments, options, warrants,
calls or other agreements (whether written or
oral) binding on any of the Principal Companies
(other than GACC) or any of their Subsidiaries
to issue, sell, grant, transfer, assign,
mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of any
Capital Stock of any of the Principal Companies
<PAGE>

- 78 -

or any of their Subsidiaries (except such as
are permitted by Section 8.2.3).

SECTION 7.16. Ownership of Properties, Liens.
Section 7.16 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true, correct and complete description of all of
the real Property owned or leased by GACC and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date. Each
Principal Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
valid fee or leasehold interests in all of its
respective real Property and good and marketable
title to all of its respective material owned
personal Property, and none of such Property will
be subject to any Lien (except such as are
permitted by Section 8.2.3).

SECTION 7.17. Patents, Trademarks, etc. Each
Transaction Party owns and possesses all such
patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark
rights, trade names, trade name rights, service
marks, service mark rights and copyrights necessary
for the conduct of the businesses of such
Transaction Party as now conducted without,
individually or in the aggregate, any infringement
upon any proprietary or other rights of any other
Person. None of the Transaction Parties owns or
possesses any patents or patent rights, or any
federally registered copyrights. From and after
the Effective Date, all of the trademarks and
service marks of the Transaction Parties registered
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
will be identified in the Trademark Security
Agreement. 

SECTION 7.18. Reorganization; Accuracy of
Information. The Registration Statement accurately
describes in all material respects the terms and
conditions, including the tax and other
consequences, of the Reorganization and the Plan of
Reorganization. All factual information heretofore
or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of
GACC or any of its Subsidiaries in writing to any
Agent or any Lender for purposes of or in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby, including the Registration
Statement, is, and all other such factual
information hereafter furnished by or on behalf of
any Transaction Party to any Agent or any Lender
will be, true and accurate in every material
respect on the date as of which such information is
dated or certified, and not incomplete by omitting
to state any material fact necessary to make such
information not misleading.

SECTION 7.19. The Collateral Documents. The
provisions of the Collateral Documents will be,
from and after the Effective Date, effective to
create, in favor of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, legal, valid and
<PAGE>

- 79 -

enforceable Liens in all right, title and interest
of the Transaction Parties in any and all of the
Collateral described therein, securing the
Obligations from time to time outstanding. Each of
the Collateral Documents will create a fully
perfected Lien in all right, title and interest of
the Transaction Parties in the Collateral described
therein superior in right to any Liens, existing or

creditor of or purchaser from any Transaction
Party, or any other Person, may have against such

liability under any Environmental Laws, and
have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Materially Adverse Effect.

SECTION 7.21. Licenses and Approvals.

SECTION 10.1. Actions. Each Lender and the holder of
each Note hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, each
Managing Agent and the Collateral Agent to act on behalf of
such Lender or holder under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and, in the absence of other written instructions
from the Required Lenders received from time to time by the
Administrative Agent, either Managing Agent or the Collateral
Agent, as the case may be (with respect to which the
<PAGE>

- 119 -

Administrative Agent, either Managing Agent or the Collateral
Agent, as the case may be, agrees that it will, subject to
the next three sentences of this Section, comply in good
faith except to the extent that it is advised by counsel
that such compliance would be contrary to any Applicable
Law), to exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are
specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative
Agent, each Managing Agent or the Collateral Agent by the
terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as may be
reasonably incidental thereto. Each Lender agrees (which
agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement) to
indemnify each Agent, promptly upon demand, Ratably at the
time such demand is transmitted, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Indemnified
Costs") which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against such Agent, in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, including the reimbursement of any Agent for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel, amounts paid in settlement and
court costs) incurred by such Agent hereunder or in
connection herewith or in enforcing the obligations of the
Transaction Parties under this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, in all cases as to which such Agent is not
reimbursed by the Principal Companies; except for any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
which (a) a court of competent jurisdiction has found, in a
final nonappealable order, resulted directly and primarily by
reason of such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct
or (b) have been reimbursed by the Principal Companies
pursuant to Section 12.4. No Agent shall be required to take
any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or to
prosecute or defend any suit in respect of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, unless indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any Indemnified Costs.
If any indemnity in favor of any Agent shall become impaired,
such Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease to do
the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity
is given. Any of the Agents may delegate their duties
hereunder to Affiliates, agents or attorneys-in-fact selected
in good faith by the delegating Agent.

SECTION 10.2. Exculpation. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents, none of the Agents shall have
any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist
against any Agent. Neither the Agents nor any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents
(collectively, the "Related Parties") shall be liable to any
Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in
connection herewith or therewith, except for its own willful

misconduct or gross negligence, nor shall any Agent or any of
the Related Parties be responsible for any recitals or
representations or warranties herein or therein, or for the
effectiveness, enforceability, validity, or due execution of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor shall any
Agent or any of the Related Parties be obligated to make any
inquiry respecting the performance by the Transaction Parties
of their obligations hereunder or thereunder, or to inspect
the Properties, books or records of the Transaction Parties.
The Agents shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel
concerning legal matters and upon any notice, consent,
certificate, statement, or writing which it believes to be
genuine and to have been presented by a proper Person. The
Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders (or, to the extent this Agreement requires a higher
percentage, such higher percentage), and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the
Obligations. The Agents shall be fully justified in failing
or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, to the extent
this Agreement requires a higher percentage, such higher
percentage) as it deems appropriate. 

SECTION 10.3. Successor. Subject to the appointment

Borrower, appoint another Lender which is a commercial
banking institution or trust institution having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 as a successor
Administrative Agent, Managing Agent or Collateral Agent, as
the case may be. If the Required Lenders do not make such
appointment within ten days, the resigning or removed
Administrative Agent, Managing Agent or Collateral Agent, as
the case may be, shall, upon consultation with the Borrower,
appoint a new Administrative Agent, Managing Agent or
Collateral Agent, as the case may be, from among the Lenders
which are commercial banking or trust institutions having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or, if
no Lender accepts such appointment, from among all other
commercial banking institutions or trust institutions having
a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative
Agent, Managing Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may
be, such successor Administrative Agent, Managing Agent or
Collateral Agent shall thereupon become the Administrative
Agent, Managing Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder and under
the applicable Loan Documents and shall be entitled to
receive from the prior Administrative Agent, Managing Agent
or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, such documents of
transfer and assignment as it may reasonably request, and the

right individually to seek to realize upon any security
granted by or guaranty provided by any Collateral Document,

may be exercised by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of
the Lenders, the Collateral Agent, the Managing Agents and
the Administrative Agent upon the terms of the Collateral
Documents.

SECTION 10.5. Loans by Agents. Any Lender which may at
any time be acting as Administrative Agent, Managing Agent or
Collateral Agent and as a Lender hereunder, shall have the
same rights and powers with respect to any Loans made by it
and any Notes held by it as any Lender and may exercise the
same as if it were not the Administrative Agent, Managing
Agent or Collateral Agent, and the term "Lender" and, when
appropriate, "holder", shall include any Lender who is then
an Agent.

SECTION 10.6. Credit Decisions. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently of the Administrative
Agent, each Managing Agent, the Collateral Agent and each
other Lender, and based on the financial information referred
to in Sections 7.4 and 7.5 and such other documents,
information, and investigations as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit decision to make its Commitment and its
Loan. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will,
independently of the Administrative Agent, each Managing
Agent, the Collateral Agent and each other Lender, and based
on such documents, information, and investigations as it
shall deem appropriate at any time, continue to make its own
credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising from time
to time any rights and privileges available to it under this
Agreement, the Collateral Documents, the Notes or the other
Loan Documents.

Agent. The Administrative Agent will distribute to each

business and in accordance with Applicable Law, sell to one
or more Participants participating interests in any Loan
owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, or any
other interest of such Lender under this Agreement and under
the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a
Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such

parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender
shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof,
such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and such Lender shall retain the
sole right to enforce the Obligations of the Borrower
relating to the Loans and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement.
It is understood that nothing in the prior sentence or
elsewhere in this Section 11.1.1 shall prohibit a Lender from
agreeing with any Participant that such Lender will not take
any action that would require approval of all of the Lenders
under Section 12.14 without the consent of such Participant.
Each Lender hereby agrees that it will not agree with any
Participant that it will not take any action without such
Participant's consent unless such action would require
approval of all Lenders under Section 12.14. 

SECTION 11.1.2. Participant's Right of Setoff in
Certain Cases. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be deemed to have all rights of set-off and bankers'
lien provided by Applicable Law in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement
and any Note to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender
under this Agreement or any Note, provided that such
Participant shall only be entitled to such right of setoff if
it shall have agreed, for the benefit of the Lenders and
holders of Notes, in the agreement pursuant to which it shall
have acquired its participating interest to purchase from the
<PAGE>

- 123 -

Lenders and holders of Notes such participations in the Notes
held by them as shall be necessary to cause such Participant
to share the amount recovered in exercising such right of
set-off or bankers' lien pro rata in accordance with the
aggregate unpaid principal and interest on the Loans held by
each of them.

SECTION 11.1.3. Rights of Participants. The Borrower
also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.7, 4.5, 4.8 and 12.4 with respect to
its participation in the Loans outstanding from time to time
and all amounts to which any Participant is entitled
thereunder shall be paid by the Borrower directly to the
Lender; provided, that no Participant shall be entitled to
receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the
transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by
such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such
transfer occurred.

SECTION 11.2. Assignments by Lenders.

SECTION 11.2.1. Assignments. During the Initial
Syndication Period, the Managing Agents may, for their
benefit as Lenders and the benefit of any other Lender that
informs the Managing Agents of its desire to assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents during such period, assign and transfer to any
one or more additional banks or financial institutions
("Purchasing Lender"), all or any part of such Assigning
Lender's rights and obligations (including Commitments) under
this Agreement and the Notes (which assignments and transfers
shall be, as nearly as practicable, and permitting customary
rounding of such assignments and transfers, on a pro rata
basis as to the rights and obligations of all such Lenders).
After the Initial Syndication Period, any Lender (any such
Lender (including the Managing Agents, as Lenders, being
referred to herein as an "Assigning Lender"), may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with
Applicable Law, sell to any other Lender or any Affiliate of
such Assigning Lender and, with the consent of the Managing
Agents (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to one
or more other Purchasing Lenders all or any part of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes.
Any such assignment and transfer ("Assignment") shall be made
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit R attached hereto (an
"Assignment and Acceptance Agreement"), executed by such
Purchasing Lender and such Assigning Lender (and, in the case
of a Purchasing Lender that is not then a Lender or an
Affiliate thereof, by the Administrative Agent) and delivered
to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording
in the Register (as hereinafter defined); provided, however,
that (a) the aggregate amount of Loans of the Assigning
Lender being assigned pursuant to any such Assignment after
the Initial Syndication Period shall in no event be less
than $5,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 (or, if less, the entire remaining amount of such
Lender's Loan), and (b) each such Assignment shall be of a
<PAGE>

- 124 -

constant, and not a varying, percentage of all of the
Assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. From and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, which effective
date must be at least five (5) Business Days after the
execution and delivery of such Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement to the Administrative Agent and (if required) the
acceptance of such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement by the
Administrative Agent (the "Transfer Effective Date"): (i) the
Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to
the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder with respect to the Loans as set forth therein, and
(ii) the Assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment of the entire remaining amount of
an Assigning Lender's Loans, such Assigning Lender shall
cease to be a party hereto).

SECTION 11.2.2. Effect of Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement. Each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement duly
executed and delivered in compliance with the foregoing
provisions of Section 11.2.1 shall be deemed to amend this
Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to
reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender as a Lender
hereunder and the resulting adjustment of Percentages.

SECTION 11.2.3. Delivery of New Notes By Borrower
Following Assignment. In the case of any Assignment under
Section 11.2.1 after the Effective Date, within five (5)
Business Days after the Transfer Effective Date determined
pursuant to the applicable Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement and Section 11.2.1, the Borrower, at its own
expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent, against surrender of the Note of the Assigning Lender
to the Administrative Agent, a new Note to the order of the
Purchasing Lender in an amount equal to the Loans assigned to
it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and,
if the Assigning Lender has retained Loans hereunder, a new
Note to the order of the Assigning Lender in a principal
amount equal to the Loans retained by it hereunder. Such new
Notes shall be dated the Transfer Effective Date (or such
other date as may be agreed to by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Assigning Lender and the Purchasing
Lender) and shall otherwise be in the form of the Notes
replaced thereby. The Notes surrendered by the Assigning
Lender shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower marked "cancelled."

SECTION 11.2.4. Administrative Agent's Maintenance of
Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its
address a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement
delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender from time
to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in
the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders
<PAGE>

- 125 -

may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
as the owner of the Loans recorded therein for all purposes
of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, any Managing Agent, the
Collateral Agent or any Lender at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

SECTION 11.2.5. Actions of Administrative Agent;
Fees. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement executed by an Assigning Lender and Purchasing
Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing Lender that is not
then a Lender or an Affiliate thereof, by the Administrative
Agent), together with (in the case of a Purchasing Lender
that is not then a Lender or an Affiliate thereof) payment by
the Purchasing Lender to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Administrative Agent of a registration and
processing fee of $2,500, the Administrative Agent shall (a)
promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (b)
on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto
and Section 11.2.1 record the information contained therein
in the Register and (c) give notice of such acceptance and
recordation to each of the Lenders and the Borrower.

SECTION 11.2.6. Assigning Lender, Purchasing Lender,
and Other Parties, Confirmations and Agreements. By
executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance
Agreement, the Assigning Lender thereunder and the Purchasing
Lender thereunder shall confirm to and agree with each other
and the other parties hereto as follows: (a) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, such
Assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,

pursuant hereto; (c) such Purchasing Lender confirms that it
has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies
of such financial statements and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment

time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement; (e) such Purchasing
Lender appoints and authorizes the Managing Agents and the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement or

Collateral Documents as are delegated to the Collateral Agent
by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.

SECTION 11.3. Disclosure of Information. The Principal
Companies authorize each Lender to disclose to any
Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and
any prospective Transferee any and all information in such
Lender's possession concerning the Principal Companies which

expenses actually incurred in connection therewith or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby (irrespective of whether

and the Series B Notes and the related Trustee's certificate of
authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B,
both of which exhibits are part of this Indenture. The Notes may
have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock
exchange rule or usage. The Company and the Trustee shall
approve the form of the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes and
any notation, legend or endorsement on them. Each Note shall be
dated the date of its authentication. The Notes shall be in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof.

The terms and provisions contained in the Notes shall
constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this
Indenture and to the extent applicable, the Company and the
Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this Indenture,
expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound
thereby.

Section 2.2 Execution and Authentication.

Two Officers of the Company (each of whom shall have been
duly authorized by all requisite corporate actions) shall sign
each Note for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. If
an Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that
office at the time the Note is authenticated, the Note shall
nevertheless be valid. The Company's seal shall be reproduced on
each Note.

A Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual
signature of the Trustee, and the Trustee's signature shall be
conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under
this Indenture. The form of Trustee's certificate of
authentication to be borne by the Series A Notes and Series B
Notes shall be substantially as set forth in Exhibit A and
Exhibit B, respectively. The Trustee may appoint an
authenticating agent (the "Authenticating Agent") acceptable to
the Company to authenticate Notes. Unless limited by the terms
of such appointment, an Authenticating Agent may authenticate
Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this
Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes
authentication by such agent. An Authenticating Agent has the
same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or any of its
Affiliates.

27
<PAGE>

With respect to the sale and issuance of the Initial Notes,
the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a written order signed by two
Officers of the Company, authenticate (i) Series A Notes for
issuance on the Issue Date up to $200,000,000 and (ii) Series B
Notes from time to time for issue only in an exchange pursuant to
the Registration Rights Agreement for a like principal amount of
Series A Notes. With respect to the sale and issuance of
Additional Notes, the Trustee shall, upon receipt of (A) an
Officers' Certificate to the effect that the issuance of such
Additional Notes is permitted by this Indenture, including
Section 4.7 hereof, and (B) a written order signed by two
Officers of the Company, authenticate Series A or Series B Notes
as specified in such order. In no case shall the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Notes exceed $250,000,000 at any
time, except as provided in Section 2.7.

Section 2.3 Registrar and Paying Agent.

The Company shall maintain an office or agency (the
"Registrar") where Notes may be presented or surrendered for
registration of transfer or for exchange and an office or agency
(the "Paying Agent") where Notes may be presented or surrendered
for payment. The Registrar shall keep a register of the Notes
and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one
or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. The term "Paying Agent"
includes any additional paying agent. The Company may change the
Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without prior notice to
any Holder. The Company shall notify the Trustee and the Trustee
shall notify the Holders of the name and address of any Agent not
a party to this Indenture. The Company shall enter into an
appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this
Indenture, and such agreement shall incorporate the provisions of
the TIA and implement the provisions of this Indenture that
relate to such Agent.

The Company initially appoints Securities Transfer Company
of Cincinnati, Ohio as Registrar, Paying Agent and agent for
service of notices and demands in connection with the Notes. The
Company or any of its Affiliates may act as Paying Agent,
Registrar or co-registrar. If the Company fails to appoint or
maintain a Registrar and/or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act
as such, and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation in
accordance with Section 7.7.

Section 2.4 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.

The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the
Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in
trust for the Holders' benefit or the Trustee all assets the
Paying Agent holds for the redemption or purchase of the Notes or
for the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest

28
<PAGE>

on, the Notes (whether such assets have been distributed to it by
the Company or any other obligor on the Notes), and will notify
the Trustee of any default by the Company (or any other obligor
on the Notes) in providing the Paying Agent with sufficient funds
to redeem or purchase Notes or make any payment on the Notes as
and to the extent required to be redeemed, purchased or paid
under the terms of this Indenture. While any such default
continues, the Trustee may require the Paying Agent to pay all
money it holds to the Trustee and to account for any assets
distributed. The Company at any time may require the Paying
Agent to pay all money it holds to the Trustee and to account for
any assets disbursed. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent (if other than the Company or any of its Affiliates)
shall have no further liability for the money it delivered to the
Trustee. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries acts as
Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust
fund for the Holders' benefit all money it holds as Paying Agent.

Section 2.5 Holder Lists.

The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is
reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of
the names and addresses of Holders and shall otherwise comply
with Section 312(a) of the TIA. If the Trustee is not the
Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, at least 7
Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other
times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form
and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require that
sets forth the names and addresses of, and the aggregate
principal amount of Notes held by, each Holder, and the Company
shall otherwise comply with Section 312(a) of the TIA.

Section 2.6 Transfer and Exchange.

When Notes are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar
with a request to register a transfer or to exchange them for an
equal principal amount of Notes of other authorized 
denominations, the Registrar or co-registrar shall register the
transfer or make the exchange if its requirements for such
transaction are met; provided, however, that any Note presented
or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be
duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Registrar or co-registrar and the
Trustee duly executed by the Holder of such note or by its
attorney duly authorized in writing. To permit registrations of
transfers and exchanges, the Company shall issue, and the Trustee
shall authenticate, Notes at the Registrar's request.

Neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required to
issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Note (i) during a
period beginning at the opening of business on the day that the
Trustee receives notice of any redemption from the Company

29
<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 3.3 and ending at the close of business on
the date the notice of redemption is sent to Holders, (ii)
selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part may be
transferred or exchanged, and (iii) during an Offer if such Note
is tendered pursuant to such Offer and not withdrawn.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted
herein), but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable
in connection therewith (other than any such transfer tax or
similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to
Section 2.10, 3.6 or 9.5, which the Company shall pay).

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any
Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Company may deem and treat
the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute
owner of such Note (whether or not such Note shall be overdue and
notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing on
such Note made by anyone other than the Company, the Registrar or
any co-registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of
principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, such Note and
for all other purposes, and notice to the contrary shall not
affect the Trustee, any Agent or the Company.

Section 2.7 Replacement Notes.

If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, or if
the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the
Company shall issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a
written order signed by two Officers of the Company, authenticate
a replacement Note if the Trustee's requirements are met, and
each such replacement Note shall be an additional obligation of
the Company. If the Trustee or the Company requires, the Holder
must supply an indemnity bond that is sufficient in the judgment
of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the
Trustee, or any Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer
if a Note is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge
for its reasonable expenses in replacing a Note.

Section 2.8 Outstanding Notes.

The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes the
Trustee has authenticated except for those it has cancelled,
those delivered to it for cancellation, and those described in
this Section 2.8 as not outstanding. If a Note is replaced
pursuant to Section 2.7 (other than a mutilated Note surrendered
for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee
receives proof satisfactory to it that a bona fide purchaser
holds the replaced Note. A mutilated Note ceases to be

30
<PAGE>

outstanding upon surrender of such Note and replacement thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof. If the entire principal of, and
premium, if any, and accrued interest on, any Note is considered
paid under Section 4.1, it ceases to be outstanding and interest
on it ceases to accrue. Subject to Section 2.9, a Note does not
cease to be outstanding because the Company or any Affiliate of
the Company holds such Note.

Section 2.9 Treasury Notes.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal
amount of Notes have concurred in any directions, waiver or
consent, Notes owned by the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Company shall be considered as though they are
not outstanding; provided, however, that for the purposes of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that the
Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Notes that the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company offers to purchase or acquires pursuant
to an exchange offer, tender offer or otherwise shall not be
deemed to be owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company
until legal title to such Notes passes to the Company or such
Affiliate, as the case may be.

Section 2.10 Temporary Notes.

Until definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the Company
may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Notes. 
Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of definitive
Notes but may have variations that the Company considers
appropriate for temporary Notes. Without unreasonable delay, the
Company shall prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written
order signed by two Officers of the Company, shall authenticate
definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. Until such
exchange, temporary Notes shall be entitled to the same rights,
benefits and privileges as definitive Notes.

Section 2.11 Cancellation.

The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for
cancellation. The Registrar, any co-registrar, the Paying Agent,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall forward to the Trustee any
Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange,
replacement, payment (including all Notes called for redemption
and all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to an Offer) or
cancellation, and the Trustee shall cancel all such Notes and
shall destroy all cancelled Notes (subject to the record
retention requirements of the Exchange Act) and deliver a
certificate of their destruction to the Company unless, by
written order signed by two Officers of the Company, the Company
shall direct that cancelled Notes be returned to it. The Company

31
<PAGE>

may not issue new Notes to replace any Notes that have been
cancelled by the Trustee or that have been delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation. If the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company acquires any Notes (other than by redemption pursuant to
Section 3.7 or an Offer pursuant to Section 4.12 or 4.13), such
acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of
the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until such
Notes are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to
this Section 2.11.

Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest.

If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the
Notes, it shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner
plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted
interest, to Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each
case at the rate provided in the Notes and Section 4.1. The
Company shall, with the Trustee's consent, fix or cause to be
fixed each such special record date and payment date. At least
15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, at the
request of the Company, the Trustee in the name of, and at the
expense of, the Company) shall mail a notice that states the
special record date, the related payment date and the amount of
interest (including interest, if any, on the defaulted interest)
to be paid.

Section 2.13 Record Date.

The record date for purposes of determining the identity of
holders of Notes entitled to vote or consent to any action by
vote or consent authorized or permitted under this Indenture
shall be the later of 10 days prior to the first solicitation of
such consent or the date of the most recent list of Holders
furnished to the Trustee prior to such solicitation.

Section 2.14 CUSIP Number.

A "CUSIP" number will be printed on the Notes, and the
Trustee shall use the CUSIP number in notices of redemption,
purchase or exchange as a convenience to Holders, provided that
any such notice may state that no representation is made as to
the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number printed in the
notice or on the Notes and that reliance may be placed only on
the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The
Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the
CUSIP number.

additional information that the Trustee reasonably requests in
connection with any redemption or Offer.

Section 3.2 Selection of Notes to be Redeemed or Purchased.

If less than all outstanding Notes are to be redeemed or if
less than all Notes tendered pursuant to an Offer are to be
accepted for payment, the Company shall select the outstanding
Notes to be redeemed or accepted for payment in compliance with
the requirements of the principal national securities exchange,
if any, on which the Notes are listed or, if the Notes are not
listed on a securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or
by any other method that the Trustee deems fair and appropriate;
provided, however, that if any Additional Notes are outstanding,
such selection shall be effected in such a manner as to ensure
that the ratio of the outstanding principal amount of the Initial

33
<PAGE>

Notes and the ratio of the outstanding principal amount of
Additional Notes, respectively, to the sum of the outstanding
principal amount of the Initial Notes and Additional Notes prior
to such selection is equal to such ratios after such selection. 
If the Company elects to mail notice of a redemption to Holders,
the Trustee shall, at least 5 days prior to the date notice of
redemption is to be mailed, (i) select the Notes to be redeemed
from Notes outstanding not previously called for redemption, and
(ii) promptly notify the Company of the names of each Holder of
Notes selected for redemption, the principal amount of Notes held
by each such Holder and the principal amount of such Holder's
Notes that are to be redeemed. If less than all Notes tendered
pursuant to an Offer are to be accepted for payment, the Trustee
shall select on or prior to the Purchase Date for such Offer the
Notes to be accepted for payment; provided, however, that if any
Additional Notes are outstanding, such selection shall be
effected in such a manner as to ensure that the ratio of the
outstanding principal amount of the Initial Notes and the ratio
of the outstanding principal amount of Additional Notes,
respectively, to the sum of the outstanding principal amount of
the Initial Notes and Additional Notes prior to such selection is
equal to such ratios after such selection. The Trustee shall
select for redemption or purchase Notes or portions of Notes in
principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples of $1,000;
except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are selected for
redemption or purchase, the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, may
be redeemed or purchased. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called
for redemption or tendered pursuant to an Offer also apply to
portions of Notes called for redemption or tendered pursuant to
an Offer.

Section 3.3 Notice of Redemption.

(a) At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before
any Redemption Date, the Company shall mail by first class mail
to each such Holder's registered address a notice of redemption
to each Holder of Notes or portions thereof that are to be
redeemed. With respect to any redemption of Notes, the notice
shall identify the Notes or portions thereof to be redeemed and
shall state: (1) the Redemption Date; (2) the Redemption Price
for the Notes and the amount of unpaid and accrued interest on
such Notes as of the date of redemption; (3) if any Note is being
redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such
Note to be redeemed and that, after the Redemption Date, upon
surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued; (4) the name and
address of the Paying Agent; (5) that Notes called for redemption
must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption
Price for, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, such Notes;
(6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption

34
<PAGE>

payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue
on and after the Redemption Date and the only remaining right of
the Holders of such Notes is to receive payment of the Redemption
Price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Notes redeemed;
and (7) if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the
identification of the particular Notes (or portion thereof) to be
redeemed, as well as the aggregate principal amount of Notes to
be redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be
outstanding after such partial redemption.

(b) At the Company's request, the Trustee shall (at
the Company's expense) give the notice of any redemption to
Holders; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to the
Trustee, at least 10 days prior to the date that notice of the
redemption is to be mailed to Holders, an Officers' Certificate
that (i) requests the Trustee to give notice of the redemption to
Holders, (ii) sets forth the information to be provided to
Holders in the notice of redemption, as set forth in the
preceding paragraph, and (iii) sets forth the aggregate principal
amount of Notes to be redeemed and the amount of accrued and
unpaid interest thereon as of the redemption date. If the
Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall, concurrently
with any such request, cause the Registrar to deliver to the
Trustee a certificate (upon which the Trustee may rely) setting
forth the name of, the address of, and the aggregate principal
amount of Notes held by, each Holder; provided further that any
such Officers' Certificate may be delivered to the Trustee on a
date later than permitted under this Section 3.3(b) if such later
date is acceptable to the Trustee.

Section 3.4 Effect of Notice of Redemption.

Once notice of redemption is mailed to the Holders, Notes
called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption
Date at the Redemption Price. Upon surrender to the Trustee or
the Paying Agent, the Notes called for redemption shall be paid
at the Redemption Price.

Section 3.5 Deposit of Redemption Price.

(a) On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company
shall deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the
Redemption Price of, and accrued interest on, all Notes to be
redeemed on that date. After any Redemption Date, the Trustee or
the Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Company any money
that the Company deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent
in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the Redemption Price
of, and accrued interest on, all Notes to be redeemed.

(b) If the Company complies with the preceding
paragraph, unless the Company defaults in the payment of such
Redemption Price interest on the Notes to be redeemed will cease

35
<PAGE>

to accrue on such Notes on the applicable Redemption Date,
whether or not such Notes are presented for payment. If a Note
is redeemed on or after an interest record date but on or prior
to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid
interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was
registered at the close of business on such record date. If any
Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender
for redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply
with the preceding paragraph, interest will be paid on the unpaid
principal, premium, if any, and interest from the redemption date
until such principal, premium and interest is paid, at the rate
of interest provided in the Notes and Section 4.1.

Section 3.6 Notes Redeemed in Part.

Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the
Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate for the
Holder at the Company's expense a new Note equal in principal
amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered.

Section 3.7 Optional Redemption.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.7,
the Notes may not be redeemed at the option of the Company prior
to February 15, 1999. Thereafter, the Notes will be subject to
redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at
the Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal
amount of the Notes) set forth below, plus any accrued and unpaid
interest to the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-

Indenture; (ii) the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes
to be redeemed pursuant to an Asset Sale Redemption will be

Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the Company shall
pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the

Agent money in immediately available funds designated for and
sufficient to pay such principal, premium or interest; provided,
however, that principal, premium or interest shall not be
considered paid within the meaning of this Section 4.1 if money
intended to pay such principal, premium or interest is held by
the Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of Senior
Indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of Article 10. The
Paying Agent shall return to the Company, no later than five days
following the date of payment, any money (including accrued
interest) that exceeds the amount then due and payable on the

the Officers of the Company signing such certificate, and (iii)
that to the best knowledge of each Officer signing such
certificate, (a) the Company has kept, observed, performed and

Default or Event of Default occurred, describing all such
Defaults or Events of Default of which each such Officer may have
knowledge and what action the Company has taken or proposes to

41
<PAGE>

Company's independent public accountants (who shall be a firm of
established national reputation reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee) that in making the examination necessary for
certification of such financial statements nothing has come to
their attention that would lead them to believe that the Company
has violated any provisions of Sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9,
4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.15 or Article 5, or if any such
violation has occurred, specifying the nature and period of
existence thereof, it being understood that such accountants
shall not be liable directly or indirectly to any Person for any
failure to obtain knowledge of any such violation.

The Company will, so long as any of the Notes are
outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, promptly after any Officer
of the Company becomes aware of (i) any Default or Event of
Default, or (ii) any default or event of default under any other

so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any
stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time
hereafter in force, that might affect the covenants or the
performance of its obligations under this Indenture and the
Notes; and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so)
hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law,
and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law,

a fairness opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor) the
aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments (excluding all
payments, investments, redemptions, repurchases, retirements and
other acquisitions described in clause (ii) of Section 4.5(b))

Person that is not a Subsidiary, which Indebtedness is
outstanding at the time such Person is acquired by the Company or
a Subsidiary or becomes, or is merged into or consolidated with,
a Subsidiary, shall be deemed to have been Incurred by the
Company at the time such Acquired Person becomes, or is merged
into or consolidated with, a Subsidiary.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 4.7(a) and in addition to
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under Section 4.7(c), the
Company (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.15) or

the provisions of this clause (iii) shall no longer be
applicable to such Indebtedness and such Indebtedness shall
be deemed to have been Incurred by the Company at the time
of such transfer or other disposition;

(iv) Refinancing Indebtedness with respect to
Indebtedness that was Incurred prior to the Issue Date or,
if incurred after the Issue Date, was Incurred in compliance
with the provisions of this Indenture; provided, however,
that (A) the principal amount of such Refinancing

renewed, replaced, substituted, defeased or refunded (plus
the amount of fees, costs and expenses incurred and the
amount of any premium, penalties, breakage costs and other
similar amounts required to be paid in connection with such

any premium reasonably determined by the Company as

refunded; (2) not have a final scheduled maturity earlier
than the final scheduled maturity of the Indebtedness being
extended, refinanced, replaced, renewed, substituted,
defeased or refunded; (3) not permit redemption at the
option of the holder earlier than the earliest date of
redemption at the option of the holder of the Indebtedness
being extended, refinanced, renewed, replaced, substituted,
defeased or refunded; and (4) rank no more senior or be at
least as subordinated, as the case may be, in right of
payment to the Notes as the Indebtedness being extended,
refinanced, replaced, renewed, substituted, defeased or
refunded; provided, further, that the limitations contained
in this clause (iv) shall not preclude the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries from Incurring additional Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred at the time under Section 4.7(b) or
any other clause of this Section 4.7(c), notwithstanding
that such additional Indebtedness would fall within the
definition of "Refinancing Indebtedness;"

the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, make any
Investment in or enter into any contract, agreement,
understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or for the direct
or indirect benefit of, an Affiliate of the Company or of any
Subsidiary of the Company (each, including any series of
transactions with one or more Affiliates, an "Affiliate
Transaction"), unless such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that
are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Subsidiary
than those that could have been obtained at that time in a
comparable transaction by the Company or such Subsidiary with an
unrelated Person.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall enter into an Affiliate Transaction involving or having a
potential aggregate value of more than $1,000,000, other than

which firm is not receiving any contingent fee or other
consideration directly or indirectly related to the successful
completion of the Affiliate Transaction, to the effect that the
proposed Affiliate Transaction is fair to the Company from a
financial point of view.

Indenture, the execution by the Company or any of its

Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries provided such transactions are not
otherwise prohibited by this Indenture, including, but not

obligations of such Subsidiary to the Company under the Tax
Sharing Agreement.

Section 4.9 Limitation on Liens.

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, Incur, assume, suffer to exist, create or
otherwise cause to be effective any Lien on any asset now owned
or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom or
assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom to secure
any Indebtedness except: (i) Permitted Liens, (ii) Liens
existing as of the Issue Date (and any extension, renewal or
replacement Liens upon the same Property subject to such Liens,
provided the principal amount of Indebtedness secured by each
Lien constituting such an extension, renewal or replacement Lien
shall not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness secured by

47

the Lien theretofore existing, plus amounts described in Section
4.7(iv)(A) with respect to permitted Refinancing Indebtedness),
(iii) Liens securing all or any Senior Indebtedness; (iv) Liens
securing Indebtedness of any Subsidiary of the Company, provided
that (A) such Liens are limited to Property or assets of such

Subsidiary other than Senior Bank Debt; (v) Liens replacing,
extending or renewing, in whole or in part, any Lien described in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), including in connection
with any refinancing of the Indebtedness, in whole or in part,

provided that if any such clauses limit the amount secured by or
the Property or assets subject to such Liens, no such
replacement, extension or renewal shall increase the amount of
Indebtedness or the Property or assets subject to such Liens and
(vi) any other Lien securing Indebtedness Incurred in compliance
with Section 4.7, if the Notes are equally and ratably secured by
the Property or assets subject to such Lien, provided that if the
Company creates any Lien under this clause (vi) on its Property
or assets to secure any Subordinated Indebtedness, the Lien
securing such Subordinated Indebtedness shall be subordinated and

The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Significant
Subsidiaries to, pay or discharge, before the same shall become
delinquent, (i) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges
(including withholding taxes and any penalties, interest and
additions to taxes) levied or imposed upon it or any of its
Subsidiaries or properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) all lawful claims for labor, materials and
supplies that, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon the
property of it or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or
cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge
or claim if either (a) the amount, applicability or validity
thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and an adequate reserve has been established therefor
to the extent required by GAAP or (b) the failure to make such
payment or effect such discharge (together with all other such
failures) would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital
Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by,
its profits owned by, or pay any Indebtedness owed to, the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, (b) make loans or
advances to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, or (c)
transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, except for such Payment Restrictions
or encumbrances existing under or by reasons of: (i) any
instrument governing Indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries not Incurred in violation of this Indenture,
provided that such Payment Restrictions or encumbrances are no
more restrictive in the aggregate with respect to such dividends
and other payments than those contained in the Subsidiary Debt
Documents as in effect on the Issue Date, (ii) applicable law,
(iii) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a
Person acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in
effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such
Indebtedness was Incurred in contemplation of or in connection
with such acquisition), provided that such restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the Property or assets of any
Person, other than the Acquired Person, (iv) non-assignment
provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practices, (v) instruments
governing purchase money Indebtedness for Property acquired in
the ordinary course of business that only impose restrictions on
the Property so acquired, (vi) any agreement for the sale or
disposition of the Capital Stock or assets of such Subsidiary,
provided that such restriction is only applicable to such
Subsidiary or assets, as applicable, (vii) Refinancing
Indebtedness permitted under this Indenture with respect to
Indebtedness described in clauses (iii), (iv) or (v), provided
that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such

Section 4.12 Change of Control.

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (such
date being the "Change of Control Trigger Date"), each Holder
will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or
any part of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the Offer (but, with
respect to any partial tender of Notes, the Company shall only be
required to purchase principal amounts in integral multiples of
$1,000) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the

49
<PAGE>

aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase. The Offer shall be effected in
accordance with Section 3.8 and Article 3 (to the extent
applicable) and the provisions of this Section 4.12.

(b) Prior to the time required for the mailing of
notice with respect to an Offer pursuant to Section 3.8, the
Company will in good faith (i) seek to obtain any required
consent of the holders of any Senior Indebtedness the terms of
which prohibit the Company from repurchasing Notes so as to
permit the making of the Offer and the purchase of Notes pursuant
to this Section 4.12, (ii) use its best efforts to repay all or a
portion of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to the extent
necessary (including, if necessary, payment in full of such
Indebtedness and payment of any prepayment premiums, fees,
expenses or penalties) to permit the making of the Offer and the
purchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.12 without such
consent or (iii) if such Indebtedness is not then prepayable to
such extent, make an offer to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness from which consent is required and cannot be
obtained to repay such Indebtedness in full for an amount equal
to the outstanding principal balance thereof and accrued interest
to the date of repayment, plus any fees, expenses and penalties
required pursuant to the instruments governing such Indebtedness,
plus, in the event such Indebtedness is subsequently prepayable
at a premium, the premium payable when such Indebtedness is first
prepayable, and repay any holder who accepts such offer. 
Following compliance by the Company with the requirements of the
foregoing sentence, the Company shall, within the time required
for the mailing of notice with respect to an Offer pursuant to
Section 3.8, mail notice of such Offer.

Section 4.13 Redemption from the Proceeds of Asset Sales.

(a) The Company will not, and will not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Sale, whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, unless: (i) the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary receives consideration at
the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market
value of the Property or securities sold or otherwise disposed of
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company evidenced by a Board Resolution); (ii) at least 75% of
such consideration is in the form of cash; provided, however,
that the following shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of
this Section 4.13: (A) the amount of any liabilities (as shown
on the Company's or such Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet
or in the notes thereto) of the Company or such Subsidiary (other
than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the
Notes) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets, and
(B) any notes or other obligations received by the Company or any
such Subsidiary from a transferee that are converted by the
Company or such Subsidiary into cash within six months of such

50
<PAGE>

Asset Sale; provided further, that the 75% limitation referred to
in clause (ii) above shall not apply (AA) to any sale, transfer
or other disposition of assets constituting one or more
Broadcasting Stations in which the cash portion of such
consideration received therefor, determined in accordance with
the foregoing proviso, is equal to or greater than what the
after-tax net proceeds would have been had such transaction
complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation or (BB) to a so-
called "like-kind" exchange of assets, so long as (1) the assets
so received consist principally of cash or Cash Equivalents, the
assumption of liabilities and the acquisition of assets to be
used for or in connection with the business of owning and
operating Broadcasting Stations, and (2) at the time of and after
giving effect to such exchange, and treating any Indebtedness
Incurred as a result of such exchange as having been Incurred at
the time of such exchange, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing and the Company could Incur at
least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to Section
4.7(b); provided yet further that the 75% limitation referred to
in clause (ii) above shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
(AAA) at the date of the Asset Sale and after giving effect
thereto, Section 4.5(a) would permit the Company to make a
Restricted Payment in an amount equal to the difference between
the actual cash consideration received by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary with respect to such Asset Sale and 75% of
the fair market value of the Property or securities sold or
otherwise disposed of in such Asset Sale (determined as provided
above) and (BBB) the Company treats the receipt of non-cash
consideration in an amount equal to the amount set forth in the
foregoing clause (AAA) as a Restricted Payment under
Section 4.5(a), whether or not such receipt would otherwise be
classified as an Investment or a Permitted Investment; and (iii)
the Excess Cash Proceeds received by the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, from such Asset Sale are applied
in accordance with this Section 4.13. 

(b) Within 360 days after the later of such sale or
the receipt of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds from such
sale may (i) be applied to permanently reduce Senior
Indebtedness, (ii) be used to make Related Business Investments
or Capital Expenditures on one or more of the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' Broadcasting Stations or to enter into a contract
to acquire one or more Broadcasting Stations using such Excess
Proceeds and such acquisition is completed within such 360 day
period, or (iii) be used to make a payment permitted by Section
4.13(c), which payment shall be counted as a permanent reduction
of the amount of Designated Senior Debt available to be Incurred
pursuant to Section 4.7(c)(i) subject to the definitions of
"Senior Bank Debt" and "WGHP Debt." Any Excess Proceeds from an
Asset Sale not applied or invested as provided in clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this Section 4.13(b) will be deemed to

51
<PAGE>

constitute "Available Proceeds" and shall be applied as provided
in Section 4.13(d).

(c) The Company may use a portion of the Excess
Proceeds from an Asset Sale to pay dividends on the Company's
Capital Stock or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of the
Company's Capital Stock or warrants, rights or options to
purchase or acquire shares of the Company's Capital Stock (any
such dividend, redemption, repurchase or retirement out of Excess
Proceeds from a single Asset Sale an "Asset Sale Payment"),
subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this
Section 4.13(c). An Asset Sale Payment may be made by the
Company only if, and to the extent that, each of the following
conditions is satisfied as of the time of the proposed Asset Sale
Payment (the "Determination Time"): (i) the Company shall have
obtained a Bank Agent Consent; (ii) such Asset Sale Payment (as
well as all prior Asset Sale Payments, if any) shall be counted
as a permanent reduction of the amount of Designated Senior Debt
available to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.7(c)(i) subject to
the definitions of "Senior Bank Debt" and "WGHP Debt."; (ii) the
Determination Time occurs on or prior to December 31, 1996;
(iii) only two Asset Sale Payments will be permitted under this
Indenture; (iv) no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing at the Determination Time or as a
consequence of such Asset Sale Payment; and (v) after giving
effect to (A) the application of any Excess Proceeds from the
applicable Asset Sale in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) of
Section 4.13(b) prior to the Determination Time, (B) any Asset
Sale Redemption of Notes pursuant to Section 3.7(c) out of any
Excess Proceeds from the applicable Asset Sale and (C) any Asset
Sale Payment out of any Excess Proceeds from the applicable Asset
Sale, the ratio set forth below is equal to (but not more or less
than) 4.5:1.

where:

D = the aggregate amount of all outstanding Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis as of the Determination Time, without giving
effect to the Asset Sale Redemption (if any)
represented by "X" in the formula.

X = the principal amount of Notes (if any) to be redeemed
in an Asset Sale Redemption pursuant to Section 3.7(c)
out of Excess Proceeds from the applicable Asset Sale

in order to satisfy the conditions set forth in this
Section 4.13(c).

OCF = the Operating Cash Flow of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the four most
recent full fiscal quarters ending immediately prior to
the Determination Time, determined on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to (i) the applicable Asset Sale

quarter period as if they had occurred at the beginning
of such four-quarter period and (ii) all acquisitions
or other dispositions (whether by merger,
consolidation, purchase or sale of securities or assets
or otherwise) of any business or assets, made by the
Company and its Subsidiaries from the beginning of such
four-quarter period through the Determination Time as
if such acquisition or disposition had occurred at the
beginning of such four-quarter period.

made at the Determination Time pursuant to this
Section 4.13(c).

(d) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than
10 Business Days after any date (an "Asset Sale Trigger Date")
that the aggregate amount of Available Proceeds exceeds
$15,000,000, the Company shall, if and to the extent permitted by
the agreements governing any Senior Indebtedness of the Company,
subject to the provisions of Article 10, commence an offer to
purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be
purchased out of such Available Proceeds, at an offer price in
cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The Offer shall be
effected in accordance with Section 3.8 and Article 3 (to the
extent applicable) and the provisions of this Section 4.13. To
the extent that any Available Proceeds remain after completion of
an Offer, the Company may use the remaining amount for any
purpose permitted by this Indenture, but not, unless otherwise
permitted by Section 4.5, to offer to repurchase or otherwise
redeem, repurchase, retire or acquire for value any Pari Passu
Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness. In the event that the
Company is prohibited under the terms of any agreement governing
outstanding Senior Indebtedness of the Company from repurchasing
Notes with Available Proceeds pursuant to an Offer as required by

53
<PAGE>

the first sentence of this Section 4.13(d), the Company shall
promptly use all Available Proceeds to permanently reduce
outstanding Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

(e) If, at any time, any funds are received by or for the
account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries upon the sale,
conversion, collection or other liquidation of any non-cash
consideration received in respect of an Asset Sale, such funds
shall, when received, constitute Excess Proceeds and shall,
within 360 days after the receipt of such funds, be applied as
provided in this Section 4.13.

Section 4.14 Maintenance of Office or Agencies.

The Company will maintain in the City of New York, an office
or an agency (which may be an office of any Agent) where Notes
may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and
where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of
the Notes and this Indenture may be served. The Company will
give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any change in the
location of such office or agency. If at any time the Company
shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or
served at the Corporate Trust Office.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more
other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to
time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such
designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company
of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the City of
New York, for such purposes. The Company will give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or
rescission and of any change in the location of any such other
office or agency.

Section 4.15 Limitation on Certain Debt.

The Company shall not Incur or suffer to exist any
Indebtedness (other than Designated Senior Debt, purchase money
Indebtedness secured by a Lien described in clause (vi) of the
definition of Permitted Liens (so long as such Indebtedness was
not Incurred in violation of this Indenture), and the Notes) that
would rank subordinate to or junior in right of payment to any
other Indebtedness of the Company, unless the Indebtedness so
Incurred is either (i) Pari Passu Indebtedness or
(ii) Subordinated Indebtedness and by its terms, or by the terms
of any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such
Subordinated Indebtedness is Incurred, (A) such Subordinated
Indebtedness does not provide for payments of principal of such
Indebtedness at the stated maturity thereof or by way of a
sinking fund applicable thereto or by way of any mandatory

54
<PAGE>

redemption, defeasance, retirement or repurchase thereof by the
Company (including any redemption, retirement or repurchase which
is contingent upon events or circumstances, but excluding any
retirement required by virtue of acceleration of such
Indebtedness upon an event of default thereunder), in each case
prior to the final stated maturity of the Notes and (B) such
Subordinated Indebtedness does not permit redemption or other
retirement thereof (including pursuant to an offer to purchase
made by the Company) at the option of the holder thereof prior to
the final stated maturity of the Notes, other than a redemption
or other retirement at the option of the holder of such
Subordinated Indebtedness (including pursuant to an offer to
purchase made by the Company) which is conditioned upon a change
of control of the Company pursuant to provisions substantially
similar to those contained in Section 4.12; provided, however,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to (1) distinctions
between categories of Indebtedness which exist by reason of any
Liens arising or created in respect of some but not all
Indebtedness and (2) any intercreditor agreements (to which the
Company is not a party) among different classes of creditors of
the Company.

Section 4.16. Maintenance of Properties.

The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the
conduct of its business or the business of any Significant
Subsidiary of the Company to be maintained and kept in good
condition, repair and working order and supplied with all
necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary
repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements
thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary
so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be
properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 4.16 shall prevent the
Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of
such properties if such discontinuance is, as determined by the
Company in good faith, desirable in the conduct of its business
or the business of any Significant Subsidiary and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 4.17. Maintenance of Insurance.

The Company shall, and shall cause its Significant
Subsidiaries to, keep at all times all of their properties which
are of an insurable nature insured against loss or damage with
insurers believed by the Company to be responsible to the extent
that property of similar character is usually so insured by
corporations similarly situated and owning like properties in
accordance with good business practice. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Significant Subsidiaries to, use the proceeds
from any such insurance policy to repair, replace or otherwise
restore the property to which such proceeds relate, except to the

55
<PAGE>

extent that a different use of such proceeds is, as determined by
the Company, in good faith, desirable in the conduct of its
business or the business of any Subsidiary and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 4.18. Compliance with Laws.

The Company shall comply, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to comply, with all applicable statutes, rules,
regulations, orders and restrictions of the United States of
America, all states and municipalities thereof, and of any
governmental department, commission, board, regulatory authority,
bureau, agency and instrumentality of the foregoing, in respect
of the conduct of their respective businesses and the ownership
of their respective properties, except such as are being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and except
for such noncompliance as would not in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.19. Limitation on Issuances and Dispositions of
Capital Stock of Subsidiaries.

The Company (i) shall not, and shall not permit any
Subsidiary to, transfer, convey, sell, or otherwise dispose of
any Capital Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable
into, or options, warrants, rights or any other interest with
respect to, Capital Stock of a Subsidiary to any Person (other
than the Company or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) unless such
transfer, conveyance, sale, lease or other disposition is of 100%
of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary and the Excess Proceeds
from such transfer, conveyance or sale are applied in accordance
with Section 4.13 hereof and (ii) shall not permit any Subsidiary
to issue shares of its Capital Stock (other than directors'
qualifying shares), or securities convertible or exchangeable
into, or options, warrants, rights or any other interest with
respect to, its Capital Stock to any Person other than to the
Company or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary; provided, however, that
this Section 4.19 shall not prevent the sale of less than 100% of
the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary of the Company if
(A) immediately after and giving pro forma effect to such
transaction as if the Company ceased to own any equity interest
in such Subsidiary on the first day of the four most recent full
fiscal quarters ending immediately prior to such transaction
(even if less than 100% of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary
is sold) and the application of proceeds therefrom, the Company
could incur at least $1 of Indebtedness pursuant to Section
4.7(b) or (B) such Subsidiary accounted for 5% or less of
Operating Cash Flow for the four-quarter period described in
clause (A) and is projected by the Company in good faith (as set
forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee) to
account for less than 5% of Operating Cash Flow for the four
quarters immediately following such transaction.

Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness now
exists, or is created after the Issue Date if (A) such default
results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its
express maturity or shall constitute a default in the payment of
such Indebtedness at final maturity of such Indebtedness, and (B)
the principal amount of any such Indebtedness that has been
accelerated or not paid at maturity, when added to the aggregate
principal amount of all other such Indebtedness that has been
accelerated or not paid at maturity, exceeds $10,000,000; (v)
failure by the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries to
pay final judgments, the uninsured portion of which exceeds
$10,000,000, which judgments are not paid, discharged, bonded or

(vi) if under any Bankruptcy Law, (A) the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary commences a voluntary case, consents to
the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary
case, consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all
or substantially all of its property, or makes a general
assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or (B) a court of

involuntary case, appoints a Custodian of the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the
Property of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, or orders

the Trustee or by Holders of Notes with a copy to the Trustee
must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state
that the notice is a "Notice of Default."

60
<PAGE>

Section 6.2 Acceleration.

(a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default under Section 6.1(a)(vi)) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may declare all outstanding Notes to be
due and payable immediately and, upon such declaration, the
principal amount and premium, if any, of all such Notes, and any
accrued interest on, all such Notes to the date of payment shall
be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that if any
Indebtedness is outstanding pursuant to the Subsidiary Debt
Documents upon a declaration of acceleration of the Notes (other
than any such declaration as a result of an Event of Default
under Section 6.1(a)(iv)), the principal and interest on the
Notes will not be payable until the earlier of (1) the day which
is ten (10) Business Days after notice of acceleration is given
to the Company and the Senior Agent under the Bank Credit
Agreements, and (2) the date of acceleration of Indebtedness by
the Senior Agent.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Indenture, if an Event of Default arises under Section 6.1(a)(vi)
the principal amount of, and premium, if any, and any accrued and
unpaid interest on, all outstanding Notes shall ipso facto become
and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

(c) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may
rescind any declaration of acceleration of such Notes and its
consequences if (i) the rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree, (ii) if all existing Defaults and Events of
Default (other than the nonpayment of principal of, or premium,
if any, or interest on, the Notes which shall have become due by
such declaration) shall have been cured or waived, and (iii) the
Company has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the effect of
clauses (i) and (ii) above.

(d) In the event of a declaration of acceleration
under this Indenture because an Event of Default set forth in
Section 6.1(a)(iv) has occurred and is continuing, such
declaration of acceleration shall be automatically rescinded and
annulled if either (i) the holders of the Indebtedness which is
the subject of such Event of Default have waived such failure to
pay at maturity or have rescinded the acceleration in respect of
such Indebtedness within 10 days of such maturity or declaration
of acceleration, as the case may be, and no other Event of
Default has occurred during such 10-day period which has not been
cured or waived, or (ii) such Indebtedness shall have been
discharged or the maturity thereof shall have been extended such
that it is not then due and payable, or the underlying default

61
<PAGE>

has been cured within 10 days of such maturity or declaration of
acceleration as the case may be.

Section 6.3 Other Remedies.

Subject to the provisions of Article 10, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any
available remedy to collect the payment of principal or interest
on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of
the Notes or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not
possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the
proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in
exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default
shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or
acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are
cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.4 Waiver of Past Defaults.

Subject to the provisions of Sections 6.7 and 9.2 hereof,
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of
all Holders waive any existing Default or Event of Default and
its consequences under the Indenture, except a continuing Default
or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, any Note (which may only be
waived with the consent of each Holder affected). Upon any such
waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for
every purpose of this Indenture; provided that no such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

Section 6.5 Control by a Majority.

Subject to Section 7.1(e), the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes may direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. 
However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with applicable law or this Indenture, is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of other Holders, or would involve the
Trustee in personal liability; provided that the Trustee may take
other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not
inconsistent with such direction.

Section 6.6 Limitation on Suits.

A Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to this
Indenture or the Notes only if:

62
<PAGE>

(a) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of
a continuing Event of Default;

(b) the Holder or Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the Notes make a written request to the
Trustee to pursue the remedy; 

(c) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense to be incurred in
compliance with such request;

(d) the Trustee does not comply with the request
within 60 days after receipt of the request and
the offer of indemnity; and

(e) during such 60-day period the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes do not
give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the
request.

A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights
of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over any
other Holder. Holders of the Notes may not enforce this
Indenture, except as provided herein.

Section 6.7 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture but
subject to Article 10, the right of any Holder of a Note to
receive payment of principal and interest on the Note, on or
after the respective dates expressed in the Note, or to bring
suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such
respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the
consent of the Holder.

Section 6.8 Collection Suit by Trustee.

If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(a)(i) or
(a)(ii) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to
recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust against the Company for (i) the principal, premium, if any,
and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes, (ii) interest on
overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful,
interest in each case at the rate per annum expressly stated on
the Note, and (iii) such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Trustee, its agents and counsel ("Trustee Expenses").

63
<PAGE>

Section 6.9 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers
or documents as may be necessary or advisable to have the claims
of the Trustee (including any claim for Trustee Expenses and for
amounts due under Section 7.7) and the Holders allowed in any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other judicial proceeding
relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes),
its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered
to collect, receive and distribute to Holders any money or other
property payable or deliverable on any such claims and each
Holder authorizes any Custodian in any such Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding or other judicial proceeding to make such
payments to the Trustee, and if the Trustee shall consent to the
making of such payments directly to the Holders, any such
Custodian is hereby authorized to make such payments directly to
the Holders, and to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it
hereunder for Trustee Expenses, and any other amounts due the
Trustee under Section 7.7; provided, however, that the Trustee
shall not be authorized to (i) consent to, accept or adopt on
behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of
any Holder, or (ii) vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in
any such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. To the extent
that the payment of any such Trustee Expenses, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7 out of the estate in
any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of
the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of,
any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other
properties which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such
proceeding, whether in liquidation or under any plan of
reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.

Section 6.10 Priorities.

If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article,
it shall pay out the money in the following order:

First:
to the Holders of Senior Indebtedness to the extent
required or permitted by Article 10;

Second:
to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.7;

Third:
if, in accordance with Section 6.6, the Holders proceed
against the Company directly, without the Trustee, to the
Holders for their collection costs;

Fourth:
to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes

64
<PAGE>

for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or
priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and
payable on the Notes for principal and interest,
respectively; and

Fifth:to the Company.

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any
payment to Holders.

Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action
taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may
require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its
discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having
due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses
made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a
suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.7,
or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the
Notes.

ARTICLE 7

TRUSTEE

Section 7.1 Duties of Trustee.

(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same
degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

(1) The Trustee need perform only those duties that
are specifically set forth in this Indenture and
no others.

(2) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the
Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of
the statements and the correctness of the opinions
expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions
furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the
requirements of this Indenture. However, the
Trustee shall examine the certificates and

65
<PAGE>

opinions to determine whether they conform to this
Indenture.

(c) The Trustee shall not be relieved from liability for
its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to
act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of
paragraph (b) of this Section;

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of
judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer,
unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent
in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to
any action it takes or omits to take in good faith
in accordance with a direction received by it
pursuant to Section 6.5.

(d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way
relates to the Trustee shall be subject to paragraphs
(a), (b) and (c) of this Section.

(e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any
liability. The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty
or exercise any right or power unless it receives
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense.

(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any
money received by it except as otherwise agreed in
writing with the Company. Money held in trust by the
Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except
to the extent required by law.

Section 7.2 Rights of Trustee.

(a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any
fact or matter stated in the document.

(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may
consult with counsel and may require an Officers'
Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee
shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to
take in good faith in reliance on the Certificate or
Opinion, provided that such action or omission does not
constitute gross negligence.

66
<PAGE>

(c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be
responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any
agent appointed with due care.

(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes
or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be
authorized or within its rights or powers.

Section 7.3 Individual Rights of Trustee. 

(1) The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may
become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal
with the Company with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee. Any Agent or an Affiliate may do the same
with like rights. However, the Trustee is subject to
Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

Section 7.4 Trustee's Disclaimer.

The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or
adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be
accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes,
and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Notes
other than its authentication.

Section 7.5 Notice of Defaults.

If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is actually
known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder
notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in
the case of a Default in payment of the principal of or interest
on any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long
as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines
that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Holders. 
The Trustee will not be deemed to have actual knowledge of an
event or circumstance for purposes of this Indenture unless (i)
it shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or
a Holder, (ii) it shall have been acting as Paying Agent when a
default under 6.1(a)(i) or 6.1(a)(ii) hereof shall have occurred
or (iii) a Trust Officer shall have actual knowledge thereof.

Section 7.6 Reports by Trustee to Holders.

After the Company qualifies the Indenture under the TIA, the
Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated within 60
days as of the reporting date that complies with TIA Section
313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section
313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports
required by TIA Section 313(c).

Commencing at the time this Indenture is qualified under the
TIA, a copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders

67
<PAGE>

shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the
Notes are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee when the
Notes are listed on any stock exchange.

Section 7.7 Compensation and Indemnity.

The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services. The Trustee's
compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a
trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the
Trustee upon request for all reasonable disbursements, expenses
and advances incurred or made by it. Such expenses shall include
the reasonable compensation and disbursements and expenses of the
Trustee's agents and counsel.

The Company shall indemnify the Trustee against, and hold
the Trustee harmless against, any loss or liability incurred by
it. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim
for which it may seek indemnity. The Trustee may have separate
counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any
settlement made without its consent.

The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify
against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through
negligence or bad faith.

To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section,
the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or
Property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in
trust to pay principal and interest on particular Notes.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after
an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(a)(vi) occurs, the
expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to
constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

Section 7.8 Replacement of Trustee.

A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor
Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section.

The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company. The
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may remove
the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company. The
Company may remove the Trustee if:

(a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;

(b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;

68
<PAGE>

(c) a receiver or public officer takes charge of the
Trustee or its Property; or

(d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists
in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall
promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the
successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to
replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days
after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring
Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in principal
amount of the Notes may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal
of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of
its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company.
Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee
shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all
the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this
Indenture. The successor Trustee or the Company, with the
consent of the successor Trustee, shall mail a notice of its
succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly
transfer all Property held by it as Trustee to the successor
Trustee, subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.7. 
Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this
Section 7.8, the Company's obligations under Section 7.7 shall
continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

Section 7.9 Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.

If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts with or
into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate
trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation
without any further act shall, if such resulting, surviving or
transferee corporation is otherwise eligible hereunder, be the
successor Trustee.

Section 7.10 Eligibility; Disqualifications.

At all times this Indenture shall have a Trustee which
satisfies the requirements of TIA Section 310(a)(l) and (5), and
the Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least
Fifty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000,000.00) as stated in
Section 11.10. After such qualification, the Trustee shall

69
<PAGE>

comply with TIA Section 310(b), including the optional provision
permitted by the second sentence of TIA Section 310(b)(9).

Section 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

After the Company qualifies this Indenture under the TIA,
the Trustee shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a), excluding any
creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). After such
qualification, a Trustee which has resigned or been removed shall
be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated.

ARTICLE 8

DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE

Section 8.1 Discharge of Liability on Notes; Defeasance.

(a) Subject to Sections 8.1(c) and 8.6, this Indenture
shall cease to be of any further effect after (i) either the
Company has delivered to the Trustee all outstanding Notes (other
than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.7) for cancellation or
all outstanding Notes have become due and payable and the Company
has irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or a Paying Agent
money and/or direct, non-callable obligations of, or non-callable
obligations guaranteed by, the United States of America for the
payment of which obligation or guarantee the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged ("U.S.
Government Obligations") maturing as to principal and interest in
an amount sufficient (without reinvestment thereof and after
payment of all Federal, state and local taxes or other charges in
respect thereof payable by the Trustee) to pay when due all
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, all outstanding
Notes (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.7), and
(ii) the Company pays all other sums payable under this
Indenture.

(b) Subject to Sections 8.1(c), 8.2, and 8.6, the
Company at any time may terminate (i) all its obligations under

its obligations under Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9,
4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.15 ("Covenant Defeasance
Option"). The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance Option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its Covenant Defeasance
Option.

If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance Option,
payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event
of Default. If the Company exercises its Covenant Defeasance
Option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in 6.1(a)(iii), (iv) or (v).

70
<PAGE>

Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2
and upon the Company's request (and at the Company's expense),
the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those
obligations that the Company has terminated.

(c) Notwithstanding Sections 8.1(a) and (b), the
Company's obligations under Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7,
4.1, 4.4, 7.7, 7.8, 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6, and the obligations of the
Trustee and the Paying Agent under Section 8.4 shall survive
until the Notes have been paid in full. Thereafter the Company's
obligations under Section 7.7 and 8.5 and the obligations of the
Company, Trustee and Paying Agent under Section 8.4 shall
survive.

Section 8.2 Conditions to Defeasance.

The Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance Option or its
Covenant Defeasance Option only if: (i) the Company irrevocably
deposits in trust with the Trustee or a Paying Agent money and/or
U.S. Government Obligations in an amount that, in the opinion of
a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, is
sufficient (without reinvestment thereof) for payment in full of
all principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes
when due; provided, however, that the Company may only make such
deposit if Article 10 does not prohibit payments on the Notes at
the time of the deposit; (ii) 91 days have passed since the
Company's irrevocable deposit pursuant to Section 8.2; (iii) no
Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such
deposit and after giving effect to it; (iv) such deposit does not
constitute a default under any other agreement binding on the
Company; (v) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit
does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
(vi) in the case of a Legal Defeasance Option, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that
(1) the Company has received from, or there has been published
by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (2) under
applicable federal income tax law, in either case, to the effect
that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm
that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and
will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such defeasance had not occurred; (vii) in the case of a Covenant
Defeasance Option, the Company shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will
not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be
subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
covenant defeasance had not occurred; and (viii) the Company

71
<PAGE>

delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the
defeasance and discharge of the Notes contemplated by this
Article 8 have been satisfied.

Section 8.3 Application of Trust Money.

The Trustee or Paying Agent shall hold in trust money and/or
U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this
Article 8. The Trustee or Paying Agent shall apply the deposited
money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations in
accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of,
and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes. Money deposited
with the Trustee or a Paying Agent pursuant to this Article 8
shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 10.

Section 8.4 Repayment of Company.

After the Notes have been paid in full, the Trustee and the
Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company any excess
money or securities held by them.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or a Paying Agent
pursuant to this Article 8 for the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on, any Note that remains unclaimed
for two years after becoming due and payable shall be paid to the
Company on its request; and the Holder of such Note shall
thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the
Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or
such Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease;
provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before
being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense
of the Company cause to be published once, in The New York Times
and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such
money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein,
which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such
notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money
then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

Section 8.5 Indemnity for U.S. Government Obligations.

The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee and
any Paying Agent against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on
or assessed against cash and/or U.S. Government Obligations
deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8 or the principal and
interest received on such cash and/or U.S. Government
Obligations.

Section 8.6 Reinstatement.

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money
or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8

72
<PAGE>

by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or
judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the
Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be
revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant
to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent
is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government
Obligations in accordance with this Article 8; provided, however,
that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, any Notes because of the
reinstatement of its obligations under this Indenture and the
Notes, the Company shall be subrogated to the Holders' rights to
receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government
Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

ARTICLE 9

AMENDMENTS

Section 9.1 Amendments and Supplements Permitted Without
Consent of Holders.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 9.2, the Company and the
Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes
without the consent of any Holder to: (i) cure any ambiguity,
defect or inconsistency; provided that such amendment does not
adversely affect the rights of any Holder; (ii) provide for
uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated
Notes; (iii) provide for the assumption of the Company's
obligations to the Holders in the event of any Disposition
involving the Company that is permitted under Article 5 in which
the Company is not the Surviving Person; (iv) make any change
that would (1) provide any additional rights or benefits to
Holders or (2) not adversely affect the legal rights under the
Indenture of any Holder, (v) comply with the requirements of the
Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of
this Indenture under the TIA, or (vi) provide for the issuance of
the Series B Notes, which will have terms substantially identical
in all material respects to the Series A Notes (except that the
transfer restrictions contained in the Series A Notes will be
modified or eliminated as appropriate), and which will be
treated, together with any outstanding Series A Notes, as a
single issue of Notes.

(b) Upon the Company's request, after receipt by the
Trustee of a resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing the
execution of any amended or supplemental indenture, and the
documents described in Section 9.6, the Trustee shall join with
the Company in the execution of any amended or supplemental
indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture
and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations

73
<PAGE>

that may be contained in any such amended or supplemental
indenture, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into
an amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights,
duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

Section 9.2 Amendments and Supplements Requiring Consent of
Holders.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.1(a) and
9.2(c), the Indenture and the Notes may be amended or
supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer for the Notes), and any existing Default
or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of Holders
of at least a majority in principal of the then outstanding Notes
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer for the Notes).

(b) Upon the Company's request and after receipt by
the Trustee of a resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing
the execution of any supplemental indenture, evidence of the
Holders' consent, and the documents described in Section 9.6, the
Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such
amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or
supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties
or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case
the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.

(c) Without the consent of each Holder affected, no
amendment, supplement or waiver to this Indenture shall: (i)
reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent
to an amendment, supplement or waiver, (ii) reduce the principal
of or change the fixed maturity of any Note, or alter the
provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes in a
manner adverse to the Holders, (iii) reduce the rate of or change
the time for payment of interest on any Note, (iv) waive a
Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes (except that Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may (1) rescind an acceleration of the Notes
that resulted from a non-payment default, and (2) waive the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration), (v) make
any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes,
(vi) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating
to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders to receive
payments of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the
Notes, (vii) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note,
(viii) make any change to the provisions of Article 10 that

74
<PAGE>

adversely affects Holders, or (ix) make any change in Section
6.4, Section 6.7 or this sentence.

(d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the
Holders under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if
such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment,
supplement or waiver under this Section 9.2 becomes effective,
the Company shall mail to each Holder affected thereby a notice
briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any
failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect
therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the
validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.

Section 9.3 Compliance with TIA.

Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes
shall be set forth in an amended supplemental indenture that
complies with the TIA as then in effect.

Section 9.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents.

(a) Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes
effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing
consent by the Holder and every subsequent holder of a Note or
portion of a Note that evidences the same Indebtedness as the
consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not
made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder
may revoke the consent as to his or her Note or portion of a Note
if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date
on which the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying
that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have
consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the
amendment or waiver.

(b) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to,
fix a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of
Notes entitled to consent to any amendment or waiver. If a
record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the
immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were holders
of Notes at such record date (or their duly designated proxies),
and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such
amendment or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given,
whether or not such Persons continue to be holders of Notes after
such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for
more than 90 days after such record date.

(c) After an amendment or waiver becomes effective it
shall bind every Holder, unless it is of the type described in
Section 9.2(c), in which case the amendment or waiver shall only
bind each Holder that consented to it and every subsequent holder

75
<PAGE>

of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's
Note.

Section 9.5 Notation on or Exchange of Notes.

The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an
amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter
authenticated. The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue
and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes that reflect the
amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate
notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and
effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

Section 9.6 Trustee Protected.

The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplemental
indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment
does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need
not, sign it. In signing such amendment or supplemental
indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject
to Section 7.1, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an
Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel pursuant to Sections
11.4 and 11.5 as conclusive evidence that such amendment or
supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this
Indenture, that it is not inconsistent herewith, and that it will
be valid and binding upon the Company in accordance with its
terms. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental
indenture until the Board of Directors approves it.

Section 9.7 Amendments Requiring Consent of Holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

No amendment or modification to Article 10, this Section 9.7
or Section 11.15 may be made to this Indenture without the
consent of (a) so long as any Obligations with respect to any
Indebtedness under any Bank Credit Agreements remain unpaid,
holders of at least 66 % of the outstanding Indebtedness under
the Bank Credit Agreements (and, to the extent that there are
unused commitments under the Bank Credit Agreements, such unused
commitments), and (b) after all Indebtedness under the Bank
Credit Agreements has been paid in full, and all commitments of
each of the Bank Lenders thereunder have been terminated in full,
holders of at least 66 % of the outstanding Indebtedness under
the WGHP Notes (and to the extent there are outstanding
commitments under the WGHP Notes, such unused commitments).

ARTICLE 10

SUBORDINATION

Section 10.1 Agreement to Subordinate.

The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note
agrees, any provision of this Indenture or the Notes to the
contrary notwithstanding, that all Subordinated Obligations owed
under and in respect of the Notes or any of the other Applicable
Documents are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and
in the manner provided in this Article 10, to the prior payment
in full in cash of all Obligations owed under and in respect of
all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and that the
subordination of the Subordinated Obligations pursuant to this
Article 10 is for the benefit of all holders of all Senior
Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding on the Issue
Date or Incurred thereafter.

Section 10.2 Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy.

(a) Upon any distribution of cash, securities or other
property of the Company to creditors upon any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company, the holders
of any Senior Indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in
full in cash or Cash Equivalents of all Obligations under or in
respect of such Senior Indebtedness (including Post-Petition
Interest) before the Holders will be entitled to receive any
payment or distribution (other than in Reorganization Securities)
on account of Subordinated Obligations and until all Obligations
with respect to such Senior Indebtedness are paid in full in cash
or Cash Equivalents, any payment or distribution (other than in
Reorganization Securities) on account of Subordinated Obligations
to which the Holders would be entitled shall be made to the
holders of the Company's Senior Indebtedness on a pro rata basis. 
Upon any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the
Company, any payment or distribution (other than in
Reorganization Securities), to which the Holders or the Trustee
would be entitled on account of Subordinated Obligations but for
the provisions of this Article 10 shall be paid by the Company,
any Custodian or other Person making such payment or
distribution, or by the Holders or by the Trustee or the Paying
Agent if received by them, directly to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the
amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by them) or their
Representatives, as their interests may appear, for application
to the payment of all outstanding Senior Indebtedness until all
such Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash, after
giving effect to all other payments or distributions to, or
provisions made for, holders of Senior Indebtedness.

(b) The consolidation of the Company with, or the
merger of the Company into, another Person or the liquidation or
dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer
of all or substantially all of its Property and assets as an
entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set
forth in Article 5 shall not be deemed an Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding for the purposes of this Section 10.2 if
the Surviving Person shall, as a part of such consolidation,
merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions set
forth in Article 5.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Indenture, any Disposition by or involving the Company, or the
liquidation or dissolution of the Company following any
Disposition, shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section
10.2 if such Disposition is permitted under Article 5.

Section 10.3 Default on Senior Indebtedness.

Neither the Company nor any Trustee or Paying Agent shall
make any payment or distribution (other than in Reorganization
Securities) on account of Subordinated Obligations if (a) a
default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any,
or interest on, or any other amount owing with respect to any
Senior Indebtedness (a "Payment Default") occurs and is
continuing, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment
or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise, or (b) the
Trustee has received written notice (a "Payment Blockage Notice")
from the Senior Agent that a Nonpayment Default (as defined
below) has occurred and is continuing; provided, however, that
payments and distributions on account of Subordinated Obligations
shall resume, and all past due amounts on the Notes shall be paid
(i) in the case of a Payment Default, on the date on which such
default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist and all
Obligations then due and payable in respect of Senior
Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash or Cash
Equivalents and (ii) in the case of a Nonpayment Default, on the
earliest of (A) the date on which such Nonpayment Default is
cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, (B) 179 days after
the date on which the Payment Blockage Notice with respect to
such Nonpayment Default was received by the Trustee, or (C) the
date on which such blockage period shall have been terminated by
written notice to the Company or the Trustee from the Senior
Agent unless the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness has been
accelerated and the Company has defaulted with respect to the
payment of such Senior Indebtedness. No more than one Payment
Blockage Notice may be given during any consecutive 365-day
period and during any consecutive 365-day period, the aggregate
number of days in which payments due on the Notes may not be made
as a result of Nonpayment Defaults on Senior Indebtedness shall
not exceed 179 days and there shall be a period of at least 186

78
<PAGE>

consecutive days in each consecutive 365-day period when such
payments are not prohibited. If the Senior Agent delivers a
Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee in respect of any
Nonpayment Default, no Nonpayment Default that existed or was
continuing on the date of delivery of such notice shall be, or be
made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice unless
such default shall have been waived or cured for a period of not
less than 90 days. "Nonpayment Default" means any event of
default under the terms of any instrument governing any Senior
Indebtedness permitting one or more holders of such Senior
Indebtedness (or a Representative on behalf of the holders
thereof) to declare all or part of such Senior Indebtedness due
and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise become
due and payable.

Section 10.4 Acceleration of Notes.

If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event
of Default, the Company shall promptly notify the Senior Agent
and each holder of the Company's Senior Indebtedness of the
acceleration.

Section 10.5 When Distributions Must be Paid Over.

(a) If the Company or any Trustee or Paying Agent
shall make any payment or distribution on account of Subordinated
Obligations at a time when such payment is prohibited by this
Article 10, then and in such event the Trustee, Paying Agent or
Holders, as the case may be, receiving such payment or
distribution shall hold such payment or distribution in trust for
the benefit of, and shall pay over and deliver to, the holders of
the Senior Indebtedness (pro rata as to each of such holders on
the basis of the respective amounts of such Senior Indebtedness
held by them) or their Representative, as their respective
interests may appear, for application to the payment of all
outstanding Senior Indebtedness until all such Senior
Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents,
after giving effect to all other payments or distributions to, or
provisions made for, the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

(b) Nothing contained in this Article 10 or elsewhere
in this Indenture or in the Notes shall prevent (i) the Company,
at any time except during the pendency of any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding or under the conditions described in
Section 10.3, from making payments or distributions on account of
Subordinated Obligations or (ii) the application by any Trustee
or Paying Agent of any money deposited with it hereunder to such
payments or distributions or the retention of such payments or
distributions by the Holders, if, at the time of such application
by such Trustee or Paying Agent, it did not have knowledge that
such payment or distribution would have been prohibited by the
provisions of this Article 10.

79
<PAGE>

(c) With respect to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such
obligations on its part as are specifically set forth in this
Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect
to any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this
Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed
to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness,
and shall not be liable to any holders of Senior Indebtedness if
the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to, or on behalf of,
Holders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to
which any holders of Senior Indebtedness are entitled pursuant to
this Article 10, except if such payment is made at a time when a
Trust Officer has knowledge that the terms of this Article 10
prohibit such payment.

Section 10.6 Notice.

(a) Neither the Trustee nor any Paying Agent shall at
any time be charged with the knowledge of the existence of any
facts that would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the
Trustee or Paying Agent under this Article 10, unless and until
the Trustee or Paying Agent shall have received written notice
thereof from the Company, the Senior Agent, one or more holders
of Senior Indebtedness or a Representative of any holders of
Senior Indebtedness; and, prior to the receipt of any such
written notice, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall be entitled to
assume conclusively that no such facts exist. The Trustee shall
be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of written notice by a
Person representing itself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness
(or a Representative thereof) to establish that such notice has
been given. In the event that the Trustee or Paying Agent
determines in good faith that further evidence is required with
respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior
Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution
pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee or Paying Agent may
request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Trustee or Paying Agent as to the amount of
Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such 
Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution
and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under
this Article 10, and if such evidence is not furnished, the
Trustee or Paying Agent may defer any payment to such Person
pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to
receive such payment.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and
the Paying Agent in writing of any facts it knows that would
cause a payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest
on, the Notes or any other Obligation in respect of the Notes to
violate this Article 10, but failure to give such notice shall
not affect the subordination of the Subordinated Obligations to

80
<PAGE>

the Senior Indebtedness provided in this Article 10 or the rights
of holders of such Senior Indebtedness under this Article 10.

Section 10.7 Subrogation.

After all Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash
or Cash Equivalents and until the Notes are paid in full, the
Holders shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other
Indebtedness pari passu with the Notes) to the rights of holders
of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable
to such Senior Indebtedness to the extent that distributions
otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment
of such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this
Article 10 to holders of Senior Indebtedness that otherwise would
have been made to the Holders is not, as among the Company, its
creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the
Holders, a payment or distribution by the Company to or on
account of its Senior Indebtedness.

Section 10.8 Relative Rights.

(a) The provisions of this Article 10 are and are
intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights
of the Holders on the one hand and the holders of Senior
Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing contained in this
Article 10 or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Notes is
intended to or shall (i) impair, as among the Company, its
creditors other then holders of Senior Indebtedness and the
Holders of the Notes, the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of, and premium, if
any, and interest on, the Notes in accordance with their terms;
(ii) affect the relative rights of the Holders and the Company's
creditors other than their rights in relation to holders of
Senior Indebtedness; or (iii) prevent the Trustee or any Holder
from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of
Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness
to receive payment and distributions otherwise payable or
distributable to the Holders.

(b) The failure to make a payment on account of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes by
reason of any provision of this Article 10 shall not be construed
as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section
6.1.

Section 10.9 The Company and Holders May Not Impair
Subordination.

(a) No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to
enforce the subordination as provided in this Article 10 shall at
any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or
failure to act by the Company or by any noncompliance by the

81
<PAGE>

Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this
Indenture, the Notes, any other Applicable Document or any other
agreement regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such
holder may have or be otherwise charged with.

(b) Without in any way limiting Section 10.9(a), the
holders of any Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time
to time, without the consent of or notice to any Holders, without
incurring any liabilities to any Holder and without impairing or
releasing the subordination and other benefits provided in this
Indenture or the Holders' obligations to the holders of such
Senior Indebtedness, even if any Holder's right of reimbursement
or subrogation or other right or remedy is affected, impaired or
extinguished thereby, do any one or more of the following: (i)
amend, renew, exchange, extend, modify, increase or supplement in
any manner such Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing
or guaranteeing or securing such Senior Indebtedness or any
agreement under which such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding
(including, but not limited to, changing the manner, place or
terms of payment or changing or extending the time of payment of,
or renewing, exchanging, amending, increasing, releasing,
terminating or altering, (1) the terms of such Senior
Indebtedness, (2) any security for, or any guarantee of, such
Senior Indebtedness, (3) any liability of any obligor on such
Senior Indebtedness (including any guarantor) or any liability
Incurred in respect of such Senior Indebtedness); (ii) sell,
exchange, release, surrender, realize upon, enforce or otherwise
deal with in any manner and in any order any property pledged,
mortgaged or otherwise securing such Senior Indebtedness or any
liability of any obligor thereon, to such holder, or any
liability Incurred in respect thereof; (iii) settle or compromise
any such Senior Indebtedness or any other liability of any
obligor of such Senior Indebtedness to such holder or any
security therefor or any liability Incurred in respect thereof
and apply any sums by whomsoever paid and however realized to any
liability (including, without limitation, payment of any of
Senior Indebtedness) in any manner or order; and (iv) release,
terminate or otherwise cancel, or fail to take or to record or
otherwise perfect, for any reason or for no reason, any Lien or
security interest securing such Senior Indebtedness by whomsoever
granted, exercise or delay in or refrain from exercising any
right or remedy against any obligor or any guarantor or any other
Person, elect any remedy and otherwise deal freely with any
obligor and any security for such Senior Indebtedness or any
liability of any obligor to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness or any liability Incurred in respect of such Senior
Indebtedness.

Section 10.10 Distribution or Notice to Representative.

Whenever a distribution is to be made, or a notice given, to
holders of Senior Indebtedness, the distribution may be made and

82
<PAGE>

the notice given to their Representative, if any. If any payment
or distribution of the Company's assets is required to be made to
holders of any Senior Indebtedness pursuant to this Article 10,
the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any
order or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, or upon
any certificate of a Representative of such Senior Indebtedness
or a Custodian, in ascertaining the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness entitled to participate in any such payment or
distribution, the amount to be paid or distributed to holders of
such Senior Indebtedness and all other facts pertinent to such
payment or distribution or to this Article 10.

Section 10.11 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.

The Trustee or Paying Agent may continue to make payments on
the Notes unless prior to any payment date it has received
written notice of facts that would cause a payment or
distribution on account of Subordinated Obligations to violate
this Article 10. Only the Company, a Representative of Senior
Indebtedness, or a holder of Senior Indebtedness that has no
Representative may give such notice.

To the extent permitted by the TIA, the Trustee in its
individual or any other capacity may hold Indebtedness of the
Company (including Senior Indebtedness) with the same rights it
would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same
with like rights.

Section 10.12 Authorization to Effect Subordination.

Each Holder of a Note by its acceptance thereof authorizes
and directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may
be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as
provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee as such
Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes,
(including, without limitation, the timely filing of a claim for
the unpaid balance of the Note that such Holder holds in the form
required in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and causing
such claim to be approved).

If a proper claim or proof of debt in the form required in
such proceeding is not filed by or on behalf of all Holders prior
to 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claims
or proofs, then the holders or a Representative of any Senior

distribution on account of Subordinated Obligations" shall
include, without limitation, any direct or indirect payment or
distribution on account of the purchase, prepayment, redemption,
retirement, defeasance or acquisition of any Note or with respect
to any other Applicable Document, any recovery by the exercise of

principal, premium or interest with respect to or in connection
with any mandatory or optional redemption or purchase provisions,
any direct or indirect payment or distribution payable or

Section 10.14 Defeasance of this Article 10.

The subordination of the Notes provided by this Article 10
is expressly made subject to the provisions for defeasance in
Article 8 hereof and, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, upon the effectiveness of any such defeasance
(provided that any deposit pursuant to Section 8.2 was not
prohibited by this Section 10 or any other instrument or
agreement governing any Senior Indebtedness and did not
constitute a default under any such instrument or agreement), the
Notes then outstanding shall thereupon cease to be subordinated
pursuant to this Article 10; provided, however, that if the

have no claim, right or demand against any Subsidiary of the
Company or any assets or properties of any Subsidiary of the
Company on or in respect of the Notes or other Applicable
Documents; (b) the Company is, and is capitalized as, a separate
legal entity such that any claim, right or demand by the Holders
with respect to the assets and properties of any Subsidiary of
the Company would be solely as a creditor of a direct or indirect
shareholder of such Subsidiary and that such arrangement has been
relied upon by and is for the benefit of holders of Senior

84

Indebtedness; (c) the Company's direct and indirect Subsidiaries
have no obligation to pay dividends to or to make Investments in
the Company, for the purpose of funding payment obligations of
the Company to the Holders or otherwise, (d) the Subsidiary Debt
Documents permit Subsidiaries of the Company to pay dividends to
or to make Investments in the Company only in limited amounts and
under specified circumstances (provided that any and all such
limitations shall at all times be subject to Section 4.11
hereof); and (e) the Subsidiary Debt Documents restrict the
amendment of this Indenture, the Notes and the other Applicable
Documents without the consent of certain of the Bank Lenders.

1. Interest. Great American Communications Company (the
"Company") promises to pay interest on the principal amount of
this Note at the rate and in the manner specified below. 
Interest on this Note will accrue at 9 % per annum from the date
this Note is issued until maturity and will be payable
semiannually in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year,
or if any such day is not a Business Day on the next succeeding

Note will accrue from the most recent date on which interest has
been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from February 18,
1994, provided that the first Interest Payment Date shall be
August 15, 1994. The Company shall pay interest on overdue
principal and premium, if any, from time to time on demand at the
rate of 1.5% per annum in excess of the interest rate then in

(without regard to any applicable grace periods) from time to
time on demand at the same rate to the extent lawful. Interest
will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.

2. Method of Payment. The Company will pay interest on

United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for
payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may
pay principal, premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of
Federal funds, or interest by check payable in such money, and
any such check may be mailed to a Holder's registered address.

Subsidiaries may act in any such capacity.

4. Indenture. The Company issued the Notes under an
Indenture, dated as of February 18, 1994 (the "Indenture"), by

the original issuance of the Notes (the "Trust Indenture Act"). 
The Notes are subject to, and qualified by, all such terms,
certain of which are summarized herein, and Holders are referred
