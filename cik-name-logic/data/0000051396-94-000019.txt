MALLINCKRODT NAMES PRESIDENT FOR VETERINARY COMPANY;
FORMER MERCK EXECUTIVE BRINGS STRONG INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE

ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, October 3, 1994 -- Mallinckrodt Group Inc.
(NYSE:MKG) announced today that Paul D. Cottone, formerly vice
president of U.S. operations for the Merck AgVet Division, has
joined Mallinckrodt Veterinary as president and chief executive

senior vice president of Mallinckrodt Group.

"We are extremely pleased to have attracted an animal health
industry executive of this caliber," said C. Ray Holman,
Mallinckrodt Group president and chief executive officer. 
"Paul has extensive knowledge of the animal health industry,
strong U.S. and international experience in both the animal and
human health industries, and a solid business and management
portfolio with accountability for total operations for major
business segments. Mallinckrodt's firm commitment to our
animal health business is even stronger today with an
individual of Cottone's stature at the helm."

Cottone said, "I share the Mallinckrodt management team's
enthusiasm for the future of the animal health business, look
forward to building on the leadership position the company has
established over many years and am firmly committed to
achieving financial objectives that are expected to contribute
to the growth and success of the company."

Cottone's seven years of experience with Merck AgVet included
six years as executive director, international operations,
which included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,
and Japan. In 1993, he was promoted to the position of vice
president, U.S. operations with the division.

He joined Merck Sharp & Dohme in 1972 and for four years sold
human health products to doctors and hospitals. He
subsequently held several product management sales and
marketing positions until 1982, when he was named director of
marketing and sales - MSD Australia. Cottone later was
managing director - MSD New Zealand and director of
Pharmaceutical operations - MSD Brazil. In 1986, he was named
senior director, U.S. Regional Operations.

A native of Brooklyn, New York, Cottone has a B.S. degree in
pharmacy from Fordham University (New York) and did post-
graduate work in the MBA program at Fairleigh Dickinson
University (New Jersey). He is a member of the board of
directors of the Animal Health Institute.

Mallinckrodt Group, a St. Louis-based Fortune 250 company, has
