Item 4. Changes in Registrant's
-----------------------
Certifying Accountant
-----------------------

Effective March 14, 1994, Paramount Communications Inc. (the 

"Company") replaced Ernst & Young, its independent public accountants, with 

Price Waterhouse, the independent public accountants of Viacom Inc. ("Viacom"),

which acquired control of the Company on March 2, 1994.

The decision to replace Ernst & Young with Price Waterhouse was 

recommended by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and was 

approved by the Company's Board of Directors. 

The reports of Ernst & Young on the financial statements for the

past two fiscal years contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and

were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting 

principles.

In connection with its audits for the two most recent fiscal 

years and any subsequent interim period, there have been no disagreements with 

Ernst & Young on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial 

statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if 

not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young would have caused it to make 

reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its 

report.

The Company has provided Ernst & Young with a copy of the 

disclosure contained in this Item 4 and attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of 

Ernst & Young's letter responding to the statements made herein.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

Effective March 15, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors 

adopted a resolution providing that the Company's fiscal year shall be the 11 

month period ending March 31, 1994 and subsequently the Company's fiscal year 

shall be conformed to that of Viacom or any successor thereto. The report 

concerning the transition period will be filed on Form 10-K.
