TEXACO REPORTS RESULTS
FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR 1993

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 1994.
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Jan. 24 - Texaco Inc. announced
today that consolidated worldwide net income from continuing
operations (including special gains and charges) for the fourth
quarter of 1993 was $349 million, or $1.25 per share, as compared
with $341 million, or $1.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of
1992. Comparable net income (including special gains and
charges) for the year 1993 was $1,259 million, or $4.47 per
share, as compared with $1,038 million, or $3.63 per share, for
the year 1992. Net income from continuing operations is before
the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and
discontinued chemical operations.

</TABLE>

In commenting on 1993's performance Alfred C. DeCrane, Jr.,
Texaco's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
stated, "Results for the fourth quarter and year reflect strong
operational performance in the face of crude oil prices which
weakened significantly in the third and fourth quarters, and
which remain depressed. Redesigned business processes and
restructured operations contributed to a 4 percent reduction in
1993 operating and overhead expenses. The ability to cut cash
operating expenses for the third year running confirms the
importance of the quality process as a key ingredient of Texaco's
business strategy."

<PAGE>

Net income for the year 1993 included $210 million of net
tax benefits realizable through sales of interests in a
subsidiary, as well as $152 million of net deferred tax benefits
arising from tax law changes in the third quarter. These tax law
changes include the effect of changes in the U.K. Petroleum
Revenue Tax relating to the taxability of certain items and
a tax rate reduction from 75 percent to 50 percent, which were
partially offset by charges related to the increase in the U.S.
tax rate to 35 percent retroactive to January 1, 1993. Net
income for the fourth quarter of 1992 included tax benefits of
$30 million from the sale of a partial stock interest in a
subsidiary. 
Results for 1993 and 1992 also included special charges of
$235 and $130 million, respectively. These charges related to
staff reductions, writedowns of certain assets, and financial
reserves related to environmental remediation and the expected
resolution of oil and gas issues.

</TABLE>

The fourth quarter 1993 results benefitted from reduced
operating expenses; however, these benefits were more than offset
by lower crude oil prices of approximately $4 per barrel. 
Results for the year 1993 reflect higher natural gas prices and
lower expenses, and a $2 per barrel decline in crude oil and
condensate prices as well as slightly lower crude oil and natural
gas production. However, the successful drilling program in the
latter part of the year has slowed the decline rate in natural
gas production.
Special charges for the year 1993 included third quarter
charges related to staff reductions as well as the impact of the
U.S. tax rate increase to 35 percent effective January 1, 1993. 
Special charges in 1992 related to the property damage caused by
Hurricane Andrew, staff reductions and financial reserves.

Earnings for both the fourth quarter and year 1993
benefitted from higher marketing margins on the East and Gulf
Coasts of the U.S. during the latter part of the year. Branded
gasoline sales grew during the fourth quarter and year 1993 as
compared to the 1992 periods. Increased sales volumes in this
preferred class of trade contributed to the improved results, as
did lower refinery feedstock prices. Refinery downtime
partially offset these improvements.
Special items for the year 1993 included third quarter
charges for staff reductions, environmental reserves and the U.S.
tax rate increase. The fourth quarter of 1992 included special
charges related to staff reductions and property damage due to a
fire at the Los Angeles refinery.

Lower fourth quarter and year 1993 earnings reflect the
decline in worldwide crude oil prices, which was partially offset
by new production. Production during the fourth quarter was up
18 percent as compared to 1992, mainly in Indonesia from the
Belida field, in the North Sea and the Partitioned Neutral Zone
between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Operating results for the
fourth quarter and year 1992 included benefits of $76 million and
$99 million, respectively, relating to the currency exchange
impact of the Pound Sterling on deferred income taxes. In 1993
there were no such benefits.

<PAGE>

The year 1993 included a third quarter benefit of $169
million related to changes in the U.K. Petroleum Revenue Tax
associated with the taxability of certain items, as well as a tax
rate reduction from 75 percent to 50 percent. Special charges in
1993 related to staff reductions and the writedown of the
carrying value of certain assets, principally in the North
Sea, brought about by a change in the Petroleum Revenue Tax laws.
The year 1992 included a gain related to the favorable
settlement of a Danish tax issue and special charges for staff
reductions.

</TABLE>

Earnings for both the fourth quarter and year 1993 reflect
strong margins and higher refined product sales volumes in the
Caltex operating areas as well as improved margins in Latin
America, particularly Brazil. Caltex recorded non-cash charges
which reduced Texaco's operating results by $36 million and $51
million in the fourth quarter and year 1993, respectively, to
recognize that the market value of inventories is lower than
their LIFO carrying value. The 1992 fourth quarter and year
included benefits of $18 million and $23 million, respectively,
relating to the currency exchange impact of the Pound Sterling on
deferred income taxes. In 1993 there were no such benefits.
Special charges for both years include charges related to
staff reductions and writedowns in the carrying values of certain
assets. The fourth quarter of 1992 also included financial
reserves for the expected resolution of environmental and other
issues.

Lower overall interest costs coupled with the company's
continued expense reduction efforts improved 1993 results. The
fourth quarter of 1992 included the receipt of interest income on
U.K. and Danish tax refunds.
The year 1993 included net tax benefits realizable through
sales of interests in a subsidiary. The fourth quarter of 1993
included a refund of windfall profit taxes with interest, which
was offset by financial reserves primarily relating to oil and
gas issues. The net special charge for the year 1993 related to
staff reductions. The year 1992 included a gain related to the
sale of an interest in a subsidiary and special charges related
to staff reductions and the reduction in the carrying value of
certain assets. 

DISCONTINUED CHEMICAL OPERATIONS
On September 13, 1993, Texaco announced its intent to sell
substantially all of its worldwide chemical operations to an
affiliate of the Jon M. Huntsman Group of Companies. The
memorandum of understanding is being modified and Texaco is
working in cooperation with Huntsman to sell the company's
additives business to a third party. The sale of the
nonadditives portion of the chemical operations is now expected
to close in the first quarter of 1994, and the sale of the
additives business is expected to take place by September 30,
1994. 

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES
Capital and exploratory expenditures for continuing
operations, including equity in such expenditures of affiliates,
were $2,863 million for the year 1993 as compared with $3,004
million for the prior year. Expenditures for continuing
operations for the fourth quarter of 1993 amounted to $998
million versus $1,000 million for the same quarter in 1992.
Expenditures for 1993 declined as compared to 1992,
reflecting the completion of several refinery upgrade projects in
the U.S. which were underway in 1992, mainly by Star Enterprise. 
In addition, international upstream expenditures decreased,
principally in the U.K. sector of the North Sea where new
production was placed onstream.
Offsetting these decreases were increased drilling
activities in the United States, and higher international
refining and marketing investments in the Caltex area.
