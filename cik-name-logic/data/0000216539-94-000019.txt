Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On May 20, 1994, the Company sold its 40% common equity interest in Garden State
Newspapers, Inc. (GSN), along with its GSN Series A and Series C Preferred
Stock, for $63 million in cash. Additionally, in exchange for the GSN Series B
Preferred Stock previously owned by the Company, the Company received 1,200
shares of $25,000 par, 9% Preferred Stock of Denver Newspapers, Inc. (previously
owned by GSN), including accumulated and unpaid dividends of approximately $17.4
million thereon. The stock is valued at $34 million. The sale resulted in a
gain of $91.5 million ($83.3 million after-tax; $3.17 per share). The cash
proceeds from the sale were used immediately to pay down debt ($53 million) and
for investment in short-term fixed income instruments ($5 million). The balance
was applied to transaction costs and utilized for other corporate purposes. The
Company continues to hold a warrant to purchase 40% of the common equity of
Denver Newspapers, Inc.

As more fully explained in Note 3 to its 1993 consolidated financial statements
(incorporated by reference in the Company's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K),
the Company's investment in GSN was reduced to zero in 1991 as a result of a GSN
loss in that year, and the Company has not recognized any equity in GSN's
operating results since then.
