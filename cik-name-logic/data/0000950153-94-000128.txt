GREYHOUND FINANCIAL CORPORATION

ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

PHOENIX, Arizona, July 20, 1994 -- Greyhound Financial Corporation (the
"Company") today announced results for the second quarter and six months ended
June 30, 1994.

Net income for the second quarter of 1994 was $17.5 million compared
with $10.3 million for the comparable period in 1993, an increase of 70% in net
income. The 1994 results include income for a full quarter from Ambassador
Factors ("Ambassador"), the factoring and asset based lending company acquired
on February 14, 1994, and two months of income from TriCon Capital ("TriCon"),
which was acquired on April 30, 1994.

Sam Eichenfield, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
said: "The Company's operations have expanded significantly with the
acquisitions of Ambassador and TriCon in 1994 and the improved results for the
second quarter reflect the contribution of these two operations. Additionally,
we expect our recently announced cost saving initiatives at TriCon, which are
expected to result in personnel reductions of at least 10% over the next
several months, to contribute to the future performance of the Company."

Portfolio quality (nonearning assets as a percent of funds employed)
continues to remain at historic levels and was 3.7% of funds employed at June
30, 1994, an improvement from 3.8% at the

3
<PAGE> 2
end of the first quarter of 1994. Nonearnings, measured as a percent of funds
employed and securitizations, declined further to 3.4% at June 30, 1994.

Interest margins earned, which drive the Company's performance, were
strong at 5.9% of average earning assets. This measurement compares to 5.3%
for the 1993 period and reflects the contributions of the acquisitions made in
1994 as well as the continuing strong returns of the core financial operations.
The strong interest margins more than offset the higher provisions for possible
credit losses and the higher selling, administrative and other operating
expenses (collectively "operating expenses").

The higher loss provisions are attributable to the operations of the
acquisitions made in 1994 and are consistent with the dynamics and loss
experience of the businesses acquired.

The higher operating expenses are attributable primarily to the
acquisitions of TriCon and Ambassador in 1994. The running rate of these
expenses (measured as a percent of interest margins earned) declined to 46.1%
(for the combined entities) in 1994 from 47.5% for the Company (which excluded
TriCon and Ambassador) in 1993. The recently announced cost saving initiatives
are expected to reduce this running rate for expenses even further in the
future.

Earnings also benefited from strong portfolio growth (new business
volume was up by 99% to $699 million for the first six months of 1994 from $352
million for the 1993 period) and securitization gains of $4.0 million ($2.4
million after-tax) generated by TriCon in the second quarter.

Income taxes were higher due to higher tax rates in effect during the
second quarter of 1994 and to higher income before taxes.

Greyhound Financial Corporation, with assets in excess of $5.0
billion, is a Phoenix-based major domestic commercial finance company providing
secured lending to middle-market companies, making loans from $500,000 to $35
million. The Company also offers financing programs to manufacturers,
distributors, vendors and franchisors to facilitate the sale of their products
to end- users.
