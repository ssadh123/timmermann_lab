Item 5. Other Events.

Citizens First Bancorp, Inc. ("Citizens"), National Westminster
Bank Plc, a United Kingdom public limited company ("NatWest"), and NatWest
Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of NatWest
(the "Company"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of March 21, 1994 (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which Citizens will be
merged with and into the Company in a transaction in which the Company will
be the surviving entity (such transaction, the "Merger").

Subject to the limits set forth below, each outstanding share of
common stock of Citizens (the "Common Stock") will be, at the election of the
holder thereof, converted into either:

(i) 0.22034 (the "Exchange Ratio") American Depositary Receipts of
NatWest ("Natwest ADRs"), each NatWest ADR representing six
ordinary shares of NatWest; or

(ii) cash equal to $9.75.

The holders of Common Stock may elect, shortly after the effective
time of the Merger, at their option, to receive cash, NatWest ADRs or a
combination thereof with respect to their shares of Common Stock. No holder
of Common Stock or preferred stock of Citizens will have dissenters' rights. 
After taking into account elections of holders of Common Stock, NatWest ADRs
<PAGE>

that shall be issued in the Merger shall not be less than 5,923,652
(representing approximately 50% of the total consideration to be issued in
the Merger on a fully diluted basis (based on the closing price of NatWest
ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange on March 17, 1994)) nor more than
7,108,383 (the "Maximum ADR Number") (representing approximately 60% of the
total consideration to be issued in the Merger on a fully diluted basis
(based on the closing price of NatWest ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange on
March 17, 1994)). The Agreement provides for a pro rata allocation procedure
for holders of Common Stock that have elected to receive cash, NatWest ADRs
or a combination thereof, as the case may be, in the event of an
oversubscription in respect of cash or NatWest ADRs. For example, in the
event the market value on the New York Stock Exchange of .22034 NatWest ADRs
exceeds $9.75 when holders of Common Stock make their election, it is likely
that a significant portion of elections of holders of Common Stock will be
for NatWest ADRs. In such event, not more than the Maximum ADR Number will
be issued in the Merger. Holders of Common Stock who have elected to receive
NatWest ADRs will be allocated NatWest ADRs pro rata based on the Maximum ADR
Number as compared to the number of NatWest ADRs requested by all such
holders and will receive cash for the shares of Common Stock not converted
into NatWest ADRs. Alternatively, in the event the market value of .22034
NatWest ADRs is less than $9.75 when the holders of Common Stock make their
election, then it is likely that a significant portion of the elections of
holders of Common Stock will be for cash and the pro rata allocation
procedure will result in an allocation of a portion of the shares of Common
Stock, the holders of which chose cash, to be allocated NatWest ADRs instead
of cash. 

Citizens intends to continue paying its regular quarterly cash
dividends on its preferred stock and Common Stock until completion of the
Merger. The Board of Directors has already declared a dividend of $.0425 per
share of Common Stock payable on May 2, 1994. As the Merger is expected to
be completed some time in the Fall, additional dividend payments of $.0425
per share of Common Stock may be paid in August and, to the extent the Merger
has not been consummated prior thereto, in November. In addition, the
Agreement permits Citizens to pay at any time prior to the Merger, an
additional dividend of $.125 per share of Common Stock. Citizens intends to
pay such additional dividend to holders of record of Common Stock immediately
prior to the Merger. If the Merger is not effected, such additional dividend
will not be paid. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no assurance can be
given that any such quarterly dividends or the additional dividend will be
paid.

The Merger is expected to be tax free to the holders of Common
Stock to the extent NatWest ADRs are received, although such receipt of
NatWest ADRs could become taxable under certain circumstances. It is a
condition to the closing of the Merger that White & Case, counsel to
Citizens, render an opinion that the Merger will be treated for United States
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization pursuant to section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the "Code") and that Citizens
and the Company will each be a party to the reorganization pursuant to
Section 368(b) of the Code. 

NatWest ADRs received by holders of Common Stock will be traded on
the New York Stock Exchange and the ordinary shares of NatWest evidenced by
the NatWest ADRs will also be listed on the International Stock Exchange in
London.

The Agreement provides for its termination by Citizens, if its
Board of Directors so determines, in the event the average of the closing
prices on the New York Stock Exchange of NatWest ADRs over the ten
consecutive trading days ending on the tenth day immediately prior to the
anticipated time on which the Merger shall become effective (the "Final
Natwest ADR Price"), is less than $36.25, unless the Company increases the
<PAGE>

Exchange Ratio so that such modified Exchange Ratio times the Final Natwest
ADR Price equals or exceeds $7.987. NatWest and the Company may terminate
the Agreement in the event the Final NatWest ADR Price is less than $30.00. 
Under certain other circumstances Citizens or the Company, as the case may
be, may terminate the Agreement, as specified therein.

The Agreement also provides for the redemption of the issued and
outstanding Citizens Series A $2.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock
and 6.75% convertible debentures due August 1, 2001 on or prior to the
effective time of the Merger. 

The Agreement provides for a termination fee to be paid by Citizens
to the Company in certain circumstances in an amount equal to $17.5 million
plus all costs and expenses (such costs and expenses not to exceed $2.5
million) incurred by the Company and/or NatWest in connection with the
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the approval of the transaction by the holders of a
majority of the shares of Common Stock voting at the meeting called by
Citizens for the purpose of approving the Agreement, the obtaining of certain
regulatory approvals and other closing conditions customary in transactions
of this type. While the precise time of the Merger closing cannot be
determined with certainty, the parties presently anticipate that the closing
will occur in the Fall of 1994.

As a result of the Merger and upon effectiveness of the Merger, all
shares of Common Stock will be delisted from the American Stock Exchange,
will not be listed on any national securities exchange, or quoted in any
inter-dealer quotation system, and will be eligible for termination of
registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the holders of Common Stock will become holders of
NatWest ADRs to the extent they receive NatWest ADRs in the Merger.

The joint press release of Citizens and NatWest issued on March 21,
1994 is attached as Exhibit 1 to this Form 8-K and the Agreement is attached
as Exhibit 2 to this Form 8-K and the First Amendment to the Agreement dated
as of March 28, 1994 is attached as Exhibit 3 to this Form 8-K, each of which
is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary of the Agreement

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NATWEST AND CITIZENS FIRST BANCORP ANNOUNCE MERGER
OF NEW JERSEY BANKS
<PAGE>

JERSEY CITY AND GLEN ROCK, N.J., MARCH 21, 1994 -- The execution of a
definitive merger agreement between National Westminster Bancorp Inc. and
Citizens First Bancorp, Inc. was announced today jointly by NatWest Bancorp
Chairman and CEO John Tugwell and Citizens First Chairman and CEO Allan D.
Nichols.

Under the terms of the $500 million agreement which was signed today,
Citizens First will be combined with National Westminster Bank NJ, a
subsidiary of NatWest Bancorp. With the addition of Citizens First's 50
branch offices, NatWest will increase its overall branch network to 310
offices.

The agreement is subject to approvals by the Federal Reserve Board, other
regulatory authorities and the shareholders of Citizens First. It is
intended that the transaction will be completed as soon as possible after
approvals are obtained and is expected to occur in the fall of 1994.

"We were looking to increase market penetration in New Jersey, and this
acquisition will put us into a leadership position in three additional
counties," said Mr. Tugwell. "Citizens First represents a perfect fit with
our existing operations. We were especially attracted to its strong market
position in Bergen County. We regard the merger as an important strategic
move that will expand our franchise significantly and strengthen revenue
streams. We expect to see the benefits of the merger reflected in enhanced
profitability for NatWest Bancorp over the next few years."

Headquartered in Glen Rock, NJ, Citizens First operates 50 branches. At
year-end 1993, it had assets of $2.6 billion and reported net income of $36.3
million. It has a branch distribution in five New Jersey counties -- with 31
in Bergen, seven in Morris, seven in Ocean, three in Passaic and two in
Hudson.

"The agreement announced today provides a wonderful opportunity for Citizens'
shareholders, customers and employees," said Mr. Nichols. "With the
resources available from NatWest, Citizens' offices will now be able to
provide a more competitive array of services to fulfill the growing financial
needs of our customers. Likewise, new and exciting career opportunities will
be opened for our officers and employees."

Rodney I. Verblaauw, President of Citizens First, stated, "Our shareholders
will experience a significant enhancement of the value of their investment,
almost a fourfold increase in the per share value of Citizens common stock
since the 1992 recapitalization." He also said that "NatWest has a heritage
of extensive community involvement that parallels the tradition of Citizens." 
Both Nichols and Verblaauw noted that the corporate values of the two
companies were quite similar, which should enhance the quality of banking
provided by the new organization.

Following the merger with Citizens First, NatWest Bancorp's branch network
will consist of 183 offices in New Jersey and 127 in New York City, Long
Island and Westchester County. The transaction increases the assets of
NatWest Bancorp to $26 billion and substantially strengthens its commitment
to the New Jersey marketplace. Prior to the merger, NatWest ranked among the
top five banks in deposit market share in Somerset, Hudson, Hunterdon, Cape
May and Atlantic counties. Following the merger, NatWest will also move into
leadership positions in Bergen, Ocean and Morris counties.

Under the terms of the merger, Citizens will be merged into a subsidiary of
National Westminster Bank Plc. Shareholders of Citizens, at their option,
will have the right to have their shares converted into $9.75 per share in
cash or 0.22034 American Depository Receipts ("ADRs") per share. Each ADR
represents six ordinary shares of National Westminster Bank Plc. After
<PAGE>

taking into account shareholder elections, no more than 60% nor less than 50%
of Citizens shares will be converted into ADRs and the remaining Citizens
shares will be converted into cash. The transaction is designed to be tax-
free to Citizens First shareholders electing to receive ADRs. Natwest ADRs,
which are traded on the NYSE, closed at $44.25 on Thursday, March 17, the
price upon which the exchange ratio is based. It is the first banking merger
utilizing ADRs. The price represents 2.47 times the fully diluted book value
as of December 31, 1993.

Although no assurances can be made, Citizens First expects to pay common
stock dividends to shareholders totaling 21 cents before the transaction
closes.

NatWest, which entered the U.S. retail market in 1979 with its purchase of
New York-based National Bank of North America, expanded into New Jersey in
1988 with its purchase of First Jersey National Bank. That merger made it
the first New York-based bank-holding company to enter New Jersey after the
state opened its borders to nationwide interstate banking. A year later it
further strengthened its New Jersey network with the purchase of First
National Bank of Central Jersey.

In London, Derek Wanless, Chief Executive of NatWest Plc, parent of NatWest
Bancorp, said: "This is an important and sensible in-fill acquisition for
Bancorp, whose performance has improved substantially over the last two
years. Achieving winning positions in key markets underpins our approach to
managing the Group's portfolio of businesses and is consistent with our
overall objective of delivering long-term shareholder value." At year-end
1993, NatWest Bancorp posted record net earnings of $298 million.

NatWest Bancorp is a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Westminster Bank
Plc, the London-based international banking and financial services
organization.

provisions of the DGCL.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES

2.01 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Citizens Common Stock:

(a) Capital Stock of the Company. Each share of the capital stock
of the Company issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and shall, subject to subparagraph (d) below, be unchanged
after the Merger, all of which shares shall be issued to NatWest and shall
thereafter constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Company-Owned Shares of
Citizens Common Stock. All shares of Citizens Common Stock that are owned by
Citizens as treasury stock and all shares of Citizens Common Stock owned by
NatWest or any of its Subsidiaries other than any shares of Citizens Common
Stock held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and
similar accounts or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are
beneficially owned by third parties ("Trust Account Shares") and other than
any shares of Citizens Common Stock held by NatWest or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted ("DPC Shares"), 
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of Citizens Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.05
and 2.06, each share of Citizens Common Stock outstanding at the Effective
Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b))
shall be converted into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive, at the election of the holder thereof (but subject to the limits
contained in Section 2.03), either:

(i) a number of ordinary shares of Pound/Sterling 1 each of NatWest
("NatWest Stock") issued credited as fully paid equal to 6
multiplied by .22034 (the "Exchange Ratio"), such NatWest Stock to
<PAGE>

be evidenced by American Depositary Receipts ("NatWest ADRs"), each
NatWest ADR representing six ordinary shares of NatWest (the "Per
Share Stock Consideration"), or

(ii) $9.75 in United States Dollars (the "Per Share Cash
Consideration"),

provided that the number of the NatWest ADRs (the "ADR Amount") that shall be
issued in the Merger shall not be less than 5,923,652 (the "Lower Stock
Amount") or more than 7,108,383 (the "Upper Stock Amount").

At the Effective Time of the Merger, all such shares of Citizens
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration hereinabove
set forth upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
2.04, without interest.

(d) Allotment of Company Stock. In consideration of and in
exchange for the issue to NatWest by the Surviving Corporation of such number
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation as NatWest shall
specify and the cancellation of the shares of Citizens Common Stock, NatWest
shall allot the NatWest Stock represented by the NatWest ADRs to be issued in
the Merger to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.03 of this
Agreement) on behalf of the persons entitled thereto for the purpose of
giving effect to the conversion and exchange referred to in Sections 2.01(c),
2.03 and 2.04.

2.02 No Dissenters' Rights. In accordance with Section 14A:11-1
of the NJBC Act, no holder of Citizens Common Stock or Citizens Preferred
Stock shall have the right to dissent.

2.03 Election and Exchange Procedures. (a) The parties shall
designate an exchange agent to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
purposes of conducting the election procedure and the exchange procedure as
described in Sections 2.03 and 2.04. The Exchange Agent shall act for the
purpose of exchanging certificates representing shares of Citizens Common
Stock as provided in Section 2.01. Promptly following the Effective Time,
NatWest shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or make available to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Citizens Common Stock
(i) a notice and letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of Citizens Common Stock shall pass only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) advising such holder of
the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the
Exchange Agent such certificate or certificates which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Citizens Common Stock in
exchange for either the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Article II and
(ii) an election form in such form as NatWest and Citizens shall mutually
agree ("Election Form").

Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to elect to
receive NatWest ADRs with respect to all shares of such holder's Citizens
Common Stock ("Stock Election Shares"), to elect to receive cash with respect
to all shares of such holder's Citizens Common Stock ("Cash Election Shares")
or to indicate that such holder makes no election ("No Election Shares"). 

Any shares of Citizens Common Stock with respect to which the
holder (or the beneficial owner, as the case may be) shall not have submitted
<PAGE>

to the Exchange Agent, an effective, properly completed Election Form on or
before 5:00 p.m., on the 20th day following the Mailing Date (or such other
time and date as NatWest and Citizens may mutually agree) (the "Election
Deadline") shall also be deemed to be "No Election Shares."

Any such election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election
Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly
completed only if accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affi-
davits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing
all shares of Citizens Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together
with duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. 
Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such
Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election
Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Citizens Common
Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares. 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, NatWest or
the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of NatWest or the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. Neither NatWest nor the Exchange Agent shall be
under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form.

To the extent required the Exchange Agent will requisition from
Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as the Depositary, from time to
time, such number of ADRs as are issuable in respect of shares of Citizens
Common Stock properly delivered to the Exchange Agent.

Within five business days after the Election Deadline, NatWest
shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of
Citizens Common Stock of rights to receive NatWest ADRs or cash in the Merger
in accordance with the Election Form as follows:

(i) Stock Elections Less Than Lower Stock Amount. If the ADR
Amount (on the basis of Election Forms received prior to the Election
Deadline) is less than the Lower Stock Amount, then:

(A) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into and
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the NatWest ADRs,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall select first from among the
holders of No Election Shares and then (if necessary) shall
allocate among all the holders of Cash Election Shares (by the
method of allocation described below), a sufficient number of Cash
Election Shares ("Reallocated Shares") such that the ADR Amount
equals as closely as practicable (but in no event shall it be
below) the Lower Stock Amount, and all Reallocated Shares shall be
converted into and cancelled in exchange for the right to receive
NatWest ADRs, and

(C) the No Election Shares and Cash Election Shares which are
not Reallocated Shares shall be converted into and cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;
or 

(ii) Stock Elections More Than Upper Stock Amount. If the ADR
Amount (on the basis of Election Forms received prior to the Election
Deadline) is greater than the Upper Stock Amount, then:
<PAGE>

(A) all Cash Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
converted into and cancelled in exchange for the right to receive
cash,

(B) the Exchange Agent shall allocate among all the holders
of Stock Election Shares, (by the method of allocation described
below) a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares ("Reallocated
Cash Shares") such that the ADR Amount equals as closely as
practicable the Upper Stock Amount, and all Reallocated Cash Shares
shall be converted into and cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive cash, and

(C) the Stock Election Shares which are not Reallocated Cash
Shares shall be converted into and cancelled in exchange for the
right to receive NatWest ADRs; or

(iii) Stock Elections between Lower Stock Amount and Upper Stock
Amount. If the ADR Amount that would be issued upon conversion into
NatWest ADRs of the Stock Election Shares falls between the Lower Stock
Amount and the Upper Stock Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above
shall not apply and all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive NatWest ADRs and all Cash Election Shares and No
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive cash.

In the event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section
2.03(i)(B) to designate from among all Cash Election Shares, the Reallocated
Shares to receive NatWest ADRs, each holder of Cash Election Shares shall be
allocated a pro rata portion of the remainder of the total Reallocated Shares
over the number of No Election Shares which are Reallocated Shares. In the
event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 2.03 (ii)(B) to
designate from among all holders of Stock Election Shares, the Reallocated
Cash Shares to receive cash, each holder of Stock Election Shares shall be
allocated a pro rata portion of the remainder of the total Reallocated Cash
Shares over the number of No Election Shares which are Reallocated Shares. 

2.04 Additional Exchange Procedures. 

(a) Each holder of shares of Citizens Common Stock that has been
converted into a right to receive the consideration set forth in Section
2.01(c), upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a certificate or
certificates representing such Citizens Common Stock, together with a prop-
erly completed letter of transmittal covering such shares of Citizens Common
Stock will be entitled to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the
Per Share Cash Consideration, as the case may be, in respect of each share of
Citizens Common Stock. Until so surrendered, each share of Citizens Common
Stock shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, or, as the case may be,
the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(b) If any Merger consideration is to be issued to a person other
than the registered holder of the Citizens Common Stock represented by the
certificate or certificates surrendered with respect thereto, it shall be a
condition to such issuance that the certificate or certificates so sur-
rendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such issuance shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
issuance to a person other than the registered holder of such Citizens Common
Stock or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not payable.

(c) As of the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Citizens Common Stock that were
outstanding prior to the Merger. After the Effective Time, certificates
<PAGE>

representing shares of Citizens Common Stock presented to the Surviving Cor-
poration for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
Article II.

(d) At the close of business on the Effective Time, the stock
ledger of Citizens with respect to the issuance of Citizens Common Stock
shall be closed. One year after the Effective Time, any NatWest ADRs or cash
made available to the Exchange Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Citizens Common Stock shall be returned to NatWest upon demand. Any such
holder who has not delivered his shares of Citizens Common Stock to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to NatWest and the Surviving Corporation for issuance of
NatWest ADRs or cash in respect of shares of Citizens Common Stock. Not-
withstanding the foregoing, none of NatWest, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Citizens Common Stock for any
securities delivered or any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property laws. Any NatWest ADRs remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Citizens Common Stock six years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such securities would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity or as is
otherwise provided by applicable law) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be free and clear of any claims or interest or any person
previously entitled thereto.

(e) No dividends, interest or other distributions with respect to
securities of NatWest issuable with respect to Citizens Common Stock shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificates representing Citizens
Common Stock until such certificates are surrendered as provided in this
Section. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
person in whose name the NatWest ADRs representing such securities are
registered, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such
securities on a date subsequent to, and in respect of a record date after,
the Effective Time.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
for a period of ninety (90) days after the date of the Effective Time, owners
of Citizens Common Stock convertible into NatWest ADRs shall be entitled to
vote as holders of shares of NatWest ADRs notwithstanding that such
certificates shall not have been exchanged.

2.05 Fractional ADRs. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional NatWest ADRs shall
be issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would have been entitled
to a fraction of a NatWest ADR shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without
interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Final
NatWest ADR Price (as defined in Section 2.06). No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional NatWest ADR.

2.06 Termination Rights. (a) Citizens shall have the right to
elect to abandon the Merger and, subject to Section 6.01(c), terminate this
Agreement if its Board of Directors so determines, prior to the Effective
Time in the event the Final NatWest ADR Price shall be less than $36.25.

(b) NatWest and the Company shall have the right to elect to
abandon the Merger and terminate this Agreement prior to the Effective Time
in the event the Final NatWest ADR Price shall be less than $30.00.

(c) The Final NatWest ADR Price shall mean the average of the
closing sale prices for NatWest ADRs as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. Composite Transactions Tape (or in the absence thereof from
<PAGE>

such other source upon which NatWest and Citizens shall mutually agree) dur-
ing the ten consecutive days on which shares of NatWest ADRs are traded on
the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE"), ending on the tenth day
immediately prior to the anticipated Effective Time.

2.07 Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters. If, prior to the
Effective Time, NatWest shall declare a stock dividend (other than pursuant
to NatWest's Share Dividend Scheme) or stock distribution upon, or subdivide,
split up, reclassify or combine, the NatWest Stock or declare a stock
dividend or make a distribution on, the NatWest Stock of any security
convertible into NatWest Stock, appropriate adjustment or adjustments will be
made to the Per Share Stock Consideration and the ADR Amount or other
appropriate adjustments, if any.

2.08 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of White & Case (or such other place as the parties
shall mutually agree), as soon as practicable after the last of the
conditions set forth in Article V hereof is fulfilled or waived (subject to
applicable law) but in no event later than the fifth business day thereafter,
or at such other time and place and on such other date as Citizens and the
Company shall mutually agree (the "Closing Date").

2.09 Employee Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option
with respect to Citizens Common Stock (a "Citizens Employee Stock Option")
issued pursuant to the 1983 Incentive Stock Option Plan or the 1985 Stock
Incentive Plan of Citizens (together the "Citizens Option Plans") that is
outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the
difference between the exercise price of such Citizens Employee Stock Option
and the Per Share Cash Consideration for each share of Citizens Common Stock
subject to such Citizens Employee Stock Option.

2.10 Treatment of the 6.75% Debentures and the 6.00% Bonds. On or
prior to the Effective Time, Citizens shall have redeemed each then
outstanding 6.75% convertible subordinated debenture due August 1, 2001 (each
a "6.75% Debenture") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Indentures under which the 6.75% Debentures were issued. The parties hereto
agree that, prior to the Effective Time, they will cooperate with respect to
the treatment of the 6.00% Bonds in connection with the Merger, with the
intent, if permitted by the terms of the indenture pursuant to which such
Bonds were issued, of redeeming such 6.00% Bonds.

2.11 Redemption of Citizens Preferred Stock. On or prior to the
Effective Time, Citizens shall redeem each of its issued and outstanding
shares of Series A $2.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock ("Citizens
Preferred Stock") in accordance with the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of Citizens, and holders of Citizens Preferred Stock shall
thereby be entitled to receive (unless earlier converted into Citizens Common
Stock) $23.00 per share in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends through
the date on which Citizens Preferred Stock is redeemed, without interest.

2.12. Withholding Rights. NatWest shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Citizens Common Stock or Citizens Employee Stock Options
such amounts as NatWest is required under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Citizens Common Stock or
Citizens Employee Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by NatWest.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

3.01 Representations and Warranties of Citizens. Citizens hereby
represents and warrants to NatWest and the Company as follows:

(a) Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power. Each of
Citizens and its Subsidiaries is a corporation (or, in the case of
Citizens First National Bank of New Jersey (the "Bank"), a national
banking association) duly organized, validly existing and in good stand-
ing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and each
such corporation has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. Each of Citizens and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below) on Citizens. Citizens is registered
as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC
Act. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect"
shall mean, with respect to NatWest, the Company, Citizens or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on
the business, results of operations or financial condition of such party
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any such effect
attributable to or resulting from general economic conditions. 

For the purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" shall mean, as to
any Person, any corporation, association or other entity in which such
Person owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the
total outstanding voting securities or 50% or more of the total equity
interest; provided, however, that the term shall not include any such
entity in which such voting securities or equity interest is owned or
controlled in a fiduciary capacity, without sole voting power, or was
acquired in securing or collecting a debt previously contracted in good
faith; and, provided further, that, in the case of Citizens, the term
shall not include Venture Prize, Inc. or Bear Park, Inc.

(b) Authorization and Validity of Agreement. Citizens has full
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform
its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Citizens, and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized and approved by its Board
of Directors. No other corporate action on the part of Citizens is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Citizens and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than the approval of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the shares of Citizens Common Stock voting in
person or by proxy at the special meeting of shareholders called for the
purpose of such vote). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Citizens and is a valid and binding obligation of Citizens
enforceable against Citizens in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles.

(c) Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Citizens
consists of 56,393,972 shares of Citizens Common Stock, no par value,
and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 1993, (1)
<PAGE>

49,859,824 shares of Citizens Common Stock are issued and outstanding,
(2) 1,547,127 shares of Citizens Common Stock are reserved for issuance

agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which NatWest or
the Company or any of their material Subsidiaries is a party, or by
which they or their respective properties or assets may be bound, except
for, in the case of clauses (3) and (4), filings, notices, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which, and violations, breaches,
<PAGE>

defaults, conflicts and liens which, in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on NatWest or on the ability of the parties
hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither
NatWest nor the Company have any reason to believe that they will be
unable to obtain each and every required consent and approval referred
to in this Section 3.02(d) so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated on or prior to March 31, 1995.

(e) Company Reports and Financial Statements. As of their
respective dates, none of the Reports of NatWest contained or will

were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial
statements of NatWest included in its annual reports to shareholders
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United Kingdom applied on a consistent basis (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs and profits of NatWest and its Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and for the periods then ended (subject to normal year
end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim results). The
financial information contained in the interim unaudited statements of
the results of operations of NatWest and its Subsidiaries for the six
months ended June 30, 1993 and June 30, 1994 have been, and will be, as
the case may be, prepared with all due care and attention and in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
Kingdom or practice consistent with those used in the preparation of the
audited consolidated accounts of NatWest and its Subsidiaries insofar as
appropriate in the preparation of an interim unaudited statement.

(f) Absence of Certain Changes. Except as previously disclosed in
the Reports of NatWest or otherwise provided to Citizens in writing

tax pursuant to Section 4975(a) of the Code; (v) no material liability,
claim, action or litigation has been made, commenced or, to the
knowledge of Bancorp, threatened, with respect to any Plan involving any
employees of Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for benefits

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation); (vi) with respect to all Plans
which are subject to Title IV of ERISA, as of the most recent actuarial
<PAGE>

valuation prepared for each such Plan, the aggregate present value of

value of the assets allocable thereto; (vii) no Plan is a Multiemployer
Plan; and (viii) neither Bancorp nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
advised by any Multiemployer Plan that it has any withdrawal liability
under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan, nor is Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries aware of any such
withdrawal liability.

tory authority and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it

4.02 Confirming Accounting and Reserve Policies and Restructuring

required by US GAAP and applicable laws, rules and regulations, Citizens
recognizes that the Company has adopted different loan, accrual and reserve
policies (including loan classifications and levels of reserves for possible
loan losses). From and after the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, Citizens and the Company shall consult and cooperate with each other
with respect to conforming (subject to the conditions set forth in Section
4.02(d)), as specified in a written notice from the Company to Citizens based
upon such consultation, Citizens' loan, accrual and reserve policies to those
policies of the Company.

(b) In addition, from and after the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, Citizens and the Company shall consult and cooperate with
each other with respect to determining (subject to the conditions set forth
in Section 4.02(d)), as specified in a written notice from the Company to
Citizens, based upon such consultation, appropriate accruals, reserves and
charges to establish and take in respect of excess facilities and equipment
capacity, severance costs, litigation matters, write-off or write-down of
various assets and other appropriate accounting adjustments taking into
account the Company's business plan following the Merger.

(c) The Company and Citizens shall consult and cooperate with each
other with respect to determining the amount and the timing of recognition
for financial accounting purposes of the expenses of the Merger and the

Merger.

(d) At the request of the Company, Citizens shall, prior to the
Closing, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) establish and take such
reserves and accruals as the Company shall reasonably request to conform, on
a mutually satisfactory basis, Citizens' loan, accrual and reserve policies
to the Company's policies and (ii) establish and take such accruals, reserves
and charges in order to implement such policies in respect of excess
facilities and equipment capacity, severance costs, litigation matters,
write-off or write-down of various assets and other appropriate accounting
adjustments, and to recognize for financial accounting purposes such expenses
of the Merger and restructuring charges related to or to be incurred in con-
nection with the Merger; provided, however, that Citizens shall not be
obligated to take any such action pursuant to this Section 4.02(d) unless and
until (x) the Company specifies its request in a writing delivered to
Citizens, and acknowledges that all conditions to its obligation to
consummate the Merger set forth in Sections 5.01 and 5.02 have been irre-
vocably waived or irrevocably satisfied and (y) Citizens acknowledges that
the conditions to its obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in
Sections 5.01 and 5.03 have been satisfied or waived by Citizens. Citizens
shall not be required to take any such action that is not consistent with US
GAAP, that would make any of its representations or warranties untrue or
otherwise impair Citizens' ability to perform its obligations hereunder, that
impairs its regulatory capital, that is inconsistent with any formal or
<PAGE>

informal undertaking by Citizens to any banking regulatory agency which has
been disclosed in writing to the Company prior to the date hereof, or which
is inconsistent with any requirement hereinafter imposed on Citizens by any
bank regulatory agency.

(e) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, Citizens shall, and shall cause its officers, directors and
employees to, cooperate with and assist the Company in the formulation of a
plan of integration for the Company and Citizens.

4.03 Forbearance By Citizens, NatWest and the Company. During the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, without the
prior written consent of the other party, none of NatWest, the Company or
Citizens will take any action that would (a) delay or adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of Citizens, NatWest or the Company to obtain
any necessary approvals, consents or waivers of any governmental authority
required for the transactions contemplated hereby or (b) adversely affect in
any material respect the ability of Citizens, NatWest or the Company to
perform its covenants and agreements on a timely basis under this Agreement.

4.04 Access to Citizens. Citizens shall, upon reasonable notice,
afford to NatWest and its counsel, accountants and other authorized repre-
sentatives, reasonable access during normal business hours to its properties,
books and records in order that NatWest may have the opportunity to make such
investigations as it shall desire of the affairs of Citizens and its
Subsidiaries. Citizens agrees to cause its agents, officers and employees to
furnish such additional financial and operating data and other information
and respond to such inquiries as NatWest shall from time to time reasonably
request. Citizens shall also permit employees and agents of NatWest to have
reasonable access during normal business hours to the properties and
facilities of Citizens and its Subsidiaries including, without limitation, to
customer account data and files of Citizens to facilitate the planning and
installation of data communications equipment and other technological
interfaces between the systems of the Company and those of Citizens and its
Subsidiaries. Neither Citizens nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information (i) with respect to any customer
of Citizens who is a customer of NatWest or any of its affiliates or (ii)
when such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of
Citizens' customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Citizens or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. 
Citizens will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.04 to the contrary, neither

to have access to the properties and facilities of Citizens and its
Subsidiaries until the thirtieth day following the date of this Agreement
without the prior consent of Citizens.

Company pursuant to Section 4.04 hereof shall be subject to the provisions of

Confidentiality Agreement as if they were original signatories thereto.

and the Company, prepare and file with the Commission a preliminary Proxy

Commission in connection therewith and to furnish all information required to
prepare the definitive Proxy Statement (including, without limitation,

independent public accountants). Citizens will cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders and, if necessary, after the Proxy Statement
shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or
supplemented proxy material and, if required in connection therewith,
resolicit proxies. Citizens will not use any proxy material in connection
with the meeting of its stockholders with respect to the approval of this
Agreement to which the Company shall reasonably object.

4.07 Registration Statement; Stock Exchange Listing. NatWest
will, in cooperation with Citizens, prepare and file with the Commission the
Registration Statement with respect to the NatWest Stock (which Registration

Merger and shall use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to
be declared effective by the Commission as promptly as practicable. NatWest
will not use in the Registration Statement any information to which Citizens
shall reasonably object. NatWest and the Company shall promptly take any
action required to be taken under state securities laws and the securities
exchanges on which the NatWest Stock will be listed in connection with the
issuance of NatWest Stock. NatWest shall use its best efforts to list on the
NYSE upon official notice of issuance, and to obtain admission to the
Official List of the International Stock Exchange the NatWest Stock and/or
the NatWest ADRs to be issued in the Merger.

4.08 Stockholder Approval. Citizens, acting through its Board of
Directors, shall call a special meeting of the holders of Citizens Common

Board of Directors that holders of Citizens Common Stock approve and adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger.

4.09 Reasonable Best Efforts. Each of Citizens, NatWest and the
Company shall, and Citizens and NatWest, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken as promptly as practicable, all appropriate action, and to
make, or cause to be made as promptly as practicable, all filings necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain,
promptly, all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of governmental authorities as are necessary for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fulfill the conditions to the Merger. With respect to any such actions or
filings, each party shall consult and cooperate with the other prior to
taking any such actions or making any such filings and, in the case of any
such filings, to afford reasonable consideration of the comments of the other
party. NatWest and the Company agree to cooperate fully in obtaining the
consents described in Section 5.02(f).

Agreement and in any event within five days thereof, each of Citizens and
each of its Subsidiaries shall notify the New Jersey Department of

taking any actions required in connection therewith) to obtain (i) all
letters, declarations and no further action letters required under applicable
environmental laws or (ii) a remediation agreement from the NJDEPE permitting
completion of the Merger prior to obtaining a no further action letter under
the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act ("ISRA"), and take all other

shall include, but not be limited to, providing a "remediation funding
<PAGE>

source" as that term is defined in ISRA, in connection with any remediation
agreement, remediation plan or other arrangement with the NJDEPE pursuant to
ISRA in connection with the Merger.

4.11 Acquisition Proposals. Citizens shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall instruct and otherwise use its best efforts to cause
its respective officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors or other
representatives or consultants not to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage,
solicit or initiate any proposals or offers from any person relating to any
acquisition or purchase of all or a material amount of the assets of, or any
securities of, or any merger, consolidation or business combination with,
Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries (such transactions are referred to herein
as "Acquisition Transactions") or (ii) except as the Board of Directors of
Citizens deems necessary, on the advice of outside counsel, in the exercise
of its fiduciary obligations under applicable law, participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any in-
formation with respect to, an Acquisition Transaction; provided, however,
that nothing contained in this Section 4.11 shall restrict or prohibit any
disclosure by Citizens that is required on the advice of outside counsel in
any document to be filed with the Commission after the date of this Agreement
or any disclosure that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors of Citizens
on advice of outside counsel, is otherwise required under applicable law. 
Citizens shall promptly notify the Company orally and in writing of any
proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition Transaction or any inquiries with
respect thereto.

4.12 Antitakeover Statutes. Citizens will take all reasonable
steps to exempt NatWest and the Company from the requirements of any state
antitakeover law by action of its board of directors or otherwise.

4.13 Employee Benefits. (a) The Company hereby unconditionally
agrees to, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to, honor and continue to
perform, without modification, all contracts and agreements (including but
not limited to, employment, consulting and severance agreements but excluding
any Plan (as defined in Section 3.01(j)) of Citizens or any of its
Subsidiaries authorized by Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
date of this Agreement which apply to any current or former employee or
current or former director of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries, provided
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require the Company to honor
or continue to perform any such contract or agreement with respect to which
there is an actual pending litigation prior to the execution of this
Agreement. In accordance with the terms of such contracts and agreements,
the Company hereby assumes, as of the Effective Time, all of Citizens'
obligations under such contracts and agreements and commitments. The
Company agrees for itself and its Subsidiaries that the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby are
both a "Change in Control" as defined in the change in control agreements
entered into between the Bank and its officers, a list of which has been
provided in writing to the Company by Citizens (the "Change in Control
Agreements").

(b) With respect to benefits payable (i) pursuant to the Citizens
First National Bank of New Jersey Benefit Equalization Plan and (ii) to
employees who shall have retired from Citizens and its Subsidiaries before
the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
take any action to reduce such benefits, including, without limitation,
retiree health benefits. The Company and NatWest agree to honor all benefits
payable pursuant to the Citizens First Bancorp, Inc. Director Retirement
Plan. All Citizens Employees (as hereinafter defined) shall be provided with
retiree health benefits to the same extent as those provided upon retirement
in the future to employees of Bancorp who were employed on December 31, 1993. 
Employees of Citizens and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Citizens Employees") who are terminated on or within one year
<PAGE>

after the Effective Time (except for Citizens Employees terminated for
engaging in criminal conduct in connection with their employment) shall be
provided, in addition to all other applicable benefits (except severance and
similar termination benefits), the following existing Citizens severance and
other benefits: (i) one month of salary for every five years of service or
partial five year period plus, in the case of Senior Vice Presidents or above
of Citizens or any of its Subsidiaries (at the date of this Agreement), two
months of salary; and (ii) continuation of health benefits during the period
when any severance payments are made and the provision of COBRA benefits
thereafter.

(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements maintained by or contributed to by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Surviving Corporation), the
Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause such plan, program
or arrangement to treat the prior service with Citizens or its Subsidiaries
of each person who is a Citizens Employee as service rendered to the Company
or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to
participate and for special benefits and vesting thereunder. The Company or
the Company's Subsidiaries shall cause their respective tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plans to be amended to recognize, for purposes of vesting,
eligibility and benefit accrual thereunder, each Citizens Employee's
compensation and term of service with Citizens.

(d) Each Citizens Employee who becomes an employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each a "Continued
Employee") shall be entitled, as an employee of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries, to participate in whatever employee benefit plans, as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or whatever nonqualified employee benefit or
deferred compensation plans, stock option, bonus or incentive plans or other
employee benefit or fringe benefit programs, that may be in effect generally
for employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries from time to time ("Company
Plans") if such Continued Employee shall be eligible for participation
therein and otherwise shall not be participating in a similar plan which
continues to be maintained by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. 
Continued Employees will be eligible to participate on the same basis as
similarly situated employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries. All such
participation shall be subject to such terms of such plans as may be in
effect from time to time.

(e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause the merger of the Employees' Retirement Plan of Citizens First
National Bank of New Jersey (the "Retirement Plan") into the National
Westminster Bancorp Retirement Plan (the "NatWest Retirement Plan"), in
accordance with Section 414(1) of the Code, so that each participant in the
Retirement Plan would, if the merged plan then terminated, receive a benefit
which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have received
immediately before the merger if the Retirement Plan had then terminated,
notwithstanding the funded status of the Retirement Plan. The benefit of
each Continued Employee under the NatWest Retirement Plan shall be the
greater of (i) the accrued benefit he would have received under the
Retirement Plan had he terminated employment immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) his accrued benefit under the NatWest Retirement Plan
taking into account his years of service and compensation with Citizens or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) The provisions of this Section 4.13 are expressly intended to
be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each current
and former director, officer and employee of Citizens and its Subsidiaries
and his or her heirs and representatives.

4.14 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) 
From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall and shall cause its
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries to indemnify and advance costs and expenses (including reason-
able attorneys' fees, disbursements and expenses) and hold harmless each
present and former director and/or officer of Citizens or its Subsidiaries
determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, settlements or liabilities (collectively, "Costs")
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each
a "Claim"), arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Citizens would have been
permitted under New Jersey law and its Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such person (and also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law).

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 4.14(a), shall notify the Company within forty-five days of the
Indemnified Party's receipt of a notice of any Claim, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve the Company of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party if such failure does not materially prejudice the indem-
nifying party. In the event of any Claim (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) the Company shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and the Company shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Company elects not to assume such defense
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which
raise conflicts of interest between the Company and the Indemnified Parties,
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the
Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received;
provided, however, that the Company shall be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified
Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and
(iii) the Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If such
indemnity with respect to any Indemnified Party is unenforceable against the
Company, then the Company and the Indemnified Party shall contribute to the
amount payable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect relative
faults and benefits.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Citizens (provided
that the Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to such directors and officers) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time.

(d) If the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving

(a) by mutual consent of Citizens, NatWest and the Company;

(b) by Citizens or the Company, if the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or prior to March 31, 1995, unless the failure to so

tion contained in this Agreement by the party seeking to so terminate;

(c) by Citizens, whether before or after the Merger has been
approved by Citizens' stockholders, upon five business days' prior

or agreements contained in this Agreement when this Agreement was
terminated. For purposes of this Section 6.03 "Acquisition
Transaction" shall mean (x) a merger or consolidation, or any similar
transaction involving Citizens, (y) a purchase, lease or other
