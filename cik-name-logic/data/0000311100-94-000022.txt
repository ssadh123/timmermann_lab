Item 5. Other Events.

On December 31, 1979, NB Corporation, a Virginia corporation ("NB") and 
Southern Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("SBI") merged into 
Jefferson Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("Jefferson"). In such 
merger, Jefferson issued shares of its common stock in conversion of all the 
outstanding shares of stock in NB and SBI (and the formerly outstanding shares 
of Jefferson, which were owned by NB and SBI, were canceled).

Immediately before the merger, NB had one class of securities, common 
stock, registered under Section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 
(File No. 0-4533), and SBI had two classes of securities, common stock and 
$3.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock, registered under such Section 12 
(File No. 0-5443).

The shares of Jefferson issued in the merger were registered under the 
Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-14 (Registration No. 2-64185). The 
registration statement contains further information concerning this 
transaction, including the exchange ratios, the sale of fractional shares, and 
rights of dissenting shareholders of SBI. (Such dissenters held an aggregate 
of 2,905 shares of preferred stock of SBI and an aggregate of 12 shares of 
common stock of SBI.)

By virtue of Rule 12g-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (the "Act"), Registrant's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the 
"Common Stock"), is deemed registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Act. In 
order to facilitate the incorporation by reference of certain information into 
Registrant's future filings under the securities laws, Registrant is providing 
the following description of the Common Stock.

Registrant is authorized to issue 32,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of 
which 15,202,050 were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 1994. 
Registrant is also authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 
$10.00 par value, in series. No shares of preferred stock are issued and 
outstanding. The Board of Directors of Registrant could at any time, without 
additional approval of the holders of Registrant's Common Stock, issue either 
authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock in series or additional 
authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock. There are at present no plans 
to issue shares of preferred stock.

Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if 
declared by the Board of Directors of Registrant out of funds legally 
available therefor, but only after payment of all required dividends on any 
outstanding preferred stock. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to cast one 
vote for each share held of record and are not entitled to cumulate votes for 
the election of directors or any other matter. The holders of Common Stock 
have voting powers on all matters requiring approval of shareholders, subject 
to the voting rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued 
and outstanding to the extent provided in the applicable articles of serial
designation or otherwise pursuant to the Virginia Stock Corporation Act. If 
Registrant were liquidated, after payment of all debts and expenses, the 
remaining assets of Registrant would be distributed to the holders of Common 
Stock ratably, subject to the prior payment of any liquidation preferences to 
any holders of preferred stock. The holders of Common Stock do not have 
preemptive rights to subscribe for any additional securities issued by 
Registrant.
