ITEM 2.

On August 12, 1994, JCJ, Inc. ("JCJ"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The
Actava Group Inc. (the "Company"), sold its interest in Qualex Inc. ("Qualex")
to Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak"), and both JCJ and the Company entered into a
covenant not to compete and a release in favor of Kodak in exchange for payments
in cash and notes totaling $150 million. Qualex is a wholesale photofinishing
company created in 1988 through a merger of the Company's and Kodak's
photofinishing operations. Qualex had been jointly owned by the Company or an
affiliate and Kodak since its formation.

JCJ sold to Kodak its 50% ownership interest in Qualex in exchange for a
total purchase price of $136 million. The purchase price consisted of a $36
million cash payment on August 12, 1994 and a $100 million note, payable in two
installments of $50 million each, without interest, on February 13, 1995 and
August 11, 1995. In the second quarter of 1994, the Company provided for an
anticipated loss of $37.9 million on the sale of its interest in Qualex. Because
the principal amount due under the note does not bear interest, the Company
discounted the value of the note to $92.8 million for financial reporting
purposes and will record imputed interest income of $7.2 million over the term
of the note.

In addition, in exchange for a cash payment on August 12, 1994 of $10
million, both JCJ and the Company entered into a covenant-not-to-compete with
Kodak, under which both JCJ and the Company have agreed not to engage in certain
activities for a period which ends on August 12, 1999. Both JCJ and the Company
also executed a release in favor of Kodak with regard to certain items arising
under the Shareholders' Agreement dated as of December 7, 1987, as amended,
between the Company and Kodak in exchange for a $4 million cash payment on
August 12, 1994. The consideration for the Company's interest in Qualex and the
covenant-not-to-compete and release were determined by arm's length negotiation.

There was no material relationship, other than the joint ownership of
Qualex and related matters, between Kodak and the Company or any of its
affiliates, any director or officer of the Company or any associate of such
director or officer.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On June 8, 1993, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired
substantially all the assets of Diversified Products Corporation ("DP") for a
net purchase price consisting of $11.6 million in cash, the issuance of
1,090,909 shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Acquisition Shares") valued
at $12 million, and the assumption or payment of certain liabilities including
trade payables and a revolving credit facility. The Company also entered into an
agreement providing the holder of the Acquisition Shares (the "Holder") with the
right to receive additional payments depending upon the value of the Acquisition
Shares over a period of not longer than one year from the purchase date. The
agreement gives the Holder the right under certain circumstances to require the
Company to purchase the Acquisition Shares at a price equal to $11.00 per share.
The Company recorded the issuance of the Acquisition Shares as redeemable common
stock in the amount of $12 million. The repurchase of the Acquisition Shares
will not affect the cost recorded by Actava for DP since the cost of DP will be
increased by the amount of the cash payment and simultaneously reduced by the
same amount due to a corresponding adjustment to the respective redeemable
common stock. The right of the Holder to receive additional payments of cash
became exercisable after June 8, 1994 and would have expired if not exercised on
or before August 7, 1994. On August 3, 1994, the Holder agreed to extend the
exercise date to February 7, 1995 in exchange for the payment by Actava of a
$435,000 fee and an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $12.0 million
which is available and payable to the Holder on February 17, 1995 upon demand
and tender of the Acquisition Shares. On August 17, 1994, an amendment to the
Shareholder Rights Agreement dated June 8, 1993 between the Company and
Westinghouse Electric Corporation was executed to confirm the August 3, 1994
agreement. A copy of the amendment is herewith filed as an exhibit.
