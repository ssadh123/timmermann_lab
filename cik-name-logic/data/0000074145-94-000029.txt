Item 5. Other Events

Reference is made to Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Form
10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1994, regarding the rate
application filed on August 9, 1994, before the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission (the "Commission"). 

On October 26, 1994, the Commission issued an order reducing
the Company's electric rates by approximately $15 million
annually, effective January 1995. On October 26, 1994, the
Company issued the following press release: 

OG&E TO CUT BILLS $15 MILLION
-----------------------------

The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has
approved a proposal to reduce bills for OG&E
Electric Services' customers by about $15
million a year. The new lower bills take
effect January 1, 1995. Residential
customers will save about $2.4 million a
year, with the remainder of the reduction
directed toward making OG&E a more
competitive option for industrial and
commercial customers.

The $15 million savings comes largely
from OG&E's recent redesign and related
streamlining efforts. The company redesigned
operations to become more cost-efficient and
find ways of improving service to customers.

"It was just last August that OG&E
originally filed a request with the
Commission to lower bills, and now we have a
final order," said OG&E Chairman and
President James G. Harlow Jr. "The
Commission, staff and other parties involved
should be commended for working with such
speed to ensure customers bills are lowered
as soon as possible."

"When this $15 million is combined with
a rate reduction from earlier this year plus
the enormous savings from the company's
successful fuel-management efforts, all
customers will see a substantial savings,"
said Harlow.

"The combined savings for the average
residential customer will be about $62 a
year. For commercial and industrial
customers, who use large amounts of energy,
the combined savings will be enough to have a
meaningful impact on their ability to compete
and grow."
