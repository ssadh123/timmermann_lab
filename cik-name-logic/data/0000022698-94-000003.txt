COMSAT TO ACQUIRE RADIATION SYSTEMS, INC.
RADIATION SYSTEMS REPORTS 2ND QUARTER RESULTS

BETHESDA, Md. COMSAT Corporation (NYSE:CQ) has entered into

a definitive merger agreement for the acquisition of Radiation

Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:RADS), a Sterling, Va.-based designer,

manufacturer and integrator of satellite earth stations, advanced

antennas and other turnkey systems for telecommunications, radar,

air traffic control and military uses.

Following the merger, COMSAT's existing systems integration

business, COMSAT Technology Services (CTS), will be combined with

Radiation Systems, Inc. (RSi) to form COMSAT RSI. COMSAT RSI

will pursue opportunities in the high-growth wireless

communications market. Offering integrated systems and products,

COMSAT RSI will target international and domestic markets that

include cellular, PCS and VSAT antenna technology.

"By combining the core competencies of CTS and RSi, the new

company will provide comprehensive solutions to customers with

sophisticated wireless communications needs," said Bruce L.

Crockett, President and CEO of COMSAT.

"Wireless communications presents a unique business

opportunity for the company and makes this merger a natural fit,"

PAGE 5
<PAGE>

said Richard E. Thomas, Chairman, President and CEO of Radiation

Systems, Inc. "Our business experience, manufacturing skills and

antenna expertise will blend with COMSAT's international

reputation and sharpened systems integration abilities to produce

a new, combined business that will be a major force in the

international marketplace." Thomas will head COMSAT RSI, which 

will leverage the resources of COMSAT Laboratories, a world-

renowned center for communications satellite research and

development.

Under the merger agreement, RSi will be merged with a wholly

owned subsidiary of COMSAT and each share of Radiation Systems'

common stock will be exchanged for $18.25 in COMSAT common stock,

based on the average closing price of COMSAT stock during 20

trading days ending five trading days before the closing of the

transaction. However, in no event would a share of Radiation

Systems common stock be exchanged for less than 0.638 or more

than 0.780 shares of COMSAT common stock. Radiation Systems has

approximately eight million shares outstanding, giving the

transaction an approximate value of $150 million. 

The merger is subject to the approval of Radiation Systems'

shareholders, receipt of all required government approvals and

compliance with other customary conditions. A registration

statement relating to the offering of COMSAT common stock to RSi

shareholders will be filed with the SEC. The offering will be

PAGE 6
<PAGE>

made only by means of a prospectus which will be sent, together

with a proxy statement, to RSi shareholders, who are expected to

vote on the merger during the second quarter of 1994.

COMSAT currently owns 4.9 percent of Radiation Systems' stock. 

Radiation Systems may be required to pay COMSAT up to $7.5

million if the transaction is not completed under certain

circumstances. Radiation Systems also has granted COMSAT, as

part of the transaction, an irrevocable option that can be

exercised under certain circumstances to purchase up to an

additional 15 percent of Radiation Systems' outstanding common

stock, at an exercise price of $18.25 per share.

It is a condition to the merger that it be treated as a

pooling of interests for accounting purposes. It is also

expected that the merger will qualify as a tax-free

reorganization. At the current trading price of COMSAT stock,

and excluding non-recurring transaction costs, COMSAT expects

that the acquisition will not have a materially dilutive effect

on 1994 earnings per share.

Financial advisors for the transaction are Goldman, Sachs &

Co. for COMSAT and Alex. Brown & Sons Incorporated for Radiation

Systems.

RADIATION SYSTEMS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

Radiation Systems, Inc. today reported net income of

$1,304,000 (16 cents per share) for the three months ended

December 31, 1993, a decline of 42 percent from net income of

PAGE 7
<PAGE>

$2,251,000 (27 cents per share) in the second quarter of last

fiscal year. Total revenues for the second quarter were $27.0

million compared to $29.3 million in the last fiscal year. For

the six months ended December 31, 1993, net income was $3.7

million (45 cents per share) on total revenues of $53.9 million,

compared to net income of $4.8 million (58 cents per share) on

revenues of $61.8 million for the same period the prior year.

Radiation Systems attributed the decline in net income largely

to the delay in the settlement of its business interruption

insurance claim from the previously reported tornado which struck

its division in Largo, Florida. Radiation Systems has previously

received $827,000, and $2,996,000 which have been included in

total revenues for the three month period ended September 30,

1993 and the year ended June 30, 1993 (including $802,000 in the

three month period ended December 31, 1992), respectively. 

Radiation Systems anticipates that it will reach a settlement for 

the current period claim by the end of the fiscal year at which

time the additional revenue will be recognized.

Also, additional expenses incurred in two contracts of the

Universal Antenna Division have contributed to a decline in

pretax operating margins in the second quarter.

<PAGE>

New orders for the quarter ended December 31, 1993 were $35.6

million including the previously announced $18 million contract

for telecommunications systems in Kuwait. Radiation Systems also

received notice that its $6.2 million contract with Raytheon for

the Ground Based Radar project had been terminated for

convenience by the U.S. Government, resulting in net bookings for

the quarter of $29.4 million. Total backlog of unfilled orders

on December 31, 1993 was $133.1 million compared to a backlog of

$130.8 million on September 30, 1993 and $142.1 million on

December 31, 1992.

Mr. Thomas said that, with the formation of COMSAT RSI, he

expects to realize scale economies, critical mass and increased

marketing success, particularly in the high-growth international

markets.

information and entertainment-distribution services company. It
