ST. PAUL MOURNS DEATH OF VICE CHAIRMAN FAUSTIN A. PIPAL

Chicago, IL, January 18, 1994 -- St. Paul Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPBC), the
holding company for Chicago-based St. Paul Federal Bank For Savings, mourns the
passing of Faustin A. Pipal, former Chairman of its Board of Directors. Mr.

School, Mr. Pipal held the position of Vice President-Operations with Talman
Federal Savings and Loan Association (currently LaSalle Talman Bank, F.S.B.).

In addition to his distinguished career within the financial services industry,
Mr. Pipal was perhaps best known for his commitment to improving living
standards and the overall quality of life within the local community. At the
time of his death, Mr. Pipal served as a director of the Austin Career

founder and former chairman of the Chicago Area Renewal Effort Services
Corporation (RESCORP), as well as a former director of Illinois Benedictine

non-degreed Certificate of Management program. He served from 1985 through
1992 as a trustee of the Adler School of Professional Psychology (Chicago).

"Faustin Pipal lived a full and exemplary life, devoted to the community, the
financial services industry, his country and, above all, to his family and to
his religion," said Joseph C. Scully, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, who succeeded Mr. Pipal as CEO in 1982 and as Chairman in 1989. "His
wise counsel and leadership in St. Paul's development contributed much to our
heritage of success and will be deeply missed."

Mr. Pipal was a Knight of Malta. He was a past president of the Federal
Savings and Loan Council of Illinois, past director of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Chicago, and was a member of the Illinois Bar Association. Mr. Pipal
was a member of St. John of the Cross Parish in Western Springs, Illinois. In
addition, he served proudly as a Naval aviator during World War II.

Mr. Pipal is survived by his wife, Florence C. Pipal, a registered nurse at
Hinsdale Hospital; four children; three step-children; and eight grandchildren.
