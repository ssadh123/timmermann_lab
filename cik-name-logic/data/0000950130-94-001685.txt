This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed by Reliance Group Holdings,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On November 28, 1994, Reliance Insurance Company, the Company's principal
property and casualty insurance subsidiary ("Reliance"), received an order from
the outgoing insurance commissioner of California ordering Reliance to pay
refunds to its policyholders under California Proposition 103 totaling
$44,751,102, plus interest of 10% from May 8, 1989 through the date of payment.
Reliance understands that similar orders have been issued to 27 other insurance
companies, with the commissioner seeking a total of $1.25 billion in refunds
from the 28 carriers.

Reliance believes that, overall, it did not earn a fair rate of return on
its California business, and intends to contest vigorously the refund order and 
the application to Reliance of the regulations pursuant to which it was issued.
The validity of the implementation of California's Proposition 103 rate rollback
requirement is being appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States by
another insurance company.
