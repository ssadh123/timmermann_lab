September 26, 1994, Houston, Texas... Reading & Bates Corporation
(RB-NYSE) announced today that a subsidiary of the Company has purchased
the second-generation semisubmersible BENVRACKIE from Ben Line Atlantic
Limited for $5.6 million in cash. The unit, an Aker H-3 design built in
1976, is currently "warm stacked" in the Cromarty Firth in Scotland. The
Company plans to contribute the unit to the new joint venture company with
DeepTech International, Inc. as previously announced. This venture is
being formed to acquire and operate semisubmersible drilling units to be
converted for use as floating production systems (FPS's) in the Flextrend 
and Deepwater areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Paul B. Loyd, Jr., Reading & Bates Chairman and CEO said, "This is an
important step in advancing our strategy to increase activity in the
floating production sector. The Aker H-3 design is well suited for 
conversion to floating production service, and the current depressed
market worldwide for second-generation semis provided us the opportunity
to obtain an excellent conversion candidate at a very attractive price.
Although our inspection team found the unit to be in very good condition,
we do not have any plans to re-activate the vessel as a drilling unit. It
will most likely be utilized to develop one of the discoveries by Tatham
Offshore, Inc., an affiliate of DeepTech, in the U.S. Gulf, or it would
certainly be suitable for developments currently being planned by several
other domestic and international operators."

Reading & Bates is a New York Stock Exchange listed company,
providing offshore drilling services throughout the world. Its wholly
owned subsidiary, Reading & Bates Development Co., provides technical, 
construction and project management services to the upstream offshore oil 
and gas industry worldwide.
