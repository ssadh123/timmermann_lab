Capital Stock Classes

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation has the authority to issue is 51,000,000 shares. The shares are
divided into two classes as follows:

1. 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value One Cent ($0.01) per
share (Preferred Stock), and

2. 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value Five Cents ($0.15) per
share (Common Stock).

The designations of voting powers, preferences, preemptive rights,
options and other special rights and qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of the above classes of stock are as follows:

I. Preferred Stock

1. Issuance in Series.

Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series at such
time or times, and for such consideration or considerations as the Board of
Directors may determine. All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock will
be identical with each other in all respects, except that shares of one series
issued at different times may differ as to dates from which dividends thereon
may be cumulative. All series will rank equally and be identical in all
respects, except as permitted by the following provisions of paragraph 2 of
this Division I.

2. Authority of the Board with Respect to Series.

The Board of Directors is authorized, at any time and from time to time,
to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series
with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or
other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as
are stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the
issue thereof adopted by the Board of Directors, and if not restricted by this
Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment thereto including, but not
limited to, determination of any of the following:

(a) the distinctive serial designation and the number of shares
constituting a series;

(b) the dividend rate or rates, whether dividends are cumulative and, if
so, from which date, the payment date or dates for dividends, and the
participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to dividends;

(c) the voting powers, full or limited, if any, of the shares of the
series;

(d) whether the shares are redeemable and, if so, the price or prices at
which, and the terms and conditions under which, the shares may be redeemed;

(e) the amount or amounts payable upon the shares in the event of
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation prior to any payment or distribution of the assets of the
Corporation to any class or classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior
to the Preferred Stock;

(f) whether the shares are entitled to the benefit of a sinking or
retirement fund to be applied to the purchase or redemption of shares of a
series and, if so entitled, the amount of the fund and the manner of its
application, including the price or prices at which the shares may be redeemed
or purchased through the application of the fund;

2
<PAGE> 3
(g) whether the shares are convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares
of any other class or classes or of any other series of the same or any other
class or classes of stock of the Corporation and, if so convertible or
exchangeable, the conversion price or prices, or the rates of exchange, and the
adjustments thereof, if any, at which the conversion or exchange may be made,
and any other terms and conditions of the conversion or exchange; and

(h) any other preferences, privileges and powers and relative
participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of a series, as the Board of Directors may deem
advisable and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate
of Incorporation.

3. Dividends.

Before any dividends on any class or classes of stock of the Corporation
ranking junior to the Preferred Stock may be declared or paid or set apart for
payment, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock of each series are entitled
to such cash dividends, but only when and as declared by the Board of
Directors out of funds legally available therefor, as they may be entitled to
in accordance with the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors providing for the issue of the series, payable on such dates in each
year as may be fixed in the resolution or resolutions. The term "class or
classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock"
means the Common Stock and any other class or classes of stock of the
Corporation hereafter authorized which rank junior to the Preferred Stock as to
dividends or upon liquidation.

4. Reacquired Shares.

Shares of Preferred Stock which have been issued and reacquired in any
manner by the Corporation (excluding, until the Corporation elects to retire
them, shares which are held as treasury shares but including shares redeemed,
shares purchased and retired and shares which have been converted into shares
of Common Stock) will have the status of authorized and unissued shares of
Preferred Stock and may be reissued.

5. Voting Rights.

Unless and except to the extent otherwise required by law or provided in
the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors creating any series of
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Division I, the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall have no voting power with respect to any matter whatsoever. In no event
shall the Preferred Stock be entitled to more than one vote in respect of each
share of stock except as may be required by law or by this Certificate of
Incorporation.

II. Common Stock

1. Dividends.

Subject to the preferential rights of the Preferred Stock, the holders of
the Common Stock are entitled to receive, to the extent permitted by law, such
dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.

2. Liquidation.

In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution,
distribution of assets or winding up of the Corporation, after distribution in
full of the preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock, holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
all of the remaining assets of the Corporation of whatever kind available for
distribution to stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares of
Common Stock held by them respectively. The Board of Directors may distribute
in kind to the holders of Common Stock such remaining assets of the Corporation
or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such remaining
assets to any other Corporation, trust or other entity and receive payment
therefor in cash, stock or obligations of such other Corporation, trust or
other entity, or any combination

3
<PAGE> 4
thereof, and may sell all or any part of the consideration so received and
distribute any balance thereof in kind to holders of Common Stock. The merger
or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation, or the
merger of any other corporation into it, or any purchase or redemption of
shares of stock of the Corporation of any class, shall not be deemed to be a
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation for the purpose of
this paragraph.

3. Voting Rights.

Except as may be otherwise required by law or this Certificate of
Incorporation, each holder of Common Stock has one vote in respect of each
share of stock held by him of record on the books of the Corporation on all
matters voted upon by the stockholders. The shareholder shall not have
cumulative voting rights.

III. Stock Rights and Options

The Board of Directors, in their discretion and without the approval of
the shareholders, may from time to time create and issue, rights or options
entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock of any class or
classes from the Corporation subject to the limitations set forth below. Such
rights or options are to be evidenced by or in such instrument or instruments
as shall be approved by the Board of Directors.

The Directors shall approve the terms upon which, including the time
(which may be limited or unlimited in duration) within which, and the price at
which any such shares may be purchased from the Corporation upon the exercise
of any such right or option. In no event shall the total rights or options
effect more than 50% of the authorized shares, nor can they be at prices less
than 10% of the sales or bid price averaged over the 30 day period immediately
prior to the sale. Rights or options may be granted at such less favorable
terms as shall be stated in a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors
providing for the creation and issuance of such rights or options. In the
absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the judgement of the Board of
Directors as the consideration for the issuance of such rights or options and
the sufficiency thereof shall be conclusive.

In case the shares of stock of the Corporation to be issued upon the
exercise of such rights or options shall be shares having a par value, the
price to be received therefor shall not be less than the par value thereof. In
case the shares of stock to be issued shall be shares of stock without par
value, the consideration therefor shall be determined in the manner provided in
Section 153 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

IV. Other Provisions

1. Preemptive Rights.

No stockholder of either preferred or common shares shall have any
preemptive right to subscribe to an additional issue of stock of any class or
series or to any stock rights, options, warrants, debentures or other
securities of the Corporation convertible into such stock.

2. Changes in Authorized Capital Stock.

Subject to the protective conditions and restriction of any outstanding
Preferred Stock, any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation which
increases or decreases the authorized capital stock of any class or classes may
be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the voting stock of the Corporation.

Certain Contracts

No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its
Directors or officers, or between the Corporation and any other Corporation,
partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its
Directors or officers are Directors or officers, or have a financial interest,
shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the
director or officer is present at or participates in a meeting of the Board or
committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely

some of the business conducted by the Corporation and its subsidiaries involve
the officers and others including subsidiaries and affiliates serving as

or action is permitted if:

transaction are disclosed or are known to stockholders entitled to vote
thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in a good
faith by vote of the stockholders; or

3. The contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the
time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board of Directors, a
committee thereof, or the stockholders. Interested Directors may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or
of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.

was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or

4. The indemnification provided hereby shall not be deemed exclusive
of all rights to which any person may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action
in any person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, and shall continue to any person as a person who has
ceased to be a Director, officer or agent as to claims arising during or as a
result of the service to the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the
person's heirs, executors and administrators.

5. The Corporation may, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
each Director and officer while serving as a Director or officer of the
Corporation or while serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against any person and
incurred by any person in any such capacity, or arising out of the status as
such.

<PAGE> 8

6. References to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents so that any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or who is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or
officer, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as the person would have with respect to such constituent
corporation as if its separate existence had continued.

7. References to "fines" shall include any excise taxes and penalties
assessed to any person with respect to any function; and references to "serving
at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director or
officer of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by the
person. This indemnity shall cover each person for all responsibilities for
the Corporation as a Director or officer or as a representative including
periods on or prior to the effective date of this Agreement.

The above right of indemnity shall extend to a person whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify the person against such
liability under Delaware Corporation law and may not be altered, amended, or
rescinded except by Court order or the advance written consent of the person.

Under the Communications Act of 1934 Section 310(b)(1-4) (the "Communications
Act"), a broadcast license may not be granted to, or held by, any corporation
that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other corporation that has
an alien as an officer, more than one-fourth of whose directors are aliens, or
more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or
their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by
non-U.S. corporations, if the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC")
finds that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of
such license. The Company has been advised that FCC staff has interpreted this
provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest
finding before a broadcast license may be granted to, or held by, any such
corporation, and that the FCC has made such an affirmative finding only in
limited circumstances. The Company controls corporations who either own or who
will own a broadcast license; therefore, THE FOLLOWING MUST BE EXECUTED BY THE
ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE BEFORE TRANSFER MAY BE MADE ON THE BOOKS OF THE
COMPANY:

The undersigned hereby certifies that the assignee of the stock referred to in
the foregoing Assignment.

_____ is an Alien (as defined below) or _____ is not an Alien

and that if any other person can direct or condition the disposition or
transfer of the stock hereof or if such stock is held for the account of any
other person, to the best of the undersigned's knowledge, such other person:

_____ is an Alien (as defined below), _____ is not an Alien, or _____
not applicable

Alien is defined hereinabove as (i) a person who is a citizen of a country
other than the United States; (ii) any entity organized under the laws of a
government other than the government of the United States or any state,
territory, or possession of the United States; (iii) a government other than
the government of the Untied States or of any state, territory, or possession
of the United States; or (iv) a representative of, or an individual or entity
controlled by, any of the foregoing.

Under the Communications Act of 1934 Section 310(b)(1-4) (the "Communications
Act"), a broadcast license may not be granted to, or held by, any corporation
that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other corporation that has
an alien as an officer, more than one-fourth of whose directors are aliens, or
more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or
their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by
non-U.S. corporations, if the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC")
finds that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of
such license. The Company has been advised that FCC staff has interpreted this
provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest
finding before a broadcast license may be granted to, or held by, any such
corporation, and that the FCC has made such an affirmative finding only in
limited circumstances. The Company controls corporations who either own or who
will own a broadcast license; therefore, THE FOLLOWING MUST BE EXECUTED BY THE
ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE BEFORE TRANSFER MAY BE MADE ON THE BOOKS OF THE
COMPANY:

The undersigned hereby certifies that the assignee of the stock referred to in
the foregoing Assignment.

_____ is an Alien (as defined below) or _____ is not an Alien

and that if any other person can direct or condition the disposition or
transfer of the stock hereof or if such stock is held for the account of any
other person, to the best of the undersigned's knowledge, such other person:

_____ is an Alien (as defined below), _____ is not an Alien, or _____
not applicable

Alien is defined hereinabove as (i) a person who is a citizen of a country
other than the United States; (ii) any entity organized under the laws of a
government other than the government of the United States or any state,
territory, or possession of the United States; (iii) a government other than
the government of the Untied States or of any state, territory, or possession
of the United States; or (iv) a representative of, or an individual or entity
controlled by, any of the foregoing.
