For Immediate Release
Tuesday, January 18, 1994

New York, January 18 -- Chemical Banking Corporation today
reported net income for the full year 1993 of $1.604 billion, an
increase of 48 percent from $1.086 billion for all of 1992. Net
income per common share for 1993 was $5.77, compared with $3.90 in
1992.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $347 million, or
$1.23 per common share, versus $197 million, or $.64 per share, on a
comparable fully-taxed basis and $304 million, or $1.09 per share,
on a reported basis (including tax benefits) in the fourth quarter
of 1992.

"Higher earnings for both the quarter and the year reflected
strong revenue growth in our core businesses," said Walter V.
Shipley, chairman and chief executive officer. "The corporation
continued to benefit from positions of market leadership, with
strong performances from capital markets, corporate finance,
regional banking and national consumer activities. In addition, the
fourth quarter included significant revenues related to developing
markets restructurings, partially offset by investments in several
of the corporation's key businesses."

"Nonperforming assets declined by $607 million during the
fourth quarter and by $2.6 billion, or 42 percent, during the past
year," said Mr. Shipley. "This continued improvement in credit
quality confirms our expectations for significantly lower provisions
in the years ahead."

At December 31, total nonperforming assets were $3,525 million,
down from $6,092 million on the same date a year ago. Nonperforming
assets were 2.4 percent of total assets at the end of the fourth
quarter, compared with 4.4 percent a year ago. The non-LDC
allowance for losses at December 31 was 123 percent of non-LDC 
nonperforming loans, compared with 64 percent a year ago.

The corporation's estimated Tier I risk-based capital ratio was
8.0 percent at December 31, compared with 7.3 percent a year ago. 
At December 31, the estimated total risk-based capital ratio was
12.1 percent, up from 11.6 percent on the same date a year ago.

<PAGE>6

During 1993, the corporation increased the quarterly dividend
on its common stock by 27 percent to 38 cents per share. In March,
the quarterly dividend was increased to 33 cents per share, from 30
cents per share, and in December to 38 cents per share.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $1,149 million,
compared with $1,226 million in the same year-ago period. For the
full year, net interest income was $4,636 million, compared with
$4,598 million a year ago.

The net yield on interest-earning assets was 3.65 percent in
the fourth quarter, compared with 4.01 percent in the fourth quarter
of 1992. The net yield on interest earning assets for the full year
was 3.73 percent, compared with 3.82 percent for all of 1992.

Net interest income in the fourth quarter of both 1993 and 1992
included one-time cash payments of approximately $30 million
received in connection with developing country debt restructurings.

Average interest-earning assets for the fourth quarter were
$125.7 billion, compared with $122.4 billion in the same year-ago
period. For the year, average interest-earning assets were $124.9
billion, compared with $121.2 billion for 1992.

NONINTEREST REVENUE

Noninterest revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,053 million,
an increase of 47 percent from $717 million in the same period a
year ago. Noninterest revenue for the full year was $4,024 million,
up 33 percent from $3,026 million for all of 1992.

Combined revenues from all trading activities were $255 million
in the fourth quarter, up 11 percent from $229 million in the same
year-ago period. For the year, total trading revenues were a record
$1,073 million, up 26 percent from $853 million in 1992. The
results reflected the corporation's emphasis on market making and
client-driven businesses.

Corporate finance and syndication fees were $88 million in the
quarter, up 49 percent from $59 million a year ago. Such fees for
the full year 1993 were $338 million, up 28 percent from $265
million a year ago. The increase underscored the corporation's
leadership position in global loan origination and distribution as
well as growth in corporate advisory activities.

Trust and investment management fees in the fourth quarter were
$109 million, up from $94 million in the 1992 fourth quarter, and
$406 million for the full year, up from $361 million in all of 1992. 
The improvement in the results primarily reflected growth in
Chemical's personal trust and asset management businesses.

<PAGE>7

Other noninterest revenue in the fourth quarter was $236
million, compared with $9 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
For the full year, other noninterest revenue was $710 million, up
from $190 million in all of 1992. The 1993 fourth quarter results
included one-time net revenues of $139 million principally related
to restructured country debt, including the sale of a portion of the
past due interest bonds received from Argentina. The full year 1993
included $331 million from the sale of such bonds received from
Argentina and Brazil. Revenues from venture capital activities were
$90 million in the fourth quarter and $301 million for the full year
1993, versus $17 million and $100 million in the respective 1992
periods.

Securities gains were $16 million in the fourth quarter,
compared with securities losses of $2 million in the same year-ago
quarter. For the year, securities gains were $142 million, compared
with gains of $53 million in all of 1992.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was $1,335 million,
compared with $1,294 million in the same year-ago quarter. For the
full year, noninterest expense was $5,293 million, versus $4,930
million a year ago.

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter reflected
approximately $150 million in expense savings related to the
December 31, 1991 merger of Chemical Banking Corporation and
Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, up from $90 million in the fourth
quarter a year ago. Merger-related expense savings for all of 1993
were $525 million, compared with $280 million for all of 1992.

Noninterest expense for both the fourth quarter and full year
1993 reflected higher expenses associated with investments in
certain of the corporation's key businesses, including an expansion
of Section 20 securities capabilities, the acquisitions by Texas
Commerce Bancshares of Ameritrust Texas Corporation and major
components of First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc., and $53
million in the fourth quarter related to the launch of a co-branded
MasterCard with Shell Oil Company.

Noninterest expense included foreclosed property expense of $61
million in the fourth quarter and $287 million for the year,
compared with $101 million and $283 million in the respective
periods of 1992. Noninterest expense for the full year 1993
included a third-quarter charge of $115 million ($67 million after-
tax) related to the completion of the corporation's assessment of
costs associated with the merger of Chemical and Manufacturers
Hanover. The fourth quarter of 1992 included a one-time charge of
$41 million related to costs incurred in combining the corporation's
employee benefits plans.

Excluding one-time charges, the ratio of noninterest expense to
total revenue improved to 60.6 percent in the fourth quarter, from
64.5 percent in the same year-ago quarter. On the same basis, this
ratio for the full year improved to 59.1 percent, from 63.7 percent
in 1992.

<PAGE>8

OTHER FINANCIAL DATA

Tax expense included income tax benefits totaling $331 million
for the full year 1993 and $278 million for all of 1992, including
$65 million in the 1992 fourth quarter. Because the corporation
recognized its remaining available Federal tax benefits in the third
quarter of 1993, the corporation's earnings beginning in the fourth
quarter of 1993 were reported on a fully-taxed basis.

On December 31, 1993, the corporation adopted SFAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
which addresses the accounting for investments in debt and equity
securities that have readily determinable fair values. SFAS 115
requires that investments and certain loan assets must be identified
as held to maturity, held for current resale or available for sale. 
Investments that are identified as available for sale are required
to be accounted for at their fair value with the related unrealized
gains and losses included as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. The adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a net
favorable impact of approximately $215 million after-tax to the
corporation's stockholders' equity.

<PAGE>11

The return on average common stockholders' equity (ROE) was
13.38 percent for the fourth quarter, versus 7.98 percent on a
comparable fully-taxed basis and 13.36 percent on a reported basis
in the year-ago fourth quarter. The ROE for the full year was 16.66
percent, compared with 12.36 percent for all of 1992.

The return on average total assets (ROA) was .94 percent for
the fourth quarter, versus .56 percent on a comparable fully-taxed
basis and .86 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter of
1992. The ROA for the full year was 1.11 percent, compared with .78
percent for all of 1992.

Total assets at December 31 were $149.9 billion, versus $139.7
billion on the same date a year ago. Total loans at the end of 1993
were $75.4 billion, compared with $82.0 billion a year ago. On
December 31, total deposits were $98.3 billion, compared with $94.2
billion at the end of 1992.

Book value per common share was $37.60 at December 31, versus
$32.43 per share on the same date a year ago.

TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES

Texas Commerce Bancshares (TCB) reported net income of $39
million in the fourth quarter and $169 million for the year, versus
$46 million and $180 million in the similar year-ago periods. 
Excluding the one-time restructuring charge of $43 million ($30
million after-tax) related to the First City acquisition and net
benefits of $9 million resulting from the adoption of two accounting
changes, earnings for the full year 1993 would have been $190
million. On a pre-tax basis, TCB's earnings were $64 million in the
fourth quarter and $226 million for the year, versus $47 million and
$184 million in the same periods of 1992.
