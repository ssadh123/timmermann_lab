AGREEMENT

At the present time the parties to this Agreement are the owners of more
than fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding Class B shares of
International Dairy Queen, Inc. (herein referred to as "Dairy Queen"). The
beneficial interest of all of such shares is either owned by Rudy Luther and his
issue or John W. and Jane N. Mooty and their issue. For convenience, the family
groups will be referred to below as "Rudy's Family" and as "John and Jane's
Family".
It is the desire of the two families that they enter into this Agreement in
order to ensure that no share of Class B common stock of Dairy Queen will be
sold, caused to be redeemed or otherwise transferred except in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual
covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:
1. None of the undersigned parties who are members of John and Jane's
Family will sell, cause to be redeemed or otherwise transfer any share of Class
B common stock of Dairy Queen except to a member of John and Jane's Family who
is a party to this Agreement or who subsequently agrees to be bound by the terms
of this Agreement unless such shares shall be first offered to Rudy's Family as
provided herein.

2. None of the undersigned parties who are members of Rudy's Family will
sell, cause to be redeemed or otherwise transfer any share of Class B common
stock of Dairy Queen except to a member of Rudy's Family who is a party to this
Agreement or who subsequently agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement
unless such shares shall be first offered to John and Jane's Family as provided
herein.
3. The Family to which the shares are offered under paragraph 1 or 2
hereof shall have the option to either (1) exchange one share of Class A common
for the share of Class B common being offered or (2) to pay for the Class B
share being offered a cash price equal to the mean between the bid and the asked
price for the Class B shares on the day on which the shares are offered as
reported in the Wall Street Journal on the following day.
4. When any party decides he or she desires to sell, cause to be redeemed
or transfer a share of Class B common stock of Dairy Queen to other than a
qualified member of the same Family, the person desiring to sell, cause to be
redeemed or transfer shall by written notice notify the Designated Person in the
other Family of such desire and the Designated Person receiving the notice shall
within five (5) days of the receipt of the notice, advise the notifying party in
writing that the Family of the designee either (a) desires to acquire all of the

shares sought to be transferred by an exchange for Class A shares of Dairy
Queen; or (b) desires to acquire all of the shares by cash payment; or (c)
desires to acquire part of the shares by a combination of the exchange for Class
A shares and cash; or (d) has no desire to purchase or exchange for the shares
proposed to be transferred.
In the event that no written response is furnished to the party offering to
transfer shares within the five (5) day period, it will be deemed that the
Family receiving the notice has no desire to acquire the shares.
In the event that option (a), (b), or (c) above is exercised, the
exercising party shall tender any Class A shares to be tendered or any cash to
be paid within ten (10) days of the exercise of such option.
5. The parties to this Agreement recognize that at certain times the
Class A shares have sold for a price that is greater than the price at which the
Class B shares were then trading and that at times the Class B shares have sold
for a price that is greater than the price at which the Class A shares were
trading but it is the desire of the parties that in the event shares of Class A
are exchanged for Class B pursuant to the terms of this Agreemnt that any
differential will be disregarded and the shares will be exchanged on a
one-for-one basis.
