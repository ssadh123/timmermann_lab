WESTMORELAND COAL COMPANY
TERMINATES PROPOSED SALE OF
WESTMORELAND ENERGY, INC. AND WILL
KEEP COMPANY
----------------------------------------------

Philadelphia, PA -- August 25, 1994 -- Westmoreland Coal Company (NYSE:WCX)
today announced that negotiations had terminated with a purchaser group
represented by LCRW Power Company, L.P. for the sale of the assets of
Westmoreland Energy, Inc. Westmoreland and LCRW had entered into an agreement
in principle on April 18, 1994 calling for negotiation of a definitive agreement
for the sale of the assets of Westmoreland Energy to the purchaser group for a
cash purchase price in excess of $50 Million, assumption of equity obligations,
and other consideration.

According to Christopher K. Seglem, President and Chief Executive Officer
of Westmoreland, "Because of the early stage of Westmoreland Energy's projects
and other developments it has not been possible to establish the value of
Westmoreland Energy and other terms and conditions of sale with the certainty we
deem necessary and prudent at this time for such a valuable and important asset.
Thus, we are no longer offering Westmoreland Energy for sale. We will reclassify
it as a continuing operation and expect it will make a significant and growing
contribution to our operating earnings."

On July 28, 1994, Westmoreland announced that a definitive agreement of
sale had been reached to sell its Kentucky Criterion Coal Company assets to
CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc. for a cash purchase price of $85 million. Proceeds
from that sale will be used to repay approximately $45 million of Westmoreland
credit obligations and to meet equity contribution obligations through 1995 of
approximately $28 million for current Westmoreland Energy projects.
