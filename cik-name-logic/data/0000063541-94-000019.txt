NEWTON, IOWA--(November 11, 1994)--Maytag Corporation has announced it will

invest approximately $160 million over the next three years at its refrigerator

production facility in Galesburg, Ill.

The capital improvement project will involve the complete redesign of 

the corporation's line of refrigerators and new manufacturing equipment and 

processes. Various changes will also be made in order to meet 1998 Department

of Energy refrigerator standards and the upcoming ban on chlorofluorocarbons 

CFCs).

Commenting on the project, Maytag's Chairman and CEO Leonard A. Hadley 

said, "I am very excited about this opportunity to design new refrigerator 

models that will be even more appealing to consumers and advance our 

competitive position in the marketplace. Additionally, this project will 

permit us to further enhance the quality of our refrigerators, provide 

increased production and give us improved manufacturing efficiency and 

responsiveness."

Today's announcement follows an agreement that was reached last week by 

Maytag and members of Local 2063 of the International Association of 

Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the Galesburg plant. The agreement is for an

extension of the current contract and provides for improvements in cost and

productivity as well as continuous workforce support of the project through 

implementation.

"The support we are receiving from the Maytag employees in Galesburg is

an indication of the commitment and dedication to this project that has been

shown by our Galesburg team. In addition, the support of the city of 

Galesburg and the state of Illinois is a first, but very important step, in 

the successful development, production and distribution of our next generation

of state-of-the-art, energy- efficient refrigerators," Hadley concluded.

Maytag Corporation is a leading appliance enterprise focused on five 

principal areas of home management: laundry, cooking, dishwashing, 

refrigeration and floor care. Vending equipment is an additional corporate 

business. The corporation's appliance brands include Maytag, Hoover, Jenn-

Air, Magic Chef and Admiral. Dixie-Narco is the vending equipment 

manufacturer. 

Headquartered in Newton, Iowa, Maytag has 20 manufacturing operations in

six countries and approximately 21,000 employees worldwide.
