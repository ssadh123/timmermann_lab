Item 5. Other Events

This calculation is being filed in connection with the Company's Registration
Statement on Form S-3, File No. 33-55379, and the Company's proposed issuance
of $200.0 million of principal amount of Debentures due in 2024 (the 
"Debentures"). Pro forma ratios are after giving effect to the net increase in
interest expense due to the issuance of the Debentures at a maximum assumed 
rate of 9 1/4%, less the repayment of $200.0 million of short-term debt at a
weighted average interest rate of 4.82%. A decrease of 1/8 of 1% in the 
assumed interest rate for the Debentures increases the ratio described
in note 1 below by 0.04 for both the six months ended June 30, 1994 and the
year ended December 31, 1993, and there would be no change in the ratios
described in notes 2 and 3 below.
