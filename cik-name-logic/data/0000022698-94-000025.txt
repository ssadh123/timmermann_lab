Notes:
(1) In June 1994, the corporation consummated a merger with Radiation Systems, 
Inc. (RSi). The merger has been treated as a "pooling of interests" for 
accounting purposes. Accordingly, these financial statements have been 
retroactively restated for all periods to include RSi.

(2) Revenues include business interruption insurance income of $0.9 million, 
$1.3 million and $0.8 million in the first, second and third quarters 
of 1993, respectively, and $4.8 million in the second quarter of 1994.

(3) Income tax expense for the third quarter of 1993 includes a charge of 
$3.0 million ($0.06 per share) to adjust prior years' deferred tax 
assets and liabilities for an increase in the Federal income tax rate 
from 34% to 35%.
