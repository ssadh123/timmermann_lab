On October 14, 1994, Quaker State Corporation ("Quaker State") filed a

1994, Quaker State completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of
Westland Oil Company, Inc., the acquisition by cash merger of the Specialty
Oil Companies and the purchase of certain related equipment. Because it was
impracticable to provide the required financial statements for the acquired
businesses and pro forma financial information related to the transaction at the
time of filing, such financial statements and pro forma financial information
were not included with that report on Form 8-K. Quaker State hereby amends
Item 7, Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information, and Exhibits, 
of its report on Form 8-K filed on October 14, 1994, as set forth below.

September 30, 1994.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Specialty Oil
Company, Inc., I, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., II, Specialty Oil Company Inc.,
III, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., IV and Westland Oil Company, Inc. at
December 25, 1993 and December 26, 1992, and the related combined statements
of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companies'
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the combined financial position of Specialty Oil
Company, Inc., I, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., II, Specialty Oil Company,
Inc., III, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., IV and Westland Oil Company, Inc. at
December 25, 1993 and December 26, 1992, and the combined results of their
operations and their combined cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Note 14 is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required
part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 25, 1993 AND DECEMBER 26, 1992

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS.

The companies are engaged in the packaging and distribution of motor oil
and related products, primarily private label lubricants. The companies
have locations in Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and New
Mexico. The companies also have an environmental division, Specialty
Environmental Services (SES). SES collects, transport, test and recycles
used products: lubricants, antifreeze, brake fluid, and used motor oil
filters. None of the products are considered hazardous materials.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. 

PRINCIPLES OF COMBINATION 

The combined financial statements include the accounts of Specialty Oil
Company, Inc., I, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., II, Specialty Oil Company,
Inc., III (refer to Note 15), Specialty Oil Company, Inc., IV (refer to
Note 17) and Westland Oil Company, Inc. (previously Westland Capital
Corporation). The financial statements of the companies are combined due
to the controlling ownership of the companies by two individuals and the
related operations of the companies. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.

FISCAL YEAR

The companies' fiscal year is a 52 week year ending on the Saturday of the
52nd week.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS 

The companies follow the method of providing allowances for doubtful
receivables based upon historical collection experience.

INVENTORY

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market on the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method.

GOODWILL 

Goodwill is being amortized over a forty year period. The goodwill is the
excess cost paid over book value of assets acquired from Westland Oil
Company, Inc. by Westland Oil Company, Inc. (previously Westland Capital
Corporation).

NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT 

The non-compete agreement is being amortized over five years. This
agreement was obtained in the purchase of Specialty Oil Company, Inc., III.
The unamortized balance at December 25, 1993 was $195,000.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. (Continued)

RECEIVABLES 

The companies sell products in the states described in Note 1 to a diverse
base of customers.

FIXED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION 

Fixed assets are carried at cost. Expenditures for replacements are
capitalized and the replaced items are retired. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred. Gains and losses from the sale of
fixed assets are included in income. Depreciation is calculated on the
straight-line basis utilizing the following estimated useful lives:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings 32 years
Leasehold improvements 5 to 15 years
Machinery and equipment 5 to 10 years
Trucks and trailers 4 to 6 years
Automobiles 3 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years
</TABLE>

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES 

The companies elected taxation under the IRC Subchapter S effective for the
tax year 1987; thus, the companies pay no federal or state income taxes.
The income is taxed at the individual shareholder level for federal and
state income tax purposes.

CASH EQUIVALENTS 

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the companies consider all debt
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents, except restricted cash.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Specialty Oil
Company, Inc., I, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., II, Specialty Oil Company Inc.,
III, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., IV and Westland Oil Company, Inc. at
December 26, 1992 and December 28, 1991, and the related combined statements
of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companies'
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the combined financial position of Specialty Oil
Company, Inc., I, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., II, Specialty Oil Company,
Inc., III, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., IV and Westland Oil Company, Inc. at
December 26, 1992 and December 28, 1991, and the combined results of their
operations and their combined cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Note 15 is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required
part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.

PRINCIPLES OF COMBINATION
The combined financial statements include the accounts of Specialty Oil
Company, Inc., I, Specialty Oil Company, Inc., II, Specialty Oil Company,
Inc., III (refer to Note 16), Specialty Oil Company, Inc., IV (refer to
Note 17) and Westland Oil Company, Inc. (previously Westland Capital
Corporation). The financial statements of the companies are combined due
to the controlling ownership of the companies by two individuals and the
related operations of the companies. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.

Westland Capital Corporation merged with its wholly owned subsidiary,
Westland Oil Company, effective for 1987. Westland Capital Corporation
then changed its name to Westland Oil Company, Inc. The merger was at
Westland's cost with the excess cost over book value being recognized as
goodwill.

FISCAL YEAR
The companies' fiscal year is a 52 week year ending on the Saturday of the
52nd week.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS 
The companies follow the method of providing allowances for doubtful
receivables based upon historical collection experience.

INVENTORY 
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market on the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method.

GOODWILL
Goodwill is being amortized over a forty year period. The goodwill is the
excess cost paid over book value of assets acquired from Westland Oil
Company, Inc. by Westland Oil Company, Inc. (previously Westland Capital
Corporation).

NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT 
The non-compete agreement is being amortized over five years. This
agreement was obtained in the purchase of Specialty Oil Company, Inc., III.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. (Continued)

RECEIVABLES 
The companies sell products in the states described in Note 1 to a diverse
base of customers.

FIXED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION
Fixed assets are carried at cost. Expenditures for replacements are
capitalized and the replaced items are retired. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred. Gains and losses from the sale of
fixed assets are included in income. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis utilizing the following estimated useful lives:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings 32 years
Leasehold improvements 5 to 15 years
Machinery and equipment 5 to 10 years
Trucks and trailers 4 to 6 years
Automobiles 3 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years
</TABLE>

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES 
The companies elected taxation under the IRC Subchapter S effective for the
tax year 1987; thus, the companies pay no federal or state income taxes.
The income is taxed at the individual shareholder level for federal and
state income tax purposes.

CASH EQUIVALENTS 
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the companies consider all debt
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents, except restricted cash.

Item 7(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

On September 30, 1994 Quaker State Corporation (Quaker State) acquired all
the stock of Westland Company, Inc. (Westland) and the Specialty Oil Companies
(Specialty). The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method
and, accordingly, the operating results of Westland and Specialty will be
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
The purchase accounting adjustments presented in the following pro forma
statements are preliminary estimates and subsequent revisions may be necessary.
The following pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the historical financial statements and other financial information of Westland
and Specialty appearing elsewhere in Quaker State's Form 8-K/A-1 and the
historical financial statements and other financial information of Quaker State
appearing in its 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its quarterly report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1994. In addition, the
disposition of Quaker State's wholly owned subsidiary, Heritage Insurance
Group, Inc., sold on August 31, 1994 is reported in the September 15, 1994 8-K
filing by Quaker State Corporation.

PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

No Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet of Quaker State Corporation and
Subsidiaries for the nine-month period ending September 30, 1994 is included in
this current report on Form 8-K because the purchase of Westland and Specialty
is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Quaker State Corporation's
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1994.

PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

The following unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations of 
Quaker State Corporation for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the nine
months ended September 30, 1994 present the separate historical results of
Quaker State and Westland/Specialty (prior to the acquisition date of September
30, 1994) and consolidated pro forma results as though such purchases had
occurred on January 1, 1993. The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements 
of Operations do not purport to be indicative of the results which actually 
would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 1993 
or which may occur in the future.
