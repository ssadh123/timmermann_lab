ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On November 7, 1994, Astec Industries, Inc. (Astec) acquired the remaining
50% ownership interest in Wibau-Astec Maschinenfabrik GmbH of Grandau,
Germany (Wibau-Astec) from Putzmeister-Werk Maschinenfabrik GmbH of
Stuttgart, Germany (Putzmeister) in a stock purchase transaction. As a 
result of the transaction, Astec now owns 100% of the outstanding stock of
Wibau-Astec. Astec had previously acquired a 50% ownership interest in
Wibau-Astec from Putzmeister in July, 1993. Astec paid 
cash of approximately $67,000 or 100,000 DM (Deutche Marks) for the remaining
50% of the Wibau-Astec stock and guaranteed Wibau-Astec debt of approximately
$3,500,000 or 5,800,000 DM.

The assets of the Wibau-Astec business consist primarily of inventories,
receivables,manufacturing machinery and equipment, computer equipment and
software and office equipment used in manufacturing asphalt plants, their
components and parts. The registrant intends to use the Wibau-Astec 
assets to produce mainly replacement parts.

The purchase price was determined as a result of arm's-length negotiations
between Astec and Putzmeister. Astec used working capital to effect this
