ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On November 21, 1994, ECO Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("ECO") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana
corporation ("Lilly") pursuant to its Offer to Purchase, dated July 15, 1994
(the "Offer"), purchased 42,640,622 shares of the common stock, par value $2.00
per share (the "Shares"), of McKesson Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("McKesson") for $76.00 net per Share. The Shares so purchased represented
approximately 94.9% of the Shares outstanding on such date. Of such Shares,
2,933,458 Shares (approximately 6.5% of the Shares outstanding) were tendered
pursuant to notices of guaranteed delivery. The amount and nature of the
consideration was the result of arms-length negotiation between Lilly and
McKesson.

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 10, 1994, as
amended, by and among ECO, Lilly and McKesson (the "Merger Agreement"), Lilly
intends to effect a merger of ECO with and into McKesson (the "Merger")
pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law as soon as
practicable. Upon the consummation of the Merger, each outstanding Share (other
than Shares acquired by ECO in the Offer, Shares owned by a subsidiary of
McKesson and Shares as to which appraisal rights are perfected) will be
converted into the right to receive $76.00 in cash. Prior to the expiration of
the Offer, McKesson completed a spin-off to its stockholders of record on
November 19 of the common stock of a newly created corporation that held all of
McKesson's businesses and subsidiaries other than its pharmaceutical benefits
management business (the "PCS Group"). Accordingly, upon consummation of the
Offer and the Merger, McKesson, then consisting solely of the PCS Group, will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lilly.

Lilly funded the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the payment
of approximately $630 million to McKesson (as required by the Merger
Agreement), and expects to fund the Merger and all transaction-related fees and
expenses (all of which are expected to total approximately $4.1 billion), with
the proceeds of a $4.0 billion commercial paper program and internally
generated funds.

NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed combined financial statements include PCS Health
Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("PCS"), Clinical Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and
its subsidiary ("CPI") and an equity interest in Integrated Medical Systems
("IMS"), collectively defined as the "PCS Group" or the "Company". McKesson
Corporation ("McKesson") at September 30, 1994 owned 100% of the outstanding
common stock of PCS and CPI and the equity interest in IMS. On July 10, 1994,
McKesson entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") to sell the
PCS Group, see Note 3. The accompanying condensed combined financial statements
have been prepared in connection with this Agreement.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

2. Interim Financial Statements

In the opinion of the Company, these unaudited condensed combined financial
statements include all adjustments necessary to a fair presentation of the
Company's financial position as of September 30, 1994 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the six months then ended. Such adjustments
were of a normal recurring nature.

The results of operations for the six months ended September 30, 1994 and
1993 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.

It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements, accounting policies and financial notes thereto
included in the Company's March 31, 1994 annual financial statements.

3. Proposed Sale of the PCS Group

On July 10, 1994, McKesson entered into an Agreement providing for the
acquisition by Eli Lilly and Company ("Lilly") of the PCS Group. On November
21, 1994, a Lilly subsidiary acquired through a tender offer approximately 95%
of McKesson after the distribution by McKesson of all its businesses other than
the PCS Group.

4. Contingencies

The Company has entered into capitation contracts with certain customers in
the ordinary course of business. These contracts provide that the Company
assume varying percentages of the risk associated with claims experience
differing from fixed fee arrangements under managed care programs. During the
six months ended September 30, 1994, the Company recorded loss provisions
totalling $6,400,000 related to these contracts.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Stockholder of PCS Group:

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of PCS Group
(defined in Note 1 to the combined financial statements) as of March 31, 1994,
1993 and 1992, and the related combined statements of income, stockholder's
equity and cash flows for the years then ended. The companies defined in Note 1
to the combined financial statements are under common ownership and common
management. These financial statements are the responsibility of PCS Group's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the combined financial position of PCS Group at March 31, 1994, 1993
and 1992, and the combined results of their operations and their combined cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the combined financial statements, in 1992 PCS
Group changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation--The accompanying combined financial statements include
PCS Health Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("PCS"), Clinical
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiary ("CPI") and an equity interest in
Integrated Medical Systems ("IMS"), collectively defined as the "PCS Group" or
the "Company". CPI and IMS have been included in the accompanying financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition (see Note 2). McKesson
Corporation ("McKesson") at March 31, 1994 owned 100% of the outstanding common
stock of PCS and CPI and the equity interest in IMS. On July 10, 1994, McKesson
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") to sell the PCS
Group, see Proposed Sale of the Company below. The accompanying combined
financial statements have been prepared in connection with this Agreement.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Business--The Company provides computer-based prescription drug claims
processing and pharmacy benefit design, administration and management services
to health plan sponsors, including, insurance companies, third party
administrators, self-insured employers, and health maintenance and Blue
Cross/Blue Shield organizations that underwrite or administer prescription
benefit plans. The Company helps these customers manage the cost of
prescription plans by providing drug utilization reviews, clinically-based
formularies and generic substitution programs. The Company also operates an on-
line electronic network to transmit medical, hospital, laboratory, clinical and
billing information that links health care providers (physicians, hospitals and
clinics) with health plan sponsors. RECAP (TM), the Company's on-line
prescription claims management system, is linked with over 95% of retail
pharmacies in the U.S.

Transactions with McKesson Corporation--Certain expenses, principally
employee benefits, are paid on behalf of, and charged to the Company by
McKesson. In addition, the Company uses certain resources and administrative
staff of McKesson, including financial, legal, tax, internal audit, accounting
advice, and certain personnel and financial systems data processing and
employee benefit services. The Company is charged a fee for these and other
services and general liability and workers' compensation insurance premiums at
an amount based on actual time or costs incurred. The Company paid McKesson
$1,294,000, $946,000 and $979,000 in fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, for the services; and, $400,000, $75,000 and $115,000 in fiscal
years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, for the insurance premiums.

The Company participated in McKesson's cash management program as described
in Note 5 and also participates in certain McKesson employee benefit plans, as
described in Note 6.

The accompanying financial statements reflect a distribution, retroactive to
fiscal 1991, of a dividend (reflected as a reduction to the March 31, 1991 PCS
retained earnings balance) to McKesson totalling $93,567,000.

Proposed Sale of the Company--On July 10, 1994, McKesson entered into an
Agreement providing for the acquisition by a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and
Company ("Lilly") of the PCS Group. This transaction is subject to various
conditions including provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

Income Taxes--The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability
method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".

Cash and Short-Term Investments include all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less.

PCS GROUP

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)

Property is stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of three to ten years. The buildings are depreciated
over their estimated useful life of 35 years (see Note 4).

Goodwill is amortized over 3 to 40 years and is stated net of accumulated
amortization of $7,532,000, $5,158,000 and $3,946,000 at March 31, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively (see Note 2).

Capitalized Software included in other assets reflects costs related to
internally developed or purchased software for projects in excess of $100,000
that are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not
exceeding five years.

Claim Reimbursements Receivable and Claims Payable are recorded when the
reimbursement request is received from a member pharmacy. Reimbursements for
claim payments are not included in revenues, and payments to member pharmacies
are not included in expenses. Checks outstanding are classified as liabilities
because they are drawn on zero balance accounts.

Revenues include claims processing fees that are accrued when the related
claim is processed and approved for payment. Other revenues are generally
recognized as the services are performed.

Changes in Accounting Principles--During 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No.
112, "Employer's Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". This accounting
change did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
statements. In 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". The cumulative effect of
adopting this new standard resulted in a charge to net income of $540,000 net
of a $360,000 tax benefit.

2. Acquisitions

In April 1993, McKesson purchased all the outstanding shares of CPI, an
administrator of clinically based managed prescription drug benefit programs.
The cost of the shares, which was paid in cash, was approximately $34,079,000
including transaction related costs. The acquisition, which has been accounted
for as a purchase, resulted in additional goodwill of $34,820,000 which is
being amortized over 25 years. The accompanying combined financial statements
include CPI from the date of acquisition.

In January 1994, McKesson purchased an approximate 15% interest in IMS, a
developer of community medical information systems. IMS's networks link
physicians with other health care providers, managed care organizations and
health plan sponsors. McKesson paid an aggregate cash purchase price of
$6,256,000 for 50,000 common shares and 1,250,000 convertible preferred shares
(convertible 1 to 1 into common) of outstanding IMS stock. Such investment is
accounted for under the cost method and is included in other assets. In
addition, McKesson placed a $4,000,000 deposit in escrow toward the purchase of
an additional 1,000,000 convertible preferred shares. On July 12, 1994,
McKesson used the $4,000,000 deposit to acquire the additional convertible
preferred shares, increasing the Company's ownership interest in IMS to
approximately 24%.

The impact on fiscal 1994 and 1993 revenues and net income, had the
acquisitions occurred at the beginning of fiscal 1993, is not material.

3. Taxes on Income

The Company is included in McKesson's consolidated federal income tax return.
The Company's tax provision has been computed as if the Company filed separate
income tax returns. The provision for income taxes is made up of the following
components:

5. Due to McKesson

The Company participated in McKesson's cash management program whereby the
Company's cash receipts were transferred daily to a McKesson bank account and
the Company's cash disbursements were funded by McKesson. The Company was
charged interest expense on funds advanced by McKesson and received interest
income on funds provided to McKesson, at McKesson's short-term borrowing rates.
At March 31, 1994, McKesson converted the excess of disbursements funded by
McKesson over cash receipts to a short-term credit line which is due on demand
and bears interest at McKesson's short-term borrowing rates. During the three
year period ended March 31, 1994, the amounts by which the Company's
disbursements that McKesson funded, net of the Company's cash receipts,
averaged $0 on a daily basis.

6. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company's employees are eligible to participate in a profit-sharing plan.
The Company's contributions to the plan were $949,000, $625,000 and $548,000 in
fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The Company's employees are also
eligible to participate in McKesson's health, retirement and certain other
employee benefit plans. The expense of these benefit plans was approximately
$5,720,000, $4,663,000 and $3,946,000 ($4,925,000, $3,995,000 and $3,442,000
for the health plan benefit) in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

7. Lease Commitments

The Company leases facilities and equipment under operating leases that
expire on various dates through September 2000. Rent expense was $4,051,000,
$2,127,000 and $1,912,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. As of
March 31, 1994, future minimum lease payments are as follows:

8. CONTINGENCIES

Subsequent to year end, the Company entered into capitation contracts with
certain customers in the ordinary course of business. These contracts provide
that the Company assume varying percentages of the risk associated with claims
experience differing from fixed fee arrangements under managed care programs.
During the three months ended June 30, 1994, the Company recorded loss
provisions totalling $3,700,000 related to these contracts.

The Company is subject to various claims, including claims related to certain
sales/use tax matters, and possible legal actions brought by plan sponsors for
alleged errors or omissions arising out of the ordinary course of business. The
Company has in place insurance to cover certain claims subject to a $1,000,000
deductible. Management believes that it has adequate reserves against potential
losses and that the outcome of such claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's combined financial position or results of operations.

9. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES

Income taxes totalling $16,806,000, $15,140,000 and $14,792,000 were paid,
primarily to McKesson in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Interest
totalling $18,000, $81,000 and $2,433,000 was paid in fiscal 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

10. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER

During 1994 one customer accounted for 17% of the Company's revenues.

11. EVENT (UNAUDITED) SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS'
REPORT

On November 21, 1994, a subsidiary of Lilly acquired through a tender offer
approximately 95% of McKesson after the distribution by McKesson of all of its
businesses other than the PCS Group.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet assumes that the
Merger was consummated on September 30, 1994, and the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Statements of Income assume the Merger was consummated on
January 1, 1993. The fiscal year of Eli Lilly and Company ends on December 31,
and the fiscal year of McKesson ends on March 31. For purposes of presenting
the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income for the year
ended December 31, 1993, the PCS Group results for the period from April 1,
1993 to March 31, 1994 were included. The Pro Forma Combined Condensed
Statement of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 includes the
period from January 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994 for both Lilly and the PCS
Group. Therefore, the PCS Group results for January 1, 1994 through March 31,
1994 were included in both statements.

ELI LILLY AND COMPANY

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENTS

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet was prepared to
reflect the Merger, which was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, as if the Merger occurred on September 30, 1994.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements of Income have been
prepared to reflect the Merger as if the Merger occurred January 1, 1993. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 40-year period.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet and Statements of
Income also include adjustments relating to an initial public offering for up
to 20% of the shares of Guidant Corporation ("Guidant"), a newly formed company
comprising five of Lilly's medical device and diagnostics (MDD) businesses.
This IPO is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of 1994 and is part of
Lilly's previously announced intent to divest itself of its MDD businesses.

Included in Lilly's historical Statement of Income for the year ended
December 31, 1993, is a pretax restructuring and special charge of $1,172.7
million. This charge represents provisions by Lilly to reduce its workforce
through early retirement programs, as well as initiate actions to consolidate
certain manufacturing operations around the world, implement revised product
distribution strategies and to streamline its core pharmaceutical operations.

Included in Lilly's historical Statement of Income for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994, is a pretax special charge of $66.0 million relating to the
March 31, 1994, voluntary recall of three of Lilly's liquid oral antibiotics as
well as a nonrecurring pretax charge of $58.4 million for acquired research
associated with Lilly's acquisition of Sphinx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in
September, 1994.

The following is a summary of reclassifications and adjustments reflected in
the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet and Statements of
Income:

(1) Represents the pro forma adjustments included in the Guidant S-1
filing, as amended, that affect the consolidated Eli Lilly and Company
financial statements. These adjustments reflect the projected
outstanding debt of Guidant as well as the increase in interest expense
associated with such debt and the projected receipts of the initial
public offering of $193.2 million. The assumed interest rate of the
long-term debt of 5.05% considers Lilly to be a guarantor of such debt.

(2) As documented in the Guidant S-1, as amended, it is assumed that Lilly
will beneficially own 82.3% of Guidant's outstanding common stock upon
completion of the IPO. This adjustment recognizes the minority interest
of 17.7%. The unaudited pro forma financial statements contained in the
Guidant S-1 filing, as amended, have been adjusted for the difference
in interest rates between Lilly's rate (see Note 1) and Guidant's
stand-alone rate used in the S-1, as well as interest income on
intercompany advances.

(3) Represents the elimination of intercompany receivables and payables
between PCS and Lilly at September 30, 1994 as well as intercompany
revenue and expense between PCS and Lilly.

(4) Represents the preliminary estimate of excess purchase price over the
book value of PCS net assets acquired (goodwill). The purchase price
has been adjusted to include acquisition-related expenses (see Note 6).
The amortization period reflected in the Statements of Income for such
goodwill is 40 years.

(5) Represents the issuance of short-term and long-term debt to finance the
cash acquisition. The Statements of Income reflect the increase in
interest expense based on issuance of short-term debt at an assumed
interest rate of 5.5% and long-term debt at an assumed interest rate of
8.25%. It is assumed that there are no significant debt issuance costs,
that all debt was issued on January 1, 1993 and was outstanding through
September 30, 1994 and that the short-term debt was refinanced in 1994
with the same interest rate assumptions.

20
<PAGE>

(6) Represents the amount of estimated acquisition fees for legal and
investment banker advisory services related to the Merger.

(7) Represents the elimination of PCS historical equity.

(8) Represents the tax effect of the Statements of Income adjustments,
excluding the goodwill amortization, based upon the statutory rate in
effect for the periods shown.
