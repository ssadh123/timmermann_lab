We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

NATURE OF BUSINESS:

The Company specializes in demand printing of corporate identity and
marketing program materials sold primarily to franchised organizations,
large corporations and associations.

The Company's fiscal year end is December 31.

CASH EQUIVALENTS:

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES:

Inventories, consisting primarily of paper and printed materials, are
stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a last-in,
first-out (LIFO) basis. At September 30, 1993, inventories, valued on the
LIFO method, approximated $185,000 less than the amount of such inventories
valued on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net income would have
been $17,800 less than reported for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 1993, had the FIFO method been used.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Significant additions or
improvements extending asset lives are capitalized; normal maintenance and
repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are
recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. When assets are sold or retired, related gains or losses are
included in the results of operations.

INCOME TAXES:

The Company's stockholders have elected to be taxed as an S Corporation
under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and comparable Minnesota
income tax law. Under those provisions, the Company's net income or loss
is reported on the individual tax returns of the Company's stockholders.
Therefore, no provision or liability for income taxes is reflected in the
Company's financial statements.

The Company makes monthly deposits to accounts, established with the bond
trustee, for the purpose of repaying principal and interest on industrial
development bonds outstanding (Note 4). The amount of the required monthly
deposits vary from year to year and are adjusted for interest earned on the
business loan reserve accounts, which were established from the proceeds of
the bond issues. The business loan reserve accounts are held in trust in
the event of default on the bond issues. It is expected that the business
loan reserve accounts will be used to make the final payments due on the
bonds.

4. FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS:

BANK FINANCING:

The Company has a financing arrangement with a bank in an amount not to
exceed $2 million that expires on May 31, 1994. This arrangement is
personally guaranteed by the Company's stockholders and is collateralized
by accounts receivable, inventories and a second lien on equipment. The
arrangement consists of the following:

- A $2 million revolving line of credit payable upon demand that bears
interest at the prime rate (6% at September 30, 1993). Borrowings on
the revolving line of credit are limited to $2 million less the
aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding letters of credit.
At September 30, 1993, no borrowings were outstanding.

- A $155,000 letter of credit agreement which bears a credit fee of 1%
per annum on the undrawn face amount. At September 30, 1993, no

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors
May Printing Company
St. Cloud, Minnesota

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of May Printing Company as of
December 31, 1992, and the related statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of May Printing
Company as of December 31, 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note L to the financial statements, the Company's Balance Sheet
has been reclassified to reflect the amounts due from related parties as a
reduction in stockholders' equity. This format has been presented to
facilitate a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in association
with the sale of the Company's assets and liabilities to a publicly held
company.
