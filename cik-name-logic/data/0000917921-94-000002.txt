ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

An action was commenced on November 22, 1993 against the
Company and Ronald G. Assaf, its Chairman of the Board, President
and Chief Executive Officer, in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida, by Bayer Silver, alleging
that favorable public statements by the Company concerning its
growth and the quality of its products were false. The suit arises
out of the controversy resulting from the Company's Ultra-Max 
product being named the recommended standard for electronic article
surveillance protection of pre-recorded music by the National
Association of Recording Merchandisers ("NARM"), and the rejection
of NARM's recommendations announced by the music manufacturers on
November 11, 1993. The suit alleges that the Company's statements
at various times since January 8, 1993, relating to the suitability
of its Ultra-Max system for the music recording industry, and
favorable to the Company's prospects for implementing and
benefiting from the source labelling program being promoted by
NARM, were false and misleading.

The plaintiff, who claims to be a stockholder of the
Company who purchased 400 shares of the Company's common stock
during the period in question, seeks class certification and
unspecified compensatory damages for himself and other putative
class members who purchased the Company's common stock in the
period from January 8, 1993 through November 11, 1993. The Company
believes in the appropriateness of its public statements with
respect to NARM and the suitability of the Company's Ultra-Max
system for the music industry and intends to vigorously defend
against the suit.
