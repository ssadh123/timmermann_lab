DRUG EMPORIUM TO DOWNSIZE
WASHINGTON, D.C. OPERATIONS

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 11, 1994--Drug Emporium, Inc. announced today
that it has entered into an agreement with CVS, a subsidiary of Melville
Corporation, to sell seven Drug Emporium stores located in the Washington, D.C.
market.
Drug Emporium also announced that it will close an additional 14
stores, leaving it with five stores in the Washington, D.C. market.
David L. Kriegel, Drug Emporium's chairman and chief executive 
officer, said, "We began in January 1993 executing a turnaround plan which is 
well under way, as evidenced by seven consecutive profitable quarters. The 
stores being sold or closed have not responded sufficiently to our turnaround
efforts and are preventing the company from demonstrating its earnings and
cash-flow potential. We intend to redeploy the capital from the Washington,
D.C. market to our better performing regions."
The 21 stores to be sold or closed had revenues of $46 million for the
six months ended August 27, 1994. These stores generated a pretax loss of $2.5
million during that same period. Total company sales for the six months ended
August 27, 1994 were $372.8 million and pretax profits were $822,000. Net
income for the same period was $497,000 or four cents per share.
Mr. Kriegel said the costs associated with the 21 stores will result
in an estimated charge of $11.8 million in the company's third quarter.
Operating results for the stores will be included in the company's financial
statements through the date the stores close. The sale and store closings are
expected to occur before February 28, 1995.
