TEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

(a) On May 12, 1994, the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation (the "Company")
reviewed proposals from two independent accounting firms to
provide audit services. The Audit Committee then selected Ernst
& Young to serve as the Company's new principal independent
accountants and discontinued its client-auditor relationship with
Coopers & Lybrand.

The Company did not contact Ernst & Young during the Company's
two most recent fiscal years, or any subsequent interim period
regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a
specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's
financial statements; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of
a disagreement. Prior to its engagement, Ernst & Young was
neither asked for, nor has it expressed any opinion on any
accounting issues concerning the Company.

(b) There were no disagreements with Coopers & Lybrand during
the fiscal years ended December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1993,
or any subsequent interim period, on any matters involving
accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(c) The reports of Coopers & Lybrand for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1993, or any subsequent
interim period did not contain an adverse opinion, disclaimer of
opinion, qualification, or modification as to uncertainty, audit
scope or accounting principles.

(d) Coopers & Lybrand has furnished to the Company a letter,
dated May 13, 1994 addressed to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as required by Item 304 of Regulation 8-K,
stating that it agrees with the statements made by the registrant
herein. A copy of the letter is being filed as Exhibit 16 to
this Form 8-K.
