Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
First Federal Savings and Loan Association
of Charlotte and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Charlotte and subsidiaries, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Fairfield Communities, Inc., as of December 31, 1993 and
1992 (reorganized company), and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for the year ended December
31, 1993 (reorganized company) and the six month periods ended December 31,
1992 (reorganized company) and June 30, 1992 (prior to parent company
reorganization) and for the year ended December 31, 1991 (prior to parent
company reorganization). These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Association's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Charlotte and
subsidiaries at December 31, 1993, and 1992 (reorganized company), and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 1993 (reorganized company) and the six month periods
ended December 31, 1992 (reorganized company) and June 30, 1992 (prior to
parent company reorganization) and for the year ended December 31, 1991
(prior to parent company reorganization) in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Charlotte and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1993

1. Principles of Consolidation and Reorganization

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Federal
Savings and Loan Association of Charlotte (the Association) and its wholly-
owned subsidiaries. The Association provides banking services to customers
who are primarily located in Richmond, Montgomery, Mecklenburg, and
contiguous counties in the state of North Carolina. The Company is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Fairfield Communities, Inc. (Fairfield). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

In 1990, Fairfield and twelve wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary
petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. Several other subsidiaries of Fairfield were not part of
the Chapter 11 filings, including the Association. On August 14, 1992, the
Bankruptcy Court confirmed the reorganization plans (the "Plans").

Fairfield has implemented, as of June 30, 1992, the recommended accounting
for entities emerging from reorganization set forth in Statement of Position
90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the
Bankruptcy Code" ("SOP 90-7") issued by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants ("Fresh Start Reporting"). Accordingly, assets and
liabilities of Fairfield and the Association were adjusted to reflect their
estimated fair values and the accumulated retained deficit was eliminated.

The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993
and the six months ended December 31, 1992 and the consolidated statements
of stockholder's equity and cash flows for the same periods have been
prepared as if the Association is a new reporting entity. Therefore, a
black line has been shown to separate these periods from the prior period
information since the information has not been prepared on a comparable
basis.

Unamortized premiums related to recording interest bearing assets and
liabilities at their fair market values as part of fresh start are as
follows (dollars in thousands):

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

1. Principles of Consolidation and Reorganization (continued)

The premiums are being amortized over the estimated remaining average
contractual lives of the related assets and liabilities utilizing the
interest method of amortization and giving consideration to the estimated
prepayment speeds and actual prepayment experience of the various loans and
securities.

The net effect on income, before income taxes, of the amortization of
premiums related to the fresh start adjustments was a decrease in income of
$586,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 and an increase of income of
$761,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Investment and Mortgage-Backed Securities

Investment and mortgage-backed securities are stated at cost, adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest
method. Gains or losses on the sale of these securities are recognized using
the specific identification method at the time of sale. Management has the
intent and the Association has the ability to hold these securities to
maturity.

The fair values for investments and mortgage-backed securities are based on
quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values based on quoted market prices of comparable
instruments are used.

In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 115," Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". The new statement supersedes
FASB Statement No. 12, "Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities", and
generally replaces the long-standing historical cost accounting approach to
debt securities with one based on fair value. The Association will
implement FAS 115 during 1994. Management believes the effect of adopting
FAS 115 will not be significant.

Loans

For real estate construction loans, which have a weighted average maturity
of less than one year, fair value approximates the carrying value. The fair
values for real estate mortgage and consumer and other loans are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being
offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality
and prepayment rates published by the Federal Home Loan Bank. The estimated
fair values of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Loans (continued)

timeshare and lots contract receivables purchased from Fairfield
approximated their carrying amounts based on prior year third-party
valuations and consideration of market rate fluctuations since that time.
The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates its fair value.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by
management to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio. Management's
determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of
the portfolio, past loan loss experience, current economic conditions,
volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, and other relevant
factors. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged
against income.

Real Estate Owned

Real estate owned includes property acquired for development or sale,
acquired in settlement of loans or through in-substance foreclosures. Real
estate is generally considered foreclosed in-substance when: (1) the debtor
has little or no equity in the real estate as compared to the current fair
market value of the property, (2) proceeds for repayment of the loan can be
expected to come only from the operation or the sale of the real estate, and
(3) the debtor has either: (a) formally or effectively abandoned control of
the real estate to the Association or (b) retained control of the real
estate but, because of the current financial condition of the debtor or the
economic prospects for the debtor and/or the real estate in the foreseeable
future, it is doubtful that the debtor will be able to rebuild equity in the
real estate or otherwise repay the loan in the foreseeable future. Real
estate acquired for development or sale or in settlement of loans and
properties classified as in-substance foreclosures are recorded at the lower
of cost or estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Loan losses
arising from the acquisition of such property are charged against the
allowance for loan losses.

Other investments in real estate are stated at the lower of cost or
estimated fair value. These investments are reviewed regularly and valuation
allowances are established when recorded values exceed estimated fair
values. Interest charges during the period of construction, development or
improvements, if applicable, are capitalized. After construction or
improvements are complete, interest charges are expensed as a period cost.
Loans aggregating approximately $1,767,000 in 1993 and $5,064,000 and
$1,592,000 during the six months ended December 31, 1992 and June 30, 1992,
respectively and $15,357,000 during 1991, were transferred to real estate
owned.

Association of Charlotte and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. The provision for depreciation and amortization is computed
principally by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives
of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line
method over the terms of the related leases.

Revenue Recognition

Interest on loans is accrued and credited to operations based upon the
principal amount outstanding. The Association provides an allowance for loss
for uncollected interest when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to
principal or interest or when, in management's opinion, there is doubt as to
the collectibility of the interest. Such interest ultimately collected is
credited to income in the period of recovery.

Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination
costs are being deferred and the net amount amortized as an adjustment of
the related loan's yield. The Association is generally amortizing these
amounts over the contractual life of the related loans using the interest
method. Commitment fees based on a percentage of a customer's unused line of
credit and fees related to stand-by letters of credit are recognized over
the commitment period.

Loan Servicing Income

The Association retains a servicing fee for servicing loans sold to
investors. The servicing fee is accrued and credited to operations based
upon the principal amount outstanding. From time to time the Association may
sell portions of its servicing portfolio. Gains, if any, on such sales are
recognized at the time of sale.

Income Taxes

The Association and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax
return with Fairfield. The Association qualifies as a savings and loan for
tax purposes.

The Association adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board as of June 30, 1992 as part of the reorganization;
therefore, no cumulative effect adjustment to operations has been recorded.
Under the accounting method specified by SFAS 109, a deferred tax asset or
liability is recognized based on the estimated future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. The measurement of
deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for
the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not
expected to be realized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Association considers federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits with
other financial institutions, as well as all other highly liquid investment
securities with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. Federal funds are generally purchased and sold for one-day
periods.

The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash
equivalents approximates its fair value.

Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank

The fair values of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses based on rates currently available to
the Association for advances with similar terms and remaining maturities.

Savings Deposits

The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, passbook and statement
savings, and money market accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount
payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts).

Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted
cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on
certificates in the Association's market area to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities of such deposits.

Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments

Fair values for the Association's off-balance-sheet instruments are based on
fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account
the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties credit
standing.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in the 1992 and 1991 financial
statements to conform with classifications used as of December 31, 1993.

receivable greater than 90 days delinquent, since these contracts receivable
meet the in-substance foreclosure criteria. In addition, the Association
has acquired $2.8 million of timeshare and lot inventory located at various
Fairfield sites related to respective contracts receivable which have
canceled. The Association has reduced its carrying value in these amounts
by an allowance totaling $1.8 million which represents amounts applied in
accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement (See Note 11). $620,000 and
$1,173,000 were applied to the defaulted contracts in accordance with the
Tax Sharing agreement for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

The Association had net revenue relating to real estate owned of
approximately $582,400 for the year ended December 31, 1993 and $120,100 for
the six months ended June 30, 1992, and net expenses of approximately

For tax reporting purposes the Association is allowed a special bad debt
deduction computed under the percentage of taxable income (PTI) method or
the experience method (which may be computed using the six year moving
average or the "fill up method"), whichever is more beneficial. The PTI
method generally is limited to approximately 8 percent of taxable income,
subject to certain limitations based on aggregate loan and savings account
balances at the end of the year. If the PTI method is elected, actual losses
are not deductible. Under the experience method, the Association's bad debt
deduction is computed based on actual loan losses.

11. Income Taxes (continued)

Effective June 1, 1989, the Association entered into a tax sharing agreement
(the "tax sharing agreement") with Fairfield which provides that the
Association will remit to Fairfield, an amount equal to the estimated
federal income taxes for which the Association would have been liable if it
filed a separate consolidated income tax return. The tax sharing agreement
was subject to a potential amendment as detailed in a Bankruptcy Court order
dated October 22, 1991 approving a Settlement Agreement between the
Association, the OTS and Fairfield. The agreement was executed at the time
Fairfields Plan of Reorganization was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.
The Settlement Agreement contained an amendment to the tax sharing agreement
(the "Agreement") that was effective for all amounts due and payable under
the Agreement that were unpaid at the time Fairfields' Plan of
Reorganization was confirmed or thereafter and that first became due and
payable on or after October 3, 1990.

In addition, prior to the confirmation date of Fairfield's Plan of
Reorganization ("Confirmation Date") (as defined by the Agreement entered
into in connection with the settlement agreement) the Association retained
25% and after the Confirmation Date 50% of any amounts otherwise payable to
Fairfield under the tax sharing agreement and has applied such amounts
against the defaulted contract account (see Note 13). The 50% of amounts
otherwise payable to Fairfield shall continue to be applied to the defaulted
contract account until each of the following requirements has been met: (i)
the balance of the defaulted contract account is zero or a negative amount;
(ii) the Association's tangible capital equals or exceeds the aggregate
principal amount of the Association's contract receivable portfolio, (iii)
Fairfield is not in bankruptcy or in material payment default under any loan
agreement to which it is a party; (iv) the Association is in compliance with
its minimum regulatory capital requirements; and (v) the members of the
affiliated group of which Fairfield is the common parent have had net income
on a consolidated basis for any three of the preceding four most recent
quarters. Thereafter, so long as the Association has been made " whole,"
Fairfield will receive all tax sharing payments to which it is otherwise
entitled and will retain all cash and contract proceeds received from the
remarketing effort. At December 31, 1993, the Association has recorded
approximately $1.8 million as a reduction of real estate owned, because it
is subject to application against the defaulted contract account as
described above.

The Association paid approximately $571,000 and $2,750,000, (including
$545,000 and $2,700,000, paid to Fairfield) of income taxes during the years
ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and $25,800 during the year
ended December 31, 1991. Income taxes applicable to gains on sale of
mortgage-backed securities totaled $28,560 in 1991.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

The Association leases its main office space and four branch facilities
under noncancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year. The
following is a schedule of minimum rental payments (dollars in thousands):

Period Ending December 31:
1994 $ 334
1995 333
1996 187
1997 133
1998 80
Thereafter 224

$ 1,291

Rental expense aggregated approximately $318,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1993 and $228,000 and $189,000 for the six months ended
December 31, 1992 and June 30, 1992, respectively, and $469,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1991. Certain of the lease agreements contain options to
renew at various dates for periods up to five years.

On December 10, 1993, Charlotte T. Curry, who purchased a lot from Fairfield
under an installment sale contract subsequently sold to the Association,
filed suit against the Association, currently pending in Superior Court in
Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, alleging breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty and unfair trade practices. The litigation, which seeks
class action certification, contests the method by which Fairfield
calculated refunds for lot purchasers whose installment sale contracts were
canceled due to failure to complete payment of the deferred purchase price
for the lot. Most installment lot sale contracts require Fairfield to
refund to a defaulting purchaser the amount paid in principal, after
deducting the greater of (a) 15% of the purchase price of the lot or (b)
Fairfields' actual damages. The plaintiff disputes Fairfield's method of
calculating actual damages, which has historically included certain sales,
marketing and other expenses. In the case of Ms. Curry's lot, the amount of
refund claimed as having been improperly retained is approximately $3,600.
Fairfield estimates that the potential number of people who might be
included in the class definition in the CURRY litigation against the
Association (including certain people subject to statute of limitation and
other defenses and contracts where Fairfield, instead of First Federal, were
economically the party of interest) is less than 165 lot purchasers, with
refund claims amounting in the aggregate to several hundred thousand
dollars. The CURRY lawsuit seeks damages, punitive damages, treble damages
under North Carolina law for unfair trade practices, prejudgment interest
and attorney's fees and costs.

The Association intends to defend the CURRY litigation vigorously. No
provision for liability has been made in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

12. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

The Association is also involved in various other pending litigation
relating to matters that are in the ordinary course of the Association's
business activities. The results of these litigation proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty; however in the opinion of the Association's
management, the Association does not have a potential liability in
connection with these other proceedings which would have an adverse material
effect on the financial condition of the Association.

13. Transactions with Related Parties

The Association has had, and expects to have in the future, transactions in
the ordinary course of business with its officers and directors. Such
transactions have been on similar terms, including interest rates and
collateral on loans, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with others, and have involved no more than normal risk or
other potential unfavorable aspects. Loans made to officers and directors
(including companies in which they are principal owners) amounted to
approximately $1,813,000 and $1,514,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 1993, $281,000 new loans
were originated, $271,000 were refinanced and repayments aggregated
$253,000. At December 31, 1993, the Association held $745,000 of property in
real estate owned which was acquired from a partnership for which a
subsidiary of Fairfield was the general partner. The loan pursuant to which
the Association took possession of the property was made prior to the
acquisition of the Association by Fairfield. Subsequent to December 31,
1993, the Association sold this property for approximately book value.

Fairfield services the lot and timeshare contracts sold to the Association
in prior years for a fee of .5% per annum (approximately $328,000 for the
year ended December 31, 1993 and $205,000 and $236,000 for the six months
ended December 31, 1992 and June 30, 1992, respectively, and $564,000 for
the year ended 1991), on the outstanding principal balance of such contracts.

In May 1991, Fairfield notified the Association that it could no longer
honor its repurchase commitment and subsequent repurchases of contract
receivables over 90 days delinquent or which have been canceled. The
Association classifies all contract receivables over 90 days delinquent or
which have canceled and which have not been repurchased by Fairfield
("defaulted contracts") as real estate owned, since the defaulted contracts
meet the in-substance foreclosure criteria. At December 31, 1993 and 1992,
the Association held $3,714,000 and $4,765,000, respectively, of defaulted
contracts in real estate owned.

13. Transactions with Related Parties (continued)

In connection with the confirmation of the Plans, the Association entered
into a Servicing Agreement with Fairfield, under which Fairfield would
continue to service the Association's contracts receivable portfolio on
essentially the same terms and conditions, including the .5% servicing fee,
as set forth in the interim Servicing Agreement. Additionally, Fairfield
and the Association entered into a Remarketing Agreement whereby Fairfield
agreed to use its best efforts to remarket timeshare and lots underlying
canceled Association contracts receivable and replace those contracts with
new contracts generated by the remarketing efforts. Fairfield is entitled,
pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement, to retain cash downpayments up to 40%
of cash sales and all down payments, except for the amount of any down
payment that exceeds 50% of the gross sales price of the remarketed
inventory. In addition, under the amended Tax Sharing Agreement, the
Association retained 25% and after confirmation, 50% of any amounts
otherwise payable to Fairfield under the Tax Sharing Agreement and applied
such amounts against the balance of unremarketed canceled contracts
receivable plus accrued interest thereon, less any proceeds or tax sharing
amounts retained by the Association (Defaulted Contract Account) (see Note
11). Prior to the confirmation of the Plans, the Association and Fairfield
operated under interim remarketing and service agreements authorized by the
Bankruptcy Court with terms similar to those described above.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, Fairfield remarketed approximately
$1.2 million of canceled contracts receivable at amounts which approximated
book value. During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Association paid
$545,000 to Fairfield in accordance with the terms of the Tax Sharing
Agreement.

The Association maintained a general valuation allowance for contract
receivables purchased from Fairfield of $1,150,000 at December 31, 1993.

14. Supplemental Cash Flows Information

The Association paid $13,171,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
$7,103,000 and $11,840,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992 and
June 30, 1992, respectively, and $31,431,000 for the year ended 1991 in
interest on deposits and other borrowings.

15. Preferred Stock

The Association is authorized to issue 7,500,000 shares of $.01 par value
preferred stock. No preferred shares have been issued.

16. Regulatory Matters

On September 29, 1992, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) together with
other federal banking regulatory agencies, adopted rules to implement the
"prompt corrective action" provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991 ("the Act"). Significant
requirements of the Act include minimum capital and asset ratios and a
"risk-based" capital to "risk-weighted" asset ratio. Under the new rules,
which were effective December 19, 1992, a thrift institution is "well
capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5% or
greater and is not subject to any order to meet and maintain a specific
capital level. At December 31, 1993, the Association had a total risk-based
capital ratio of 14.00%, and a Tier 1 risk-based ratio and a leverage ratio
of 8.35%.

The OTS may require an adequately capitalized savings association to comply
with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the
savings association were in the next lower capital category if the OTS
determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that in its most
recent examination, the savings association received, and has not corrected,
a less-than-satisfactory rating for any of the equivalent MACRO rating
categories for asset quality, management, earnings, or liquidity.

Beginning in 1990, thrifts were required to deduct from assets and, thus,
from capital a percentage of the aggregate amount of investments in and
extensions of credit to subsidiaries that engage in activities not
permissible for national banks, subject to certain exceptions. These
percentage deductions increase on an accelerating basis over a period ending
June 30, 1994, after which time all such investments and extensions of
credit will be deducted from capital. At December 31, 1993, the Association
had approximately $3,872,000 or 1% of assets invested in and loaned to
subsidiaries which may be deemed to be engaged in activities not permissible
for national banks or otherwise not permitted under FIRREA. Management
believes that the Association will be able to reduce or dispose of these
investments within the periods provided in FIRREA without adversely
affecting its operations.

At December 31, 1993, the Association's total qualified thrift investments
as a percentage of total tangible assets was 69.5%, which exceeded the
minimum of 65% required by the Act.

16. Regulatory Matters (continued)

On August 26, 1992, the Association and the OTS entered into a revised
Supervisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Association agreed, except for
certain enumerated transactions, that neither the Association nor any of its
subsidiaries would enter into any transaction with Fairfield or any of its
subsidiaries without the prior written approval of the Regional Director of
the OTS.

The Association is prohibited from making dividend payments to Fairfield
without prior approval from the OTS.

17. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The Association is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its
customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit and loans sold to third parties subject to repurchase
agreements. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of
credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The
contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of
involvement the Association has in particular classes of financial
instruments.

The Association's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit
and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of
those instruments. The Association uses the same credit policies in making
commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet
instruments.

Unless noted otherwise, the Association does not require collateral or other
security to support financial instruments with credit risk.

Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk are as
follows (dollars in thousands):

17. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk (continued)

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Association
evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The
amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Association upon
extension of credit is based on management' s credit evaluation of the
counterparty. Collateral held varies but generally includes commercial or
residential real estate.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Association to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is generally the same as
that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.

Repurchase agreements generally require the Association to repurchase loans
that do not meet the standards of the loan purchase agreements or that
become delinquent within a stated period of time after being sold to the
permanent investor. The Association has purchased special risk insurance
against the recourse obligation on $12.6 million of loan sales as of
December 31, 1993.

18. Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Association's business activity is primarily with customers located in
the state of North Carolina. At December 31, 1993, the Association had
approximately $7.8 million of real estate construction loans and loan
commitments. All real estate construction loans are reviewed by senior
management and approved by the Association's Loan Committee. The Association
requires collateral on all real estate construction loans and generally
maintains loan to value ratios of no greater than 80%. At December 31, 1993,
the Association has approximately $52.6 million of outstanding lot and
timeshare contract receivables, which were purchased from Fairfield. The lot
and timeshare contract receivables are regionally diversified. A minimum
downpayment of 10% was generally required for these lot and timeshare
contract receivables. See Note 13 for additional information concerning the
credit risk associated with the lot and timeshare contract receivables
purchased from Fairfield.

19. Sale of Loans

During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Association sold $48.4, $47 and $18.6
million, respectively, of first mortgage loans to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation for $48.7, $47.4 and $19.3 million, respectively. The
Association realized a gain on the loan sales of $276,000 in 1993 and
$340,000 and $56,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992 and June 30,
1992, respectively, and $718,000 for the year ended 1991.

20. Subsequent Event

Subsequent to December 31, 1993, it is anticipated that Fairfield will enter
into a definitive agreement to sell its stock in the Association. The
purchase price of approximately $40 million is to be paid partially in cash
and partially through the conveyance of certain real estate owned,
classified loans and other assets. The sale is subject to numerous
conditions, including completion of due diligence to the satisfaction of the
acquirer and obtaining approvals from Fairfield's lenders and various state
and federal regulatory authorities.

Security Capital Bancorp
Notes to Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statements Of Income
For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 1994
(Unaudited)

a. The unaudited pro forma financial information
presented herein gives effect to the acquisition
of First Federal Savings and Loan Association
of Charlotte ("First Federal"), by Security
Capital Bancorp ("SCBC"), as if the transaction
had occurred at the beginning of the periods
presented. The acquisition is being accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting, which
requires that all assets and liabilities be
adjusted to their fair market values as of the
date of the acquisition.

The pro forma financial information is
presented for informational purposes only and
is not necessarily indicative of actual
results that would have been achieved had the
transaction been consummated at the beginning
of the periods presented. For example,
management is of the opinion that SCBC will
gain certain efficiencies as a result of the
acquisition; however, the benefits from such
efficiencies are not reflected herein.

b. The adjustment to interest income includes the
estimated loss of interest income on the cash
purchase price of approximately $41 million,
computed at an estimated average federal funds
sold rate (3.88%) for the period then ended.
Also included, is the loss of interest income on
the First Federal assets, which amounted to
approximately $3,907,000, which were excluded from
the purchase ("excluded assets"). The
amortization of the fair value adjustment to
loans ($1,491,000) amortized over ten years using
the sum-of-the-years digits method ($203,000)
increased interest income. An additional increase
to interest income resulted from the cash received
by SCBC from Fairfield Communities, Inc., the
former parent of First Federal, for the sale of
the excluded assets ($57,234,000) reinvested at an
estimated average federal funds sold rate (3.88%).

c. The adjustment to interest expense is due
to the amortization of the fair value adjustments
to deposit accounts ($1,219,000) over five years
using the sum-of-the-years digits method
($305,000) and Federal Home Loan Bank Advances
($419,000) using the straight line method over
three years ($105,000).

d. The adjustment to other expense is due to the
amortization of the excess of costs over the fair
value of net assets acquired, or goodwill
($12,459,000), over an estimated life of twenty
years ($467,000), the amortization of the core
deposit intangible ($3,222,000) over an estimated
life of ten years, using the sum-of-the-years
digits method ($439,000), and the amortization of
a fair value adjustment to mortgage servicing
rights ($1,042,000) over ten years using the
sum-of-the-years digits method ($142,000).

e. Tax benefit using SCBC's estimated federal
effective tax rate excluding the effects of
one-time charges (33.3%).
