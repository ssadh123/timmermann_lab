among COMPUTERLAND CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(the "Seller"), MERISEL FAB, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Buyer"), and, for purposes of Section
2.2 hereof, MERISEL, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Merisel").

The Seller is engaged in the sale, distribution and servicing of
microcomputer systems and related products and services throughout the world.
Through its United States Franchise and Distribution Division, the Seller is
engaged in the business (the "Subject Business") of granting franchises to
dealers of microcomputer systems and products located in the Designated
Territory (as defined in Section 1.1(a)) and conducting the wholesale
distribution of microcomputer systems and products to such franchisees and to
independent dealers located in the Designated Territory. The Seller desires to
sell, transfer, convey and assign to the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to
purchase and acquire from the Seller, certain assets and rights of the Seller
relating to the Subject Business, subject to the assumption by the Buyer of
certain obligations and liabilities of the Seller, in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. For convenience of
reference, the Seller's businesses other than the Subject Business are referred
to herein as the "Retained Businesses".

The Buyer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merisel, which has been
organized by Merisel for the purpose of acquiring the Subject Business from the
Seller. In connection therewith, and as an inducement for the Seller to execute
and deliver this Agreement with the Buyer, Merisel is executing and delivering
to the Seller simultaneously herewith a Guaranty Agreement (the "Guaranty
Agreement") with respect to the payment and performance by the Buyer of all
Guaranteed Obligations (as defined therein), including, without limitation, the
obligations of the Buyer under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2 hereof.

purposes of this Agreement. The Buyer shall, at any time and from time to time
following the Closing, at the request of the Seller, execute, acknowledge and

constitute an agreement

-8-
<PAGE>

or an attempted agreement to transfer or assign any Contract or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted
transfer or assignment thereof, without the consent of any other party thereto,
would constitute a breach thereof or in any way affect the rights of the Buyer
thereunder. The Seller and the Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of any such other party to the transfer or assignment thereof to the
Buyer in all cases in which such consent is required; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall be required to incur any further
obligations or liabilities in obtaining any such consent, except for ordinary
and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith, which
expenses shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller. In connection
therewith, the Seller shall not modify or amend any of the terms of any Contract
in order to obtain the consent from such other party to the transfer or

effect on the date hereof (or as modified with the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (iii) in enforcing

court of competent jurisdiction (but such obligation to prosecute shall not

Seller recovers any amount from any such non-consenting Datago Purchaser
relating to any post-closing periods, such recovery shall be paid over to the
Buyer net of the Monthly Distribution Fee contemplated by clause (vi) below, (v)
the Seller shall provide to the Buyer the economic benefits that the Buyer would
have received under such Datago Agreements and the Services Agreement if such
non-consenting Datago Purchasers had consented thereto, (vi)

1.9(b) shall be included as sales made by the Merisel Group, or

accounts receivable, royalties and other fees owed to the Seller by any
Franchisee or any Datago Purchaser for sales of products by the Seller to such
Franchisee or Datago Purchaser which occurred within [*] days prior to the
Closing Date or with respect to any obligation to pay royalties under any
Franchise Agreement arising within [*] days prior to the Closing Date (all such
amounts being referred to as "Seller Receivables").

(b) Without limiting Section 1.10(a), in the event any Franchisee or
Datago Purchaser fails to pay in full by March 31, 1994 all Seller Receivables
owed by such Franchisee or Datago Purchaser to the Seller, the Buyer shall, upon
the Seller's request, withhold shipment of products to each such Franchisee and
Datago Purchaser until all such Seller Receivables are paid in full by such
Franchisee or Datago Purchaser; provided, however, that if any such Franchisee
-------- ------- 
or Datago Purchaser shall have expressed in writing a bona fide dispute with
---- ---- 
respect to its obligation to pay any Seller Receivable, then the Buyer shall not
be obligated to withhold shipments to such Franchisee or Datago Purchaser (it
being understood and agreed that no alleged dispute relating to any Seller
Receivables based on any obligation to make royalty payments with respect to any
obligation arising within 90 days prior to the Closing Date from any Franchisee
shall relieve the Buyer from its obligation to withhold shipment under this
Section 1.10(b)).

1.11. Franchisee Audits. During the 24-month period after the
----------------- 
Closing, the Buyer shall conduct audits of the records of those Franchisees
selected by the Seller and for such periods ending on or prior to the Closing as

-------- ------- 
not be obligated to conduct more than one audit per Franchisee with respect to
any period; provided further, however, that such audits shall be conducted by
-------- ------- ------- 
the Buyer in a manner that is consistent with the methodology used by the Seller
in conducting audits of the Franchisees prior to the Closing. The Buyer shall
advise the Seller of the results of each such audit in writing within ten days
of the completion thereof. The increase of any

as amended.

-10-
<PAGE>

amount owing by any Franchisee to the Seller determined as a result of any such
audit shall be for the benefit of the Seller. All expenses incurred by the
Buyer in conducting audits of the records of Franchisees for periods prior to
the Closing shall be paid for promptly by the Seller (it being understood that
the cost to the Seller of such audits shall not exceed the cost thereof to the
Seller prior to the Closing); provided, however, that if the Buyer shall conduct
-------- ------- 
an audit of any Franchisee for any period following the Closing at the same time
as the Buyer shall have conducted a pre-Closing audit of such Franchisee, then
the Buyer's expenses incurred in conducting such audit shall be allocated
proportionately based on the amount of time of the pre-Closing and post-Closing
periods being audited.

If (A) the net percentage point change determined by comparing the First

-16-
<PAGE>

(e) By way of example:

(A) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 120
Second Year Volume = 130
Net Percentage Point Increase = 50 (i.e., the sum of
20, or the 120 over 100,
and 30, or the increase
of 130 over 100)

Payment: $6,000,000 plus 50 times $200,000 = $16,000,000

(B) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 140
Second Year Volume = 140
Net Percentage Point Increase = 80 (i.e., the sum of
40, or the 140 over 100,
and 40, or the increase
of the next 140 over 100)

Payment: $6,000,000 plus 80 times $200,000 = $22,000,000

(C) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 160
Second Year Volume = 60
Net Percentage Point Increase = 20 (i.e., the sum of
60, or 160 over 100, and
negative 40, or the
decrease of 100 to 60)

Payment: $6,000,000 plus 20 times $200,000 = $10,000,000

(D) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 50
Second Year Volume = 100
Net Percentage Point Increase = negative 50 (i.e., the
sum of negative 50, or
the decrease of 100 to
50, and 0, or the
increase of 100 over 100)

Payment: 0

(f) Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall keep accurate records which
shall be sufficient for the computation of Eligible Volume for all relevant
periods hereunder and, upon reasonable advance notice, shall make such records
available to the other and such other's independent public accountants for
inspection during normal business hours. The expenses of any

-17-
<PAGE>

such inspection shall be borne by the inspecting party unless such inspection
reveals that Eligible Volume for any period certified hereunder was inaccurate
by $1 million or more and resulted in or would have resulted in an incorrect
payment to or by the inspecting party.

(g) The parties acknowledge that if any Open Distribution Vendor
engages in Open Distribution, the Subject Business and the Other Distribution
Business may compete with one another in connection with some or all of the
Products of such Open Distribution Vendor. In that regard, during the Earnout
Period the Merisel Group will not engage in any practice if it is reasonably
established that the principal purpose of such practice is (i) to reduce or
minimize the Earnout Amount or (ii) to render the Buyer Subject Business
uncompetitive vis-a-vis the Other Distribution Business in a manner that is not
reasonably justifiable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Merisel Group will conduct the Buyer Subject Business and the Other Distribution
Business in accordance with the following general guidelines, consistent with
reasonable and prudent business practices:

(iii) The Merisel Group shall not cause or permit the Other
Distribution Business to adopt or pursue any programs or policies, or any
general terms and conditions with respect to the sale of Products, that
alone or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in
incremental sales of such Products being made for net consideration below
the marginal cost to the Other Distribution Business of such Products
unless such sale is justifiable in light of competitive business conditions
or is for the purpose of achieving higher rebate levels or liquidating
excess inventory;

(iv) The Merisel Group shall not prevent or prohibit the Buyer
Subject Business from adopting or pursuing any programs or policies, or
setting any pricing or other terms and conditions with respect to the
purchase or sale of Products, that the management of the Buyer Subject
Business reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Buyer
Subject Business, except to the extent that (A) any such programs,
policies, pricing or other terms or conditions, alone or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in incremental sales of Products
being made for net consideration below the marginal cost to the Buyer
Subject Business of such Products or (B) such programs, policies, pricing
or other terms or conditions are not likely to provide the Buyer Subject
Business with a competitive return on investment, taking into account,
without limitation, the risks associated with such programs, policies,
terms and conditions, the impact on the cost structure of the Buyer Subject
Business and the capital investment made and to be made in the Buyer
Subject Business

-18-
<PAGE>

(including, without limitation, the purchase price payable by Buyer
hereunder and the financing costs associated with operating the Buyer
Subject Business); and

(v) For purposes of the guideline set forth in clause (i) above,
for any period in which Applicable Revenue (as defined in the Services
Agreement) is reasonably projected to be in excess of Baseline Revenue (as
defined in the Services Agreement) for such period, the Merisel Group shall
assume that the marginal cost to the Other Distribution Business of any
incremental sale of such Products is at least [*] above the vendor cost of
the Products sold (without giving effect to any programs, policies, pricing
or other terms or conditions adopted by the Other Distribution Business
after the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to increase such
marginal cost).

(h) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, for
any period in which any Open Distribution Vendor engages in Open Distribution,
any member of the Merisel Group breaches any of its obligations under Section
2.2(g), the Inventory Cost of those Products of such Open Distribution Vendor
sold by any member of the Merisel Group in connection with the Other
Distribution Business as a result of such violation will be included in Eligible
Volume for such period for all purposes of this Section 2.2. The legal fees and
expenses incurred by any party in connection with any legal action involving an
alleged breach by the Buyer and/or the Merisel Group, or any member thereof, of
Section 2.2(g) shall be borne by the party who shall not prevail in such
dispute.

(i) In the event that, at any time during the Earnout Period, there is
a material increase, decrease or change in the product lines of any Eligible
Vendor sold under the name of such Eligible Vendor, as a result of any merger,
acquisition, divestiture, reorganization or other event, Merisel, the Buyer and
the Seller shall cooperate with one another in good faith and use their
respective best efforts to agree on an appropriate modification of the products
included in measuring the Base Volume and Eligible Volume, so that the
comparisons between Base Volume and Eligible Volume provided for in this Section
2.2 shall better serve the purposes of this Section 2.2.

(j) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during
the Earnout Period the Buyer shall not assign or delegate to any other person or
entity any rights or interests of the Buyer in, to or under any franchise
agreement, distribution agreement or other similar instrument or agreement
between the Buyer and any Buyer Datago Purchaser or Buyer

amended.

Franchisee without the prior written consent of the Seller, and any such
assignment or delegation (or attempted assignment or delegation) shall be void

ab initio; provided, however, that the Buyer may make such an assignment or
- - - -- ------ -------- ------- 
delegation to any member of the Merisel Group without the consent of the Seller
so long as all amounts that otherwise would have been included in Eligible
Volume (assuming that such member of the Merisel Group was the Buyer) shall
continue to be so included; provided further, however, that the Seller shall not
-------- ------- ------- 
unreasonably withhold its consent to any other such assignment or delegation so
long as arrangements are made, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Seller, to
provide for the inclusion in Eligible Volume of all amounts that otherwise would
have been included in Eligible Volume (assuming that such assignee or delegatee
was the Buyer).

(k) Except as provided in Section 5.7 of the Services Agreement, the
obligations of the Buyer and Merisel under this Section 2.2, including, without
limitation, the obligation to pay the Earnout Amount and other amounts due under
this Section 2.2, shall be absolute and unconditional, without any right of
offset whatsoever.

2.3. Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be
---------------------------- 
allocated among the Purchased Assets and the Restrictive Covenant in accordance
with the allocation set forth on Annex 2.3 hereto and the Seller and the Buyer
--------- 
shall prepare their Federal, state and local income tax returns employing such
allocation.

-35-
<PAGE>

relating thereto on or prior to the Survival Date, if any, applicable to any

---------------------------------------- 
or proceeding (a "Proceeding") brought by a third party against a Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be (the "Indemnified Party"),
with respect to which the Buyer or Seller may have an indemnification obligation
under this Article VII, shall be defended (including all proceedings on appeal
or for review which counsel for the defendant shall deem appropriate) by the
Indemnifying Party, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnifying
Party, using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided,
-------- 
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the
- - - ------- 
defense of any Proceeding if (i) such Proceeding seeks an injunction,
restraining order, declaratory relief or other nonmonetary relief and, if
decided adversely, such Proceeding could have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Indemnified Party or (ii) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party and (A) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that
there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party and
(B) in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party, counsel for
the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the interests of the
Indemnifying Party because such interests could be in conflict with those of the
Indemnifying Party; provided,however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
-------- ------- 
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnified
Party. In addition, if the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense of
any Proceeding within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such
Proceeding from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall (upon further
notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to assume the defense of such
Proceeding.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of a
Proceeding (under circumstances in which the proviso to the Section 7.4(a) is
not applicable), the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for any legal
or other defense costs subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not
exercise its right to assume defense of a Proceeding (but is not otherwise
restricted from so assuming such defense by the first proviso to Section
7.4(a)), it shall nevertheless be entitled to participate in such defense with
its own counsel and the fees and expenses of both counsel to the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall be aggregated and borne by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a
Proceeding because it is restricted from assuming such defense by the first
proviso to Section 7.4(a), it shall nevertheless be entitled to

-36-
<PAGE>

participate in such defense with its own counsel and the fees and expenses of
both counsel to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall be
aggregated and borne 50% by the Indemnifying Party and 50% by the Indemnified
Party.

(c) Regardless of which party is controlling the defense of any
Proceeding, the controlling party shall keep the other party fully informed of
such Proceeding at all stages thereof, whether or not it is so represented, the
party not controlling the defense of such Proceeding shall make available to the
other party all books and records of such party relating to such Proceeding and
the parties hereto shall render to each other such assistance as they may
reasonably require of each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of such Proceeding.

(d) The party controlling the defense of any Proceeding shall not
make any settlement of any action, suit or proceeding without the written
consent of the other party which, consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

7.5. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. (a)
----------------------------------------------------- 
Subject to the further provisions of this Article VII, the representations and
warranties of the Seller contained in Section 3.1 and the representations and
warranties of the Buyer contained in Section 3.3 shall survive the Closing and
shall terminate at the end of the 18th month after the date of the Closing;

provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties of the Seller set
- - - -------- ------- 
forth in the first sentence of Section 3.1(g) hereof shall survive the Closing
and remain in full force and effect until the fifth anniversary of the Closing
and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in Sections
3.1(a), (b), (c), (h), (i) and (o) hereof shall survive the Closing and remain
in full force and effect until the 30th month anniversary of the Closing (each
of the foregoing termination dates, a "Survival Date"). Any representation or
warranty which would otherwise terminate after a Survival Date shall survive
until the final adjudication or settlement of any claim for the breach thereof
if notice of any inaccuracy or breach thereof, including a reasonably detailed
description of such alleged inaccuracy or breach, shall have been given in
writing to the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, on or prior to a
Survival Date.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all
covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in
full force and effect without time limit.

7.6. Limitations on Indemnification. Anything contained herein to
------------------------------ 
the contrary notwithstanding, the Seller shall not be obligated under Section
7.1(a) for the payment of Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee unless and
until, and

-37-
<PAGE>

only to the extent that, the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by all
Buyer Indemnitees with respect to which the Seller is obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1(a) exceeds the amount by which
$1,000,000 is greater than the aggregate amount, if any, incurred by the Buyer
in connection with those matters set forth on Schedule 7.6; provided, however,
------------ -------- ------- 
that in no event shall Losses for which the Seller shall be liable under Section
7.1(a) exceed in the aggregate $25,000,000. Anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Buyer shall not be obligated under Section 7.2(a)
for the payment of Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnitee unless and until,
and only to the extent that, the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by all
Seller Indemnitees with respect to which the Buyer is obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a) exceeds $1,000,000; provided,
-------- 
however, that in no event shall Losses for which the Buyer shall be liable under
- - - ------- 
Section 7.2(a) exceed in the aggregate $25,000,000.

7.7. Remedies Exclusive. The rights of the parties to
------------------ 
indemnification under this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive
contractual right or remedy in connection with any Losses arising from or in
connection with this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

ADDITIONAL POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS

8.1. Mutual Protection of Goodwill in Trademarks, Etc. (a) The
------------------------------------------------- 
Buyer acknowledges the validity, value and goodwill in the "ComputerLand" name
and the Seller's proprietary rights therein with respect to the Seller's use
thereof anywhere in the world other than the Designated Territory. All parties
acknowledge that no right, title and interest with respect to the Trademarks and
the goodwill appurtenant thereto shall be retained by the Seller in the
Designated Territory. In order to protect such validity, value and goodwill, to
the extent the Buyer uses the "ComputerLand" name, the Buyer shall use the
"ComputerLand" name and any mark confusingly similar with the "ComputerLand"
name in a commercially reasonable manner at all times and shall protect its
rights in each such name in the same manner in which Merisel has previously
protected its rights in the proprietary trade names, service marks and
trademarks of Merisel. The Buyer shall not challenge or interfere with the
Seller's use or ownership of the "ComputerLand" name or use or seek to register
or otherwise establish rights in the "ComputerLand" name, or any confusingly
similar name, anywhere in the world other than in the Designated Territory.

(b) The Seller acknowledges the validity, value and goodwill in the
Trademarks and the Buyer's proprietary rights therein within the Designated
Territory following the Closing.

-38-
<PAGE>

In order to protect such validity, value and goodwill, to the extent the Seller
uses one or more of the Trademarks, or any mark confusingly similar with one or
more of the Trademarks, outside of the Designated Territory, the Seller shall
use such terms in a commercially reasonably manner at all times and shall
protect its rights in such names in the same manner in which the Seller has
previously protected its rights in the Trademarks anywhere in the world and in
the same manner in which the Seller protects its rights in any other proprietary
trade names, service marks and Trademarks owned by the Seller. The Seller shall
not challenge or interfere with the Buyer's use or ownership of any of the
Trademarks or use or seek to register or otherwise attempt to establish rights
in any mark confusingly similar with any of the Trademarks anywhere within the
Designated Territory.

8.2. Seller's Restrictive Covenant. (a) Except in connection with
----------------------------- 
the performance of the agreements set forth in Section 1.5 hereof, from the
Closing until the 36th monthly anniversary of the Closing (the "Restriction
Period"), the Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in the sale or
distribution of microcomputers or similar products to third party resellers of
such products located anywhere in the Designated Territory; provided, however,
-------- ------- 
that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to:

(i) sales of any products to (A) any company that purchases such
products primarily for internal use, (B) any company that is engaged
in the resale of such products to third parties that are (1)
affiliates of such company or (2) otherwise engaged in an independent
business relationship with such company or an affiliate of such
company where the resale of such products is an ancillary activity of
such business relationship (e.g., an independent insurance broker that
acquires such products from a reseller division or subsidiary of an
insurance company or a hotel franchisee that acquires such products
from a reseller division or subsidiary of the hotel franchisor), (C)
any financial leasing company, (D) any rental company, (E) any company
engaged in the original equipment manufacturing of microcomputer
products, (F) any company set forth on Schedule 8.2 or (G) any company
------------ 
whose primary business involves either of the following activities:

(x) the purchase of products as agent for ultimate end-users
where such end-users are billed directly by the Seller for such
products; or

(y) the purchase of products which are integrated into end-
users' systems where such company retains title to such products;
or

(ii) sales of spare parts to any person or entity.

-39-
<PAGE>

As used in this Section 8.2, any legal entity or division thereof shall
constitute a "company" if such legal entity or division shall be the direct
purchaser of such products from the Seller. In addition, the Seller shall not,
during the Restriction Period, (1) perform any distribution services (including
configuration services) substantially similar to those provided to the Buyer
under the Services Agreement for computer resellers, aggregators or
distributors, (2) act as a franchisor with respect to franchisees that compete
with the Subject Business in any manner or (3) initiate any program if it is
reasonably established that the principal purpose of such program is to permit
the Seller to cause a third party reseller to change its method of doing
business so as to enable the Seller to be eligible to claim the benefit of
clause (G)(x) or (y) above. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Seller's performance under the Services Agreement
shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 8.2. In the event the Buyer and
the Seller shall enter into negotiations regarding the extension of the
Distribution Period (as defined in the Services Agreement), then it is the
intention of the Seller and the Buyer to discuss the extension of the
Restriction Period as part of conducting such negotiations.

(b) The Seller has carefully considered the nature and extent of the
restrictions set forth herein and acknowledges that the same are reasonable with
respect to scope, duration and territory. It is the desire and intent of the
Seller and the Buyer that the provisions of this Section 8.2 be enforced to the
fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement thereof is sought. Accordingly, if any
provision of this Section 8.2 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision, without any action on the part of the Seller or
the Buyer, shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom or to modify provisions
thereof so as to restrict (including, without limitation, a reduction in
duration, geographical area or prohibited business activities) the portion
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such deletion or modification to
apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular
jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made, and such deletion or
modification to be made only to the extent necessary to cause the provision as
amended to be valid and enforceable. It is further acknowledged that any
monetary remedy for any breach of the Seller's covenant set forth in Section
8.2(a) will be inadequate and that the Buyer will be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief against the Seller in addition to any other relief
or remedies to which the Buyer may be entitled, without the necessity of proving
actual damages.

8.3. Access. (a) To the extent permitted by applicable law or
------ 
existing contractual arrangement, the Seller shall, upon request, permit the
Buyer and its representatives, at reasonable times during normal business hours
and in a reasonable

-40-
<PAGE>

manner which is not disruptive to the operations of the Seller, to inspect and
to make copies of (at the expense of the Buyer) all records of the Seller
relating to the Subject Business prior to the Closing, including, without
limitation, sales and royalty records, accounting records and employee records.
The Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid entering into agreements
prohibiting or restricting the Buyer's access to the records of the Subject
Business. The Seller represents and warrants to the Buyer that, except with
respect to vendor agreements and agreements set forth on Schedule 8.3(a), there
--------------- 
are no existing contractual restrictions on the ability of the Seller to provide
access to such records to the Buyer. Any information provided pursuant to this
Section 8.3(a) shall be treated in accordance with Section 8.5. The Seller
shall not dispose of such records during the five-year period commencing with
the Closing without the Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Following the expiration of such five-year period,
the Seller may dispose of such records at any time following 90 days' prior
written notice to the Buyer. During such 90-day period, the Buyer shall have
the right, at the Buyer's sole expense, to take possession of all or any part of
such records at a time to be agreed upon by the Seller and the Buyer. In
addition to the foregoing, the Seller shall provide to the Buyer copies of, and
the Buyer shall have the nonexclusive right to use within the Designated
Territory, (i) all mailing addresses of and any other data relating to the
Franchisees and Datago Purchasers, (ii) all vendor lists relating to the Subject
Business and (iii all forms, catalogs, brochures, advertising materials,
training and marketing manuals and franchise and Datago operating manuals
relating to the Subject Business, including, without limitation, ACCESS
materials and materials relating to the Agreements, Program and services
referred to in Sections 1.2(k) through (n).

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable law or existing contractual
arrangement, the Buyer shall, upon request, permit the Seller and its
representatives, at reasonable times during normal business hours and in a
reasonable manner which is not disruptive to the operations of the Buyer, to
inspect and to make copies of (at the expense of the Seller) all records of the
Buyer relating to the Buyer Subject Business. The Buyer shall use its
reasonable efforts to avoid entering into agreements prohibiting or restricting
the Seller's access to the records of the Buyer Subject Business. The Buyer
represents and warrants to the Seller that, except with respect to vendor
agreements and agreements set forth on Schedule 8.3(b), there are no existing
--------------- 
contractual restrictions on the ability of the Buyer to provide access to such
records to the Seller. Any information provided pursuant to this Section 8.3(b)
shall be treated in accordance with Section 8.5. The Buyer shall not dispose of
such records during the five-year period commencing with the Closing without the
Seller's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Following the expiration of such

-41-
<PAGE>

five-year period, the Buyer may dispose of such records at any time following 90
days' prior written notice to the Seller. During such 90-day period, the Seller
shall have the right, at the Seller's sole expense, to take possession of all or
any part of such records at a time to be agreed upon by the Seller and the
Buyer.

8.4. Renewals and Assignments of Franchise Agreements. From and
------------------------------------------------ 
after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause each Franchisee renewing or assigning a
Franchise Agreement to enter into a new franchise agreement with the Buyer and
to release the Seller from its obligations thereunder as a condition to such
renewal or assignment.

8.5. Confidentiality Matters. (a) At the Closing, the Seller shall
----------------------- 
assign to the Buyer all of the Seller's right, title and interest in any
confidentiality agreements to the extent such agreements pertain to the sale of
the Subject Business entered into by the Seller in connection with the sale of
the Subject Business and, if available, shall deliver to the Buyer the executed
originals of such agreements. The Seller shall not amend, modify or supplement,
or grant any consent or waiver under or with respect to, any of such
confidentiality agreements without the Buyer's prior written consent.

(b) From and after the Closing, each of the Buyer and the Seller
shall maintain the confidentiality of all confidential or proprietary
information of the other party, including marketing, advertising and promotional
methods, agreements with vendors, manufacturers, distributors and other
suppliers, Franchise Agreements, Datago Agreements, customer lists, pricing
policies, financial information, sales volume, inventory procedures and amounts,
logistic systems, computer programs (including source code and object code),
ideas, concepts, processes, research and development and other information
related to the business or customers of such other party (collectively,
"Confidential Information"). Neither party will use (except in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), transfer, release,
publish or disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information of the
other party, without such other party's prior written consent, except as
required by law. Confidential Information does not include any information that
(i) becomes generally known or available to the public, through no fault of such
party, (ii) was known by such party, without any obligation of confidentiality,
prior to the date hereof or (iii) is lawfully obtained by such party after the
date hereof from a third party not bound by any obligation of confidentiality to
the other party. Each party understands that the other party will not have an
adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened breach by such party of the
terms of this Section and therefore agrees that in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, the other party may obtain an injunction or

-42-
<PAGE>

restraining order to enjoin such breach or threatened breach, in addition to any
other available remedy.

8.6. Sale of Certain Notes and Equity - Right of First Offer. In the
------------------------------------------------------- 
event the Seller desires to sell any of its right and interest in and to the
notes receivable set forth on Schedule 3.1(f) or the equity interests set forth
--------------- 
on Schedule 3.1(e) (collectively, the "Investments") at any time during the one-
--------------- 
year period following the Closing Date, the Seller shall first offer to sell any
such Investment to the Buyer pursuant to a written notice (the "Offer Notice")
setting forth the proposed purchase price for such Investment and all other
material terms relating to such sale. The Buyer shall have the right to accept
such offer by providing written notice (a "Notice of Acceptance") of its
acceptance thereof to the Seller at any time within 15 days following the
Buyer's receipt of the Offer Notice. The closing of the purchase and sale of
any Investment to the Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall occur within 30
days of the Buyer's delivery to the Seller of a Notice of Acceptance on the
terms set forth in the Offer Notice. If the Buyer does not deliver a Notice of
Acceptance to the Seller within the aforementioned 15-day period, the Seller
shall have the right to sell such offered Investment to any party within the
six-month period following the Seller's delivery to the Buyer of the Offer
Notice upon terms no less favorable to another buyer than those set forth in the
Offer Notice delivered to the Buyer. In the event such sale is not consummated
within such six-month period or if the purchase price or other material terms of
such proposed sale are more favorable than those set forth in the Offer Notice,
the offered Investment shall again be offered to the Buyer pursuant to this
Section 8.6 if the one-year first offer period has not expired. The parties
shall use their best efforts and act in good faith in order to carry out the
intent of this Section 8.6, and shall enter into such agreements and execute
such instruments of transfer as shall be necessary and appropriate to effect the
sale, if any, contemplated by the provisions of this Section 8.6. Nothing
contained in this Section 8.6 shall prevent the Seller from amending or waiving
any provision of the Investments or any agreement or instrument relating to the
Seller's rights under the Investments.

8.7. Change of Name. The Seller shall change its corporate name to a
-------------- 
name which does not include "ComputerLand", "Datago" or any name similar thereto
by filing an amendment to the Seller's Restated Certificate of Incorporation
with the Delaware Secretary of State within 90 days after the Closing.

8.8. Vendor Consents. After the Closing, at the written request of
---------------- 
the Buyer, the Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer and work in good faith with
the Buyer to obtain the consents of the vendors and Datago Purchasers
contemplated by Schedule 3.1(b) identified in writing by the Buyer and which
--------------- 
were not obtained on or prior to the Closing; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 

-43-
<PAGE>

neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall be required to incur any obligations or
liabilities in obtaining any such consent, except for ordinary and necessary
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith, which expenses shall be
borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller.

8.9. No Solicitation of Employees. Except as provided in Article X,
---------------------------- 
from the date hereof through December 31, 1995, neither the Buyer nor the Seller
shall solicit the employees of the other or any other person who was employed by
the other within six months of his or her termination of such employment.

8.10. Financial Statements. After the Closing, at the written
-------------------- 
request of the Buyer, and at the Buyer's expense, the Seller shall cooperate
with the Buyer and its accountants to prepare, modify or provide additional
information with respect to any financial statements or schedules relating to
the Subject Business.

[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

ARTICLE X

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

10.1. Obligations of Buyer. Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer
-------------------- 
shall extend offers of employment to all employees of the Seller employed in
conducting the Subject Business immediately prior to the Closing on general
terms of employment, including base salary, commission, bonus, benefits and
similar arrangements, substantially comparable to those under which such
employees were employed by the Seller immediately prior to the Closing on an
aggregate basis (recognizing that individual differences in specific terms of
employment may exist), except for one employee of the Subject Business on leave
on the Closing Date, to whom the Buyer shall offer such employment upon return
from such leave. The Buyer shall reimburse the Seller promptly upon written
demand for any payroll amounts paid by the Seller to any employee of the Subject
Business who shall accept the Buyer's offer with respect to any period after the
date hereof. The Buyer shall credit the employees employed in conducting the
Subject Business who shall accept the Buyer's offer with the full length of
their period of service with the Seller for purposes of determining their
eligibility to participate in, and the calculation of benefits under, the
employee benefit plans of the Buyer and for purposes of calculating severance
obligations of the Buyer to such employees; provided, however, that for purposes
-------- ------- 
of calculating the eligibility of employees of the Subject Business to
participate in the 401(k) plan maintained by the Merisel Group,

-44-
<PAGE>

no employee of the Subject Business shall be credited with more than five years
of service upon being hired by the Buyer. In connection therewith, the Buyer
shall be responsible for and shall pay all claims for severance made by the
employees employed in conducting the Subject Business who shall accept the
Buyer's offer and shall be responsible for accrued and unpaid vacation of such
employees to the extent of the amount of the payment for such accrued and unpaid
vacation received from the Seller pursuant to Section 10.2(b). The Buyer shall
be responsible for all benefit claims of the employees employed in conducting
the Subject Business who shall accept the Buyer's offer arising after the
Closing relating to periods after to the Closing, including severance payments,
COBRA coverage, workmen's compensation, unemployment compensation and other
government mandated benefits. The Buyer acknowledges that the Seller makes no
representation that any of its employees will accept the Buyer's offer of
employment. The Buyer shall have no liability with respect to the employment or
termination of employment of any of the Seller's employees who do not accept the
Buyer's offer of employment so long as such employees are not successful in
asserting that their employment by the Seller had been constructively terminated
solely by virtue of the offer of employment made by the Buyer. The Buyer
represents and warrants to the Seller that employees of the Merisel Group who
are attributed with at least five years of service by the Merisel Group shall be
fully vested under the 401(k) plan maintained by the Merisel Group.

10.2. Obligations of Seller. The Seller shall (a) deliver to the
--------------------- 
Buyer no later than three days prior to the Closing a list of all employees of
the Seller then employed in conducting the Subject Business, (b) deliver to the
Buyer within 30 days after the Closing Date a check in an amount which shall
represent the Seller's calculation of all accrued and unpaid vacation pay on or

conditions set forth herein, Seller shall sell to Buyer products ordered by
Customers pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof and shall provide Buyer with the
Logistics Services, in each case as described in this Article II.

(b) All products sold hereunder are sold by Seller to Buyer, and title
and risk of loss shall pass from Seller to Buyer, F.O.B. Seller's point of

2.2. Order Procedures. (a) During the Distribution Period, Seller

shall make CAPS available to Buyer as provided in this Section 2.2, for use in
connection with the Subject Business. CAPS shall be available on an on-line and
dial-up basis, in substantially the manner that it is currently available to
Customers and to Seller's personnel engaged in the Subject Business. Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause CAPS to be available each
Business Day from 5:00 a.m. Pacific time to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time (or such
other hours as Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree); provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
Seller shall not be responsible for any downtime caused by Buyer or by the
Mainframe Team acting on Buyer's behalf.

(b) During the Distribution Period, Buyer shall administer the "front-
end" and user interface to CAPS and shall be responsible for controlling all
access thereto by Customers, Floor Planners and Buyer personnel employed in
connection with the Subject Business (including the issuance of log-in names,
user passwords and dial-in telephone numbers), in each case in accordance with
Seller's usual policies and procedures relating thereto, as in effect on the
Closing Date, or such other policies and procedures as Buyer and Seller shall
hereafter mutually agree in writing. During the Distribution Period, Buyer
shall also be responsible for managing the "credit hold" function of CAMBAR,
including all procedures with Floor Planners to establish and update credit
limits and all other Customer "flags". Any order entered into CAPS that remains
subject to a credit hold, or is otherwise suspended by Buyer for any reason
other a back-order, for 72 consecutive hours (excluding any day that is not a
Business Day or any portion of any such day), shall automatically be canceled.

(c) Seller shall maintain and update from time to time as
provided in Section 2.3 a list of products that may be

-20-
<PAGE>

purchased by Buyer hereunder (the "Inventory List") and shall make such list
available to Customers through CAPS. Seller, acting on Buyer's behalf, shall
receive orders through CAPS for products shown on the Inventory List, as in
effect from time to time, from any Customer in the Designated Territory. Seller
shall not be required to accept or otherwise process any order that has not been
properly entered into CAPS, either by the Customer making such order or by Buyer
on behalf of such Customer. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Inventory List shall not be deemed to include any products
reflected thereon that are identified as "Status Four" products, as defined in
Schedule 2.22(b).

(d) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
Customers to comply with Seller's ordering procedures with respect to the
Subject Business, as in effect on the Closing Date, or such other ordering
procedures for the Subject Business as Buyer and Seller shall hereafter mutually
agree in writing, including all such procedures relating to the proper use and
operation of CAPS. Buyer shall not enter into CAPS any order that is not a bona
----
fide order by a Customer and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to insure
- - - ---- 
that no "end-user" of products sold by Seller hereunder (excluding for this
purpose any [*] company, [*] company, [*] of microcomputer products or [*])
obtains access to CAPS as a Customer; provided, however, that the foregoing
-------- ------- 
shall not apply to any order uploaded to CAPS through POET or any similar
"front-end" to CAPS made available during the Distribution Period to the end-
user customers of any Franchisee. Seller shall not be responsible for any delay
in or failure to fill any order caused by (i) the failure of Buyer or any
Customer to comply with the ordering procedures provided for in this Section 2.2
or (ii) any error or interruption in the operation of CAPS or CAMBAR caused by
any employee or agent of Buyer.

(e) Seller shall process all orders properly entered into CAPS in
accordance with Seller's usual electronic order processing systems and
procedures, including as of the date hereof the electronic order processing and
order-interruption functions of CAMBAR ("Seller's Order Processing System").
Any order interrupted by Seller's Order Processing System as a result of any
credit hold imposed by Buyer or any Floor Planner shall be automatically
suspended until (i) such order is deleted by Buyer or the Customer making such
order, (ii) the Floor Planner responsible for such credit hold increases the
credit limit of such Customer in an amount sufficient to fund such order or
(iii) Buyer, in its sole discretion, overrides any such credit hold in
accordance with such procedures as Buyer and Seller shall hereafter mutually
agree in writing. Seller shall not be
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-21-
<PAGE>

responsible for any loss, claim, liability or expense arising in connection with
the imposition or release of any credit limit or credit hold with respect to any
Customer by Buyer or any Floor Planner, except to the extent that any such loss,
claim, liability or expense shall have resulted from the negligence or wilful
misconduct of Seller.

(f) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Seller
shall not be obligated to accept or otherwise process any order from any
Customer or sell any product to Buyer hereunder, if the sale by Seller to Buyer
or by Buyer to such Customer of any product so ordered would violate any
dealership, distributorship or similar agreement between Buyer, Seller or such
Customer and any vendor, manufacturer or distributor.

(g) During the Distribution Period, Seller shall not modify in any
material respect either the functioning or the "look and feel" of CAPS, as in
effect on the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed), unless Buyer requests
such change or implements such change through the Mainframe Team; provided,
-------- 
however, that if (i) Seller notifies Buyer of its intent to make any
- - - ------- 
modification of or replacement to CAPS at least 60 days prior to the proposed
implementation thereof and provides Buyer with such information as it reasonably
requests regarding the design, operation and cost to Buyer of the system as
proposed to be modified or replaced, (ii) such modified or replacement system
performs at least as favorably in all material respects as the then-existing
system, as determined by Buyer in its reasonable judgment, and (iii) Seller
reimburses Buyer and any affected Customers for all costs incurred by them in
order to modify their systems and train their personnel to accommodate and
properly utilize such modified or replacement system, to the same degree that
Buyer and such Customers used such system as in effect at the time such
modification or replacement is proposed, then Buyer's consent shall not be
withheld or delayed. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
Seller may make (but shall not be required to make) such changes to CAPS as
shall be commercially reasonable to preserve the confidentiality of any
information relating solely to the Retained Business or solely to the Subject
Business, as applicable, provided that such changes do not impair any function
of CAPS relating in whole or in part to the Subject Business.

(h) Neither party shall enter into CAPS, and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any Customers from entering into
CAPS, any order for an "inhibitor" or other invalid SKU, or any order for any
other SKU that the person entering the order should reasonably be expected to
know will not allocate, for the purpose, in whole or material part, of holding
inventory.

2.3. Seller's Inventory List; Relationships with Vendors. (a) A
--------------------------------------------------- 
copy of the Inventory List, as in effect on the Closing Date, is attached hereto
as Schedule 2.3(a). Except as provided in Section 2.3(b), Seller may from time
to time add and/or remove any products and/or vendors to or from the Inventory
List, as Seller in its sole discretion shall from time to time deem appropriate.
Seller shall give Buyer at least 5 days prior written notice before removing any
product from the Inventory List and shall give Buyer at least 30 days prior
written notice before removing any vendor from the Inventory List; provided,
-------- 
however, that Seller may remove from the Inventory List, without prior notice,
- - - ------- 
any product discontinued by the vendor of such product, so long as Seller gives
Buyer written notice of any such action as soon as practicable after Seller
receives notice thereof from the vendor. Seller shall update the Inventory List
from time to time by electronic mail, as needed, and shall provide to Buyer on a
monthly basis, the product, price and other data included in the Inventory List,
in such form as Buyer may reasonably request to permit Buyer to produce a price
book or similar publication.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 2.3(a), but subject to Sections 2.3(c),
(d) and (e), at all times during the Distribution Period, Seller shall include
on the Inventory List the products of each of the vendors set forth on Schedule
2.3(b), as such Schedule shall be modified from time to time pursuant to this
Section 2.3(b) (the "Vendor List"). The Vendor List may be modified only as
follows:

(i) Buyer may request the addition of a vendor to the Vendor
List at any time, by written notice to Seller, if, after giving effect to
such addition, the Vendor List would include no more than [*] vendors. As
soon as practicable after receipt of any such request, Seller will commence
negotiating in good faith with such vendor with a view to establishing a
purchasing relationship with such vendor, including negotiation of a
distribution, volume purchase agreement or similar agreement between Seller
and such vendor on customary terms and conditions. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such an agreement with such
vendor within 30 days after receipt of Buyer's notice requesting the
addition of such vendor, or as soon thereafter as shall be practicable
under the circumstances.

(ii) Seller may delete a vendor from the Vendor List at any time,
upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Buyer (a "Deletion
Notice"), if the aggregate gross sales through the Subject Business of all
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-23-
<PAGE>

such vendor's products during any two or more of the preceding three
quarters is less than $250,000 per quarter; provided, however, that if
-------- ------- 
Buyer notifies Seller in writing within 10 days after receiving any
Deletion Notice that Buyer objects to the deletion of such vendor from the
Vendor List, then such vendor shall not be so deleted from the Vendor List,
and Seller shall not deliver any further Deletion Notice with respect to
such vendor for at least 12 months from the date of Buyer's objection;

provided further, however, that Buyer shall not be entitled to object to
---------------- ------- 
the deletion of more than five vendors pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)(ii)
in any 12-month period during the term of the Agreement.

(iii) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
Seller may delete any vendor from the Vendor List at any time, upon such
prior written notice to Buyer as shall be reasonable under the
circumstances (or refuse to add any vendor designated by Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.3(b)(i)), if an ordinarily prudent person in the business of
Seller could reasonably believe that, in light of the creditworthiness of
such vendor, it was imprudent to carry the products of such vendor in
inventory, under the circumstances contemplated by this Agreement, the
terms and conditions set forth herein and the terms and conditions offered
by such vendor.

(iv) Buyer may delete a vendor from the Vendor List at any time,
upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to Seller, if Seller has
deleted, or has given Buyer written notice that it intends to delete, from
the Inventory List a material portion of the products of such vendor
pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and/or Section 2.3(d), and the number of
products of such vendor remaining on the Inventory List and/or the volumes
of such products sold by Seller to Buyer hereunder do not, in Buyer's good
faith and commercially reasonable judgment, warrant maintaining such vendor
on the Vendor List.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 2.3(b), Seller may delete from the
Inventory List at any time, upon not less than 5 days prior written notice to
Buyer, any product of any vendor if fewer than 20 units of such product were
sold through the Subject Business in any of the three months immediately
preceding the date of such notice.

(d) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Seller
may delete from the Inventory List at any time, on such prior written notice to
Buyer as shall be reasonable under the circumstances, any product of any vendor,
if (i) Seller is prohibited from selling such product to Buyer for resale to
Customers as provided herein, pursuant to any agreement of the type described in
Section 2.2(f) to which Seller may be

-24-
<PAGE>

subject; or (ii) such product is not available to Seller for sale to Buyer
hereunder, except on terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, materially
less favorable to Seller than the terms and conditions normally obtained by
Seller from its vendors for similar products;

(e) Except as provided in Section 2.3(d), at all times during the
Distribution Period, Seller shall include on the Inventory List any product that
Seller generally makes available for purchase by the end-user customers of the
Retained Business, other than (i) spare parts, (ii) any products that are
generally sold by Seller only in conjunction with the performance of any service
contract or other service offered by Seller through the Retained Business, (iii)
any products of any Special Order Vendor, and (iv) [*]. Notwithstanding clause
(iv) of the preceding sentence, if Buyer desires to purchase [*] from Seller,
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate with each other in good faith regarding the
terms and conditions of any such purchase, which accordingly shall not, unless
otherwise agreed, be subject to any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

(f) Without limiting the rights of Seller pursuant to this Section
2.3, during the Distribution Period, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in good
faith with respect to the composition of the Inventory List from time to time
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to include therein any product
reasonably requested by Buyer, whether or not the vendor of such product is on
the Vendor List, provided that (i) Buyer demonstrates to Seller that there is
sufficient demand on the part of a broad base of Customers to warrant stocking
such product, or that stocking such product is necessary for strategic or
competitive reasons, and (ii) such product is available to Seller for resale to
Buyer hereunder on terms and conditions that are not, in the aggregate,
materially less favorable to Seller than the terms and conditions normally
obtained by Seller from its vendors for similar products.

(g) It is the intention of the parties to cooperate with one another
in good faith in connection with all dealings between either party and any
vendor relating to the Subject Business, including any such dealings regarding
Marketing Development Funds, Co-op Funds, Price Protection, Prompt Payment
Discounts, [*] of [*] inventory and similar issues relating thereto. In that
connection, each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to inform
the other party regarding any significant meetings, telephone conversations,
correspondence and other contacts with vendors and (ii) in the case of any such
meetings for which such party has reasonable advance notice and which are
expected to cover issues that an ordinarily prudent
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-25-
<PAGE>

person would consider important under the circumstances, to permit a
representative of the other party to participate therein. Each party shall
permit the other party, upon reasonable request, with reasonable notice during
normal business hours, to review and copy all agreements and correspondence with
vendors relating to the Subject Business; provided, however, that any out-of-
-------- ------- 
pocket expenses relating to such review and/or copying shall be borne by the
reviewing party. Each party hereby authorizes the other party to contact
directly any vendor of such party in connection with any matter relating to the
Subject Business, and each party shall upon the request of the other party or
any vendor confirm such authorization in writing. Neither party shall at any
time seek to influence any vendor to take any action with respect to the other
party that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon
such other party, except as otherwise required or permitted by any provision of
this Agreement.

(h) Within 30 days after the end of each month during the
Distribution Period, Seller shall provide Buyer with (i) a report showing Gross
Sales for such month, and, on a monthly basis, for the year to date, including a
break-down by Customer and by vendor and (ii) a report showing the gross sales
of the Retained Business for such month, and, on a monthly basis, for the year
to date, including a breakdown by vendor (but not by Customer). Copies of such
reports for the month ended December 31, 1993, are attached hereto as Schedule
2.3(h).

(i) During the Distribution Period, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to announce price changes, "new product adds" and "ETAs" by
electronic mail or comparable means within 24 hours after Seller receives
knowledge thereof (not including any day that is not a Business Day, or any
portion of any such day).

(j) During the Distribution Period, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain an electronic database of product descriptions,
accessible to Buyer and Customers through CAPS, for all material products on the
Inventory List from time to time. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all product descriptions included in such database to be
accurate in all material respects as of the date included, and to update such
database at reasonable intervals; provided, however, that Seller shall not be
-------- ------- 
liable to Buyer, any Customer or any other person for any loss, claim, liability
or expense arising in connection with such database or any error therein or
omission therefrom, except to the extent that any such loss, claim, liability or
expense shall have resulted from the negligence or willful misconduct of Seller.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall not in any event
be liable to Buyer, any Customer or any other person for any loss, claim,
liability or expense arising in

-26-
<PAGE>

connection with any error or omission caused by Buyer, any vendor or any third
party provider of any such product descriptions.

(k) Without limiting Seller's obligation pursuant to Section 2.3(j),
so long as Merisel or any subsidiary or affiliate shall compile any product
descriptions in connection with any other business or proposed business of
Merisel and its subsidiaries and affiliates in the Designated Territory, Buyer
shall provide to Seller upon request a copy of any product descriptions so
compiled relating to any products on the Inventory List, for an aggregate
monthly fee of [*] per month, until such time as Merisel or any such subsidiary
or affiliate shall be engaged in the business of providing product descriptions
generally to third parties in the Designated Territory. If, during the
Distribution Period, Merisel or any such subsidiary or affiliate shall be
engaged in the business of providing product descriptions to third parties in
the Designated Territory, Buyer shall cause Merisel or such subsidiary or
affiliate, within 30 days after commencing to engage in such business, to enter
into a written agreement to supply Seller with all or substantially all product
descriptions required to maintain the database contemplated by Section 2.3(j),
for a total cost to Seller not to exceed [*] per month and otherwise on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Merisel (or such subsidiary or affiliate).

2.4. Purchase Price to Buyer. (a) Subject to Section 2.4(b), the
----------------------- 
purchase price payable by Buyer to Seller for any product purchased by Buyer
from Seller hereunder (the "Buyer Purchase Price") shall be the [*] of such
product.

(b) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the
event that Seller (i) directly or indirectly develops, designs, produces or
assembles from components any product or (ii) sells any Private Label Product to
Buyer hereunder, then Seller and Buyer shall work together in good faith to
establish a mutually agreeable adjustment to the definition of "Buyer Purchase
Price" for such products hereunder.

2.5. Payment for Products Shipped Hereunder. (a) Subject to Section
-------------------------------------- 
2.34, Buyer shall pay to Seller in accordance with this Section 2.5, on or
before the second Business Day following the Invoice Date therefor, an amount
equal to the Buyer Purchase Price for each product shipped by Seller hereunder.
All such amounts shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, subject to the netting arrangement provided for in Section 2.8(b). Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to initiate all such wire transfers no
later than 9:00 a.m. Pacific time, on the date due, and to notify
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-27-
<PAGE>

Seller by telephone of all such wire transfers (including the amount, wiring
institution, time initiated and Federal reference number, if available) as soon
as practicable after each such wire transfer has been initiated.

(b) Subject to Section 2.34, Buyer shall pay interest to Seller on any
amounts not paid when due under this Section 2.5, from the date due until the
date actually paid, at a variable rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus 2%
per annum. Such interest shall be due and payable monthly in arrears pursuant
to Section 2.10.

(c) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Seller
may suspend all sales to Buyer under this Agreement, and all shipments to
Customers on Buyer's behalf hereunder, if Buyer fails to pay to Seller the Buyer
Purchase Price for any products shipped by Seller hereunder, or any other amount
due (including on any extended due date as provided in Section 2.34) to Seller
under this Agreement, within three Business Days after the receipt of notice
from Seller stating the amount past due; provided, however, that, subject to
-------- ------- 
Section 2.5(d), if Buyer in good faith disputes that it is obligated to pay all
or any portion of any amount claimed by Seller hereunder, and Buyer has paid
each amount not disputed in good faith to Seller not later than three Business
Days after the receipt of the notice referred to in this sentence applicable to
such amount, and (if the aggregate of all amounts in dispute exceeds $1,000,000)
has paid all disputed amounts into escrow pursuant to Section 2.26, then,
pending resolution of such dispute pursuant to Article VIII hereof (whether
pursuant to negotiation, mediation or litigation), Seller shall not suspend any
sales and/or shipments pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) by reason of Buyer's
failure to pay such disputed amounts to Seller. During any period of such
suspension of sales and shipments, the Performance Standards shall also be
suspended. Without prejudice to the rights of Seller to suspend sales to Buyer
and shipments to Customers as provided in this Section 2.5(c), any dispute
regarding the obligation of Buyer to make any payment to Seller hereunder shall
be submitted for resolution pursuant to Article VIII hereof; provided, however,
-------- ------- 
that if the aggregate of all amounts in dispute is in excess of $1,000,000, the
expedited procedures of Section 8.3 shall apply. Following any suspension of
sales to Buyer and shipments to Customers for nonpayment as provided in this
Section 2.5(c), Seller may, as a condition to resuming such sales and shipments,
require that Buyer provide adequate assurance that future amounts due to Seller
hereunder will be paid when due.

(d) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Buyer
shall not dispute its obligation to pay the Buyer Purchase Price or Outbound
Freight for any product shipped by Seller hereunder unless Buyer in good faith
disputes that such product was in fact shipped to the Customer ordering

-28-
<PAGE>

such product (or to such Customer's customer) and specifies in writing the
product or shipment in dispute (the "Disputed Shipment"), with sufficient
information for Seller to verify the same. Buyer may set off against the Buyer
Purchase Price and/or Outbound Freight payable in respect of any product shipped
by Seller hereunder any amount theretofore actually paid by Buyer in respect of
a Disputed Shipment, but shall not otherwise have the right to set off any
amount whatsoever against the Buyer Purchase Price and/or Outbound Freight for
any product shipped by Seller hereunder. Any amount set off by Buyer pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall constitute an amount disputed in good faith by
Buyer for all purposes of Section 2.5(c) and Section 2.26.

2.6. Payment by Customers. (a) The price payable by any Customer
-------------------- 
for any product purchased from Buyer and shipped by Seller, on Buyer's behalf,
to such Customer hereunder (the "Customer Purchase Price") shall be determined
by Buyer. Buyer shall have sole responsibility for inputting into CAPS and/or
CAMBAR all pricing terms, mark-ups and other pricing information relating to
Buyer's sales to Customers, including information regarding any [*] to be billed
to Customers hereunder and any applicable sales and use tax charges to the
Customer, as determined by Buyer ("Buyer Pricing Information"), prior to the
effectiveness thereof. All Buyer Pricing Information and any changes therein
shall not be effective (as between Buyer and Seller) unless and until properly
inputted into CAPS and/or CAMBAR. For purposes of preparing any invoice
pursuant to Section 2.8, Seller shall be entitled to rely on the Buyer Pricing
Information last inputted by Buyer into CAPS and/or CAMBAR prior to the time
that such order becomes a confirmed order. To the extent that any Buyer Pricing
Information shall provide for the Customer Purchase Price of any product to be
based on a factor identified as "inventory cost", such factor shall be equal to
the [*] of such product as defined herein.

(b) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and take all reasonable actions
requested by Buyer to notify Customers that amounts invoiced to Customers
hereunder and Royalties due from Customers for periods following the Closing
shall be payable to the account of and in the manner directed by Buyer. Seller
shall promptly forward to Buyer all payments received by Seller with respect to
such amounts, together with such endorsements or assignments as shall be
necessary for the transfer thereof to Buyer. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller in connection with any
such actions.

(c) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Buyer's
obligation to pay all amounts due to
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-29-
<PAGE>

Seller hereunder shall not be affected by any default by any Customer or floor
planner, or any bankruptcy or other event by any Customer or floor planner that
enjoins or otherwise prohibits any payment by any Customer or floor planner to
Buyer or makes any such payment recoverable from Buyer.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.6(a), Seller shall be responsible for
inputting into CAPS and/or CAMBAR the correct Inventory Cost and Buyer Purchase
Price of each product on the Inventory List. In the event that the Inventory
Cost or Buyer Purchase Price of any product, as inputted into CAPS and/or
CAMBAR, exceeds the actual Inventory Cost or Buyer Purchase Price, as
applicable, of such product, and as a result thereof Buyer pays to Seller, in
respect of such product, an amount in excess of the Buyer Purchase Price for
such product, Seller shall promptly refund to Buyer the full amount of such
excess. In the event that the Buyer Purchase Price or Inventory Cost of any
product, as inputted into CAPS and/or CAMBAR, is less than the actual [*] or
[*], as applicable, of such product, and as a result thereof Buyer pays to
Seller, in respect of such product, an amount less than the [*] therefor, the
following procedure shall apply:

(i) If the Customer Purchase Price actually billed to any
Customer in respect of such product shall have been based on the correct
Buyer Purchase Price for such product, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller
the amount of the actual Buyer Purchase Price for such product, less any
amount theretofore paid by Buyer to Seller in respect thereof.

(ii) If the Customer Purchase Price actually billed to any
Customer in respect of such product shall not have been based on the
correct Buyer Purchase Price for such product, Seller shall prepare and
(subject to the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld or delayed) send to such Customer a debit memo for the deficiency,
showing the correct Buyer Purchase Price and the Customer Purchase Price
payable in respect thereof, and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with one
another in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to collect
from such Customer the additional amount owed by such Customer to Buyer in
respect of such product, as shown on such debit memo; provided, however,
-------- -------
that payment of such additional amount shall not result in undue hardship
to such Customer. Buyer shall pay to Seller a percentage of any additional
amounts recovered by Buyer from such Customer in respect of such product
equal to the percentage that the Buyer Purchase Price of such product bears
to the Customer Purchase Price for such product, in each case as corrected
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-30-
<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section 2.6(b)(ii), but Buyer shall not otherwise have any
liability to Seller in respect of the difference between the actual
Inventory Cost or Buyer Purchase Price of such product and the Inventory
Cost or Buyer Purchase Price, as applicable, used to determine the Customer
Purchase Price originally billed to such Customer.

(e) Buyer shall cooperate with Seller and take all reasonable actions
requested by Seller to notify Customers as applicable that (i) any amounts
invoiced by Seller to any customer of a Customer under the MASTER program and
(ii) any Royalties due from Customers for periods prior to the Closing Date,
shall in each case be payable to the account of and in the manner directed by
Seller. Buyer shall promptly forward to Seller all payments received by Buyer
with respect to such amounts, together with such endorsements or assignments as
shall be necessary for the transfer thereof to Seller. Seller shall reimburse
Buyer for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in connection
with any such actions.

2.7. Shipping and Delivery; Freight Charges. (a) Seller, acting as
-------------------------------------- 
an independent contractor on behalf of Buyer hereunder, shall ship products
directly to any Customer (or to any customer of a Customer) within a
commercially reasonable time after receipt of a Confirmed Order from such
Customer, provided that at the time such order is entered into CAPS (or, in the
case of any order that is subject to credit hold in accordance with Section
2.2(e), at the time such credit hold is released by Buyer or the applicable
Floor Planner pursuant to Section 2.2(e)(ii) or 2.2(e)(iii)) sufficient units of
such products are in Seller's stock and, if subject to allocation due to limited
supply, are allocated to Buyer.

(b) Seller shall not be required to ship any products for delivery to
any location outside of the Designated Territory. All products shipped by
Seller, on Buyer's behalf, to any Customer hereunder shall be shipped from the
Primary Distribution Center for such Customer, except as provided in Section
2.7(c). Interstate shipments shall be shipped by Federal Express (or another
nationally-recognized air courier), second day air, except as otherwise provided
herein. Intrastate shipments in California and Indiana shall be made by local
carrier. If such Customer requests expedited delivery, such products shall be
shipped by Federal Express (or another nationally-recognized air courier, or
local carrier for intrastate shipments), for delivery the next Business Day
("Expedited Delivery"). Except as otherwise specifically provided by this
Section 2.7(b), as permitted by Section 2.21(b), or as Buyer and Seller may
otherwise mutually agree, Seller shall

-31-
<PAGE>

comply during the Distribution Period with its usual shipping policies and
procedures in effect as of the Closing Date, including such policies and
procedures relating to split shipments and back-orders, all as more particularly
described in Schedule 2.7(b).

(c) If, at the time that Seller receives a Confirmed Order from any
Customer for any product on the Inventory List, the Primary Distribution Center
for such Customer is out-of-stock in such product, then such order shall
automatically be filled from [*] the [*] for such Customer or the [*] for such
Customer, whichever is first able to fill such order (subject to Section
2.22(b), if applicable). Except as provided in this Section 2.7(c), Seller
shall not be required to ship any product to any Customer (or to any customer of
a Customer) from the [*] for such Customer, or to permit any Customer to order
any product from such Customer's [*], if its Primary Distribution Center has
such product in stock at the time such order is entered into CAPS; however,
------- 
Seller shall endeavor to ship products ordered by any Customer for delivery to
such Customer's customer from the distribution center closest to such customer.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, following the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with one another in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner to develop a modification to CAPS that will
permit any order for any product received from any "smaller Customer" (as such
term shall be defined by Buyer in good faith in connection with the development
of such modification) to be held by CAMBAR for up to two Business Days before
being filled from such Customer's [*], if such Customer's [*] is [*] in such
product at the time such order is received.

(d) Buyer shall pay to Seller pursuant to Section 2.10, for each month
during the Distribution Period, (i) Outbound Freight for such month, less (ii)
---- 
[*] of the ABF Differential for such month. For purposes of such payment, the
ABF Differential shall be determined as follows:

(A) in the second and third months in each quarter, Seller shall
estimate the ABF Differential for the preceding month by multiplying
Outbound Freight for such month by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the ABF Differential for the preceding quarter (as certified by Seller
pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii)(8)) and the denominator of which shall be
Outbound Freight for such preceding quarter; and
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-32-
<PAGE>

(B) in the first month in each quarter, Seller shall determine
the actual ABF Differential for the preceding quarter.

(e) Buyer shall also pay to Seller, pursuant to Section 2.10:

(i) the aggregate amount of all [*] charged to Seller by Seller's
vendor for any product sold to Buyer by Seller hereunder, to the extent not
included in Inventory Cost for such product ("[*]"); and

(ii) the aggregate amount of all [*] ([*]) incurred directly or
indirectly by Seller in respect of any products sold by Seller to Buyer
hereunder ("[*]").

Inbound Freight and Insurance shall be estimated and allocated between Buyer and
Seller in accordance with Seller's usual policies and procedures relating
thereto, as set forth in Schedule 2.7(e); provided, however, that if, as a
-------- ------- 
result of circumstances beyond the power of Seller to reasonably control, there
is a material change in the way that Seller pays, or is required to account, for
Inbound Freight or Insurance, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with one another
in good faith to revise or replace any or all of such policies and procedures,
as shall be reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes and intent of this
Section 2.7(e); provided further, however, that such policies and procedures
---------------- ------- 
shall in the aggregate be designed to provide that, on the whole, Seller shall
neither recognize a profit nor incur a loss in respect of [*] or [*], as
determined in accordance with GAAP. Seller shall give Buyer such notice of any
circumstances of the type contemplated by the preceding sentence as shall under
such circumstances be commercially reasonable. Following the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other in good faith to consider the
feasibility of developing a system that would enable individual Customers to [*]
of the insurance coverage provided by Seller hereunder for outbound deliveries,
and, if Buyer and Seller determine that development of such a system would be
feasible and in the best interests of the Subject Business, and would not impose
any additional costs upon Seller (other than such costs as, in the aggregate,
are de minimis), Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
-- ------- 
develop such a system.

2.8. Invoices; Confirmations to Floor Planners. (a) Seller, on
----------------------------------------- 
Buyer's behalf, shall prepare and send to each Customer to which products are
shipped hereunder, an invoice,

may from time to time agree in writing, showing the name of such Customer, the
date of the shipment, a brief description of the products shipped, and the
Customer Purchase Price for each product shipped (the "Customer Invoice"). Each
Customer Invoice shall reflect such sale as being made by Buyer to such Customer
and shall provide for payment to be made directly to Buyer, or as Buyer shall
otherwise instruct. Seller shall send each Customer Invoice by electronic mail
to the Customer named therein not later than one Business Day after the date of
shipment and shall mail a printed copy of such invoice to such Customer not
later than six Business Days after the date of shipment; provided, however, that
-------- -------

Customer shall receive only the printed copy of such invoice, which shall be
mailed within such six-Business Day period.

(b) Within one Business Day after the date of shipment, Seller shall
send to Buyer an electronic mail copy of the Customer Invoice relating to such
shipment, together with a statement of the Buyer Purchase Price of each product
shipped, and the invoice and statement sent to Buyer together shall constitute
Seller's invoice to Buyer for the sale of such products by Seller to Buyer
hereunder (the "Buyer Invoice"). Seller shall provide to Buyer by 5:00 p.m.,
Pacific time, on each Business Day, a report (the "Daily Net Payment Report")

of Buyer Invoices that will be due and payable on the immediately
succeeding Business Day pursuant to Section 2.5(a);

(ii) the sum of all amounts payable by Seller to Buyer in respect
of Returnable Products and/or Mis-Shipped Products accepted by Seller for
return pursuant to Section 2.12(b), which amounts will be due and payable
on such immediately succeeding Business Day pursuant to Section 2.12(c);

(iii) the arithmetic difference of the amount in clause (i) above

minus the amount in clause (ii) above (the "Daily Net Payment Amount");
----- 

(iv) prior to the Extended Payment Termination Date, the

and

(v) prior to the Extended Payment Termination Date, the amount of
any wire transfer made by Buyer to Seller on such Business Day pursuant to
Section 2.5(a) (to the extent that Buyer shall have given notice of such wire
transfer pursuant to such Section 2.5(a)).

-34-
<PAGE>

If the Daily Net Payment Amount for any Business Day is a positive number, Buyer
shall pay that amount to Seller by the following Business Day pursuant to
Section 2.5(a); provided, however, that prior to the Extended Payment
-------- ------- 
Termination Date, Buyer shall in lieu thereof pay the amount, if positive, equal
to (A) the Additional Receivable Amount outstanding at the beginning of such of
such Business Day, minus (B) the amount of any wire transfer made by Buyer to
----- 
Seller on such Business Day pursuant to Section 2.5(a) (to the extent that Buyer
shall have given notice of such wire transfer pursuant to such Section 2.5(a)),

plus (C) the Daily Net Payment Amount for such Business Day, minus (D)
- - - ---- ----- 
$20,000,000. If the Daily Net Payment Amount for any Business Day is a negative
number, Seller shall pay that amount to Buyer by the following Business Day by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, in accordance with Section
2.12(c). Seller shall provide Buyer, on a monthly basis, with a printed summary
of all transactions completed hereunder, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer. Buyer shall reimburse Seller on a monthly basis for the postage costs of
mailing printed invoices to Customers.

(c) Within one Business Day after the date of each shipment, Seller
shall send to each Floor Planner financing any of the products included in such
shipment an electronic mail copy of the Customer Invoice relating to such
shipment, including such information regarding the products financed by such
Floor Planner as Buyer or such Floor Planner shall reasonably request ("Floor
Planner Invoice").

2.9. Distribution Fee; Advance Payments. (a) Buyer shall pay to
---------------------------------- 
Seller a fee (the "Distribution Fee") in an amount equal to the Monthly
Distribution Fee for each month during the Distribution Period, payable as
provided in Section 2.10.

(b) As an advance on the Net Payment Amount payable by Buyer to Seller
in each month, Buyer shall pay to Seller on the first, second, third and fourth
Tuesday of each month (or if any such day shall not be a Business Day, on the
next succeeding Business Day), an amount equal to [*] of the Rolling Average Net
Payment Amount for such month; provided, however, that if the Rolling Average
-------- ------- 
Net Payment Amount for such month shall not be greater than zero, no payment
shall be made in such month pursuant to this Section 2.9(b). The sum of all
amounts actually paid by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Section 2.9(b) in any
month is referred to herein as the "Advance Payment Amount" for such month.

cost of sales) for the second preceding month, as revised to reflect (i) any
additional information that shall have become available to Buyer for such second
preceding month, and (ii) the inclusion as Royalties for such second preceding

each month, Seller shall

(i) calculate Applicable Revenue for the preceding month, using
the amounts for Royalties and Other Revenue certified by Buyer pursuant to

they are known) plus the Additional Royalty Amount calculated for the
---- 
second preceding month (and any additional Other Revenue certified by Buyer
pursuant to the third sentence of Section 2.10(a)); and

the form of Schedule 2.10(c), the estimated Monthly Distribution Fee for the
preceding month, calculated on the assumption that the Base Percentage for such
quarter will be equal to the Base Percentage for the preceding quarter (or, in
the case of the first quarter hereunder, that the Base Percentage will be [*]).

(d) On the Determination Date in the first month in each quarter,
Seller shall calculate and certify to Buyer, substantially in the form of
Schedule 2.10(d), the actual Base Percentage for the preceding quarter and the
actual Monthly Distribution Fee for the last month in such preceding quarter.
If such actual Base Percentage shall be different from the Base Percentage used
in calculating the Monthly Distribution Fee for the first two months of such
preceding quarter, Seller shall also recalculate and certify the actual Monthly
Distribution Fee for the first two months in such preceding quarter, as well as
the aggregate difference between the actual and estimated fees for

calculate and certify to Buyer, substantially in the form of Schedule 2.10(e)(i)
or Schedule 2.10(e)(ii), as applicable, the "Net Payment Amount", which shall be

---------------------------------------- 
Distribution Period, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other in
connection with all negotiations and other dealings with vendors, manufacturers
and distributors relating to Marketing Development Funds related to products

(b) Except as provided in Section 2.11(f), Seller shall control all
negotiations and other dealings relating to Marketing Development Funds, subject
to the following general principles:

(i) Seller and Buyer shall use their respective best efforts to
maximize the [*] of Marketing Development Funds available to Seller and
Buyer in respect of products acquired by Seller for sale to Buyer
hereunder; provided, however, that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be

obligated to incur any cost or obligation or expend any funds that would

[*] or to convert into [*] any [*] that would otherwise have been [*].

agreements and other arrangements with each applicable vendor, all [*]
allocable to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.11(d) shall be for the benefit of
Buyer, to be used as Buyer and each applicable vendor shall determine.
Buyer shall have the responsibility (with the cooperation of Seller) to
negotiate with vendors regarding the use of such [*]. Seller shall use

- - - -----------

Buyer in completing such forms and procedures, shall deliver the completed
forms and any accompanying documentation provided by Buyer to the

(c) Marketing Development Funds shall be accrued and allocated by
Seller on a separate basis as provided in this Section 2.11 for each MDF program
for which Seller is eligible during the Distribution Period, including but not
limited to programs that commenced prior to the start of the Distribution Period
or that end after the termination or expiration of the Distribution Period.
Seller shall maintain such books and records as Seller and Buyer reasonably
determine to be necessary to account for such accrual and allocation of
Marketing Development Funds and shall provide Buyer with such reports relating
to MDF accrued, Earned, Realized and allocated hereunder as Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably determine. During each quota period for each such [*], Seller
shall accrue an estimated amount of the Marketing Development Funds expected to
be Earned under such MDF program. Such accrual for each MDF program shall be
made based on (i) the actual purchases or sales from time to time during such
period of products to which such MDF program applies (or any other volume levels
or other criteria on the basis of which such MDF are earned under such MDF
program), (ii) the volume bar (or other earning rate) for which Seller would be
eligible based on the good faith projection of Seller and Buyer as to the volume
of such purchases or sales (or other basis of earning MDF under such program)
expected to be achieved during such period and (iii) such other criteria as
Seller and Buyer shall determine in good faith. If the actual amount of such
MDF Earned and/or Realized differs from the estimated amount accrued for any
period, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to reflect such difference
retroactive to the period over which such MDF was accrued.

(d) Marketing Development Funds shall be allocated between Buyer
and Seller as follows:

(i) Marketing Development Funds accrued for any period based on
the purchase by Seller of any product shall be attributed to each unit of
such product so purchased, pro rata in proportion to the Inventory Cost

thereof. The MDF so attributed to any product sold by Seller to Buyer
hereunder shall be allocated to Buyer at the
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-43-
<PAGE>

time of such sale; the MDF attributed to any product sold by Seller to any
person other than Buyer shall be allocated to Seller at the time of such
sale.

(ii) Marketing Development Funds accrued for any period based on
the sale by Seller (whether to Buyer or to any other person) and/or by
Buyer of any product shall be attributed to each unit of such product so
sold, pro rata in proportion to the Inventory Cost thereof. The MDF so
--- ---- 
attributed to any product sold by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be
allocated to Buyer at the time of such sale; the MDF attributed to any
product sold by Seller to any person other than Buyer shall be allocated to
Seller at the time of such sale.

(iii) All other Marketing Development Funds shall be allocated
between Buyer and Seller as such parties shall in good faith mutually
agree, based on the criteria for earning such MDF under the program
established by the applicable vendor.

(iv) At the time of any adjustment to any accrual of Marketing
Development Funds as provided in Section 2.11(c), any allocation previously
made based on such accrual shall also be adjusted to reflect the adjusted
level of such accrual. Any amount of Marketing Development Funds allocated
as provided in this Section 2.11(d) shall not be deemed finally allocated
until (A) such MDF shall have been Earned, (B) in the case of [*], such [*]
shall have been [*] and (C) the sale by Seller of the applicable unit of
product shall have occurred (or any other criteria for allocating such MDF,
as provided in Section 2.11(d)(iii), shall have been satisfied).

(v) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
(A) an MDF credit shall be deemed to have been "Earned" for purposes of
this Agreement at such time as the applicable vendor shall have notified
Seller that such credit has been earned, and (B) an MDF credit shall be
deemed to have been "Realized" for purposes of this Agreement when Seller
shall have received cash, cash equivalents, property or other consideration
from the vendor in respect of such MDF credit; provided, however, that if
-------- ------- 
Seller shall at any time make an accounting entry on its books and records
reflecting the setting-off by Seller of any MDF credit Earned by Seller
from any vendor against Seller's account payable to such vendor, then
Seller shall be deemed to have received cash equivalents in respect of such
MDF credit at the time that Seller would otherwise have
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-44-
<PAGE>

paid the account payable so offset. Notwithstanding the proviso in the
preceding sentence, Seller shall not be required to reflect the setting-off
of any MDF credit Earned by Seller from any vendor prior to the time that
such vendor effects such set off, as reflected on an invoice or other
written communication from such vendor to Seller.

(e) All amounts of Marketing Development Funds Realized by Seller and
allocated to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.11(d) shall be paid by Seller to Buyer,
as provided in this Section 2.11(e), on or before the Settlement Date in the
first month following the month in which such MDF was Realized; provided,
-------- 
however, that if Buyer receives any payment from Seller in respect of any MDF
- - - ------- 
prior to the time that such MDF shall have been Earned, then within 30 days
after any final allocation of such MDF pursuant to Section 2.11(d)(iv), Buyer
shall reimburse to Seller any amount received by Buyer in respect of such MDF in
excess of Buyer's final allocation with respect thereto. Payments pursuant to
this Section 2.11(e) shall be made as follows:

(i) in the case of any MDF payments made by the vendor in cash or
cash equivalents, any payments pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) shall be
made in cash, in accordance with Section 2.10(e);

(ii) in the case of any MDF paid by the vendor in property other
than cash or cash equivalents, which property may be conveniently divided
in accordance with the allocation of such MDF pursuant to Section 2.11(d),
such property shall be so divided, and any payment pursuant to this Section
2.11(e) shall be made in kind; and

(iii) in the case of any MDF paid by the vendor in property other
than cash or cash equivalents, which property can not be conveniently
divided in accordance with the allocation of such MDF pursuant to Section
2.11(d), any payment pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) shall be made in such
reasonable manner as Buyer and Seller shall in good faith mutually agree.

(f) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, to the
extent that it is practicable for Buyer and Seller to negotiate [*] with any [*]
(including [*] and other criteria for [*]), Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
with each other in good faith to do so; provided, however, that if either party
-------- ------- 
shall reasonably determine that [*] would be likely to result in the [*] by such
party of an [*] of [*] in excess of [*] of the [*] of [*] that would otherwise
have been [*] by such

amended.

party under a [*], such party shall not be required to agree to any [*], except
to the extent required by the applicable [*]. In the event that Buyer and
Seller obtain [*] from any [*] with respect to any period, (i) all products
purchased by Seller from such [*] in such period shall be allocated between
Buyer and Seller for purposes of such [*] in the manner agreed to among Buyer,
Seller and such [*], (ii) Buyer and Seller shall each be [*] for [*] any [*]
from such [*] under its [*], (iii) the products of such [*] purchased by Seller
in such period shall not be considered in connection with any [*] of [*]
relating to any [*] pursuant to Sections 2.11(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), and
(iv) Buyer and Seller shall each certify to the other, within 20 days after the
end of each month, the aggregate amounts of [*] such party shall have [*] in
such month pursuant to such [*].

(g) All Co-op Funds made available by vendors in respect of any
products purchased or sold by any Customer (collectively, "Customer Co-op
Funds") shall be allocated to Buyer for the account of such Customer, and all
Co-op Funds made available by vendors in respect of any products purchased or
sold by the Retained Business shall be allocated to Seller. Buyer acknowledges
that each Customer shall be responsible for the completion of such certificates
and/or applications and procedures as any vendor shall require in connection
with any Customer Co-op Funds; provided, however, that Seller shall use
-------- ------- 
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its vendors and provide to Buyer
all forms and other requirements of such vendors necessary to obtain such
Customer Co-op Funds. Buyer shall assist Customers as Buyer shall from time to
time deem appropriate in complying with any such procedures and shall deliver
any related certificates and/or applications completed by any Customers to
Seller as provided herein. Seller shall process and send to the proper vendor
all such certificates and/or applications delivered to Seller hereunder, within
48 hours after receipt thereof, and shall remit to Buyer for the account of the
Customers entitled thereto any and all amounts paid to Seller by vendors in
respect thereof, within 15 days after such receipt. Seller shall cooperate with
Buyer and Customers in good faith regarding Customer Co-op Funds and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer and Customers in connection with
the collection of all Customer Co-op Funds to which Buyer and/or such Customers
shall be entitled (including using an overnight or second-day delivery service
to submit any such certificates and/or applications to the vendor, if Seller, in
its good faith judgment, determines that such delivery service is necessary or
appropriate). Except as provided in this Section 2.11(g), Seller shall not have
any responsibility in connection with any Customer Co-op Funds, including in
connection with (i) the failure of any Customer to complete (or of Buyer to
deliver
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

<PAGE>

to Seller) any certificate or application required to receive Customer Co-op
Funds, (ii) any such certificate or application that shall not have been
properly completed or timely submitted as aforesaid or (iii) any failure by the
applicable vendor to pay any such Customer Co-op Funds when due. Any "[*]" or
"[*]" of Customer Co-op Funds shall be for the account of Buyer.

(h) Seller shall provide Buyer with such information as Buyer
reasonably requests to enable Buyer to comply with any requirements imposed by
vendors under any MDF or Co-op Funds program, including any [*] pursuant to
Section 2.11(f), to the extent such information is available to Seller as a
result of the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

(i) Buyer acknowledges that Seller customarily receives payment
terms from vendors that may be more favorable than those received by other
purchasers of similar products from such vendors. Anything contained herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, the following guidelines shall apply in connection
with such favorable payment terms:

(i) payment terms with any vendor that are no more favorable to
Seller than the payment terms customarily received by Seller from such
vendor on the Closing Date shall not constitute MDF, Price Protection, Co-
op Funds or Other Soft Dollars for any purpose of this Agreement;

(ii) Seller shall use reasonable commercial efforts to keep Buyer
fully and fairly informed as to any and all negotiations and/or material
discussions between Seller and any vendor regarding payment terms,
including any such negotiations and/or discussions regarding the trading of
favorable payment terms against other relevant terms and conditions; and

(iii) except as provided in Section 2.11(i)(i), if favorable
payment terms are offered to Seller to induce Seller to purchase a greater
quantity of inventory of any vendor than Seller would customarily purchase
from such vendor under such circumstances, and the period of time given to
Seller to pay for such inventory is commensurate with the period of time
that Seller reasonably expects will be necessary to turn-over such
inventory, then such payment terms shall not constitute [*] for any purpose
of this Agreement; however, the value of any favorable payment terms
provided to Seller in connection with any other trade-off of the type
described in Section 2.11(i)(ii), determined as provided in Section 2.19,
shall constitute [*], to the
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-47-
<PAGE>

extent that such terms are more favorable to Seller than the payment terms
that Seller would otherwise have received from such vendor.

2.12. Restocking and Returns. (a) Buyer shall establish and
---------------------- 
maintain policies and procedures regarding the return and restocking of products
by Customers after the Closing Date and shall be solely responsible for
accepting and paying for such returned products, charging and collecting any
restocking fee relating thereto and otherwise administering such policies and
procedures vis-a-vis Customers, except that any policies or procedures involving
the direct return of products to Seller's designated return center shall require
the prior approval of Seller (such approval not unreasonably to be withheld or
delayed).

(b) During the Distribution Period, Seller shall repurchase from Buyer
any Returnable Products and/or Mis-Shipped Products returned by Customers to
Buyer after the Closing Date that were originally sold to Buyer by Seller
hereunder (or that were sold by Seller to such Customer prior to the Closing
Date), as provided in this Section 2.12 and Schedule 2.12 attached hereto. All
products tendered by Buyer for return pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be
delivered to Seller, with all freight charges to Seller prepaid, at Seller's
designated return center. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
inspect such product within two Business Days after Seller's receipt of any
product so tendered, to determine, in its commercially reasonable judgment,
whether or not such product is a Returnable Product or Mis-Shipped Product. If
Seller determines that any product so tendered is a Returnable Product or Mis-
Shipped Product, it shall accept such product for return pursuant to this
Section 2.12. If Seller determines that any product so tendered is not a
Returnable Product or Mis-Shipped Product, it shall so notify Buyer within one
Business Day following such determination (and shall provide Buyer, by
electronic mail, with any documentation relating thereto that Buyer shall
reasonably request). Upon receipt of such notification, Buyer shall attempt to
resolve any potential dispute regarding such returned product and shall notify
Seller within two Business Days thereafter of any such resolution. In the event
that Seller determines that a product tendered for return hereunder is not a
Returnable Product or Mis-Shipped Product because such product's carton has been
opened, then, if Buyer shall not otherwise notify Seller within such two-
Business Day period, Seller shall return such product to the Customer tendering
it, at the risk and expense of such Customer. Any dispute regarding whether a
product tendered for return is or is not a Returnable Product or Mis-Shipped
Product shall be resolved as provided on Schedule 2.12.
- - - -----------

<PAGE>

(c) Seller shall pay to Buyer for each Returnable Product or Mis-
Shipped Product repurchased by Seller from Buyer hereunder an amount (the
"Repurchase Price") determined as follows:

(i) in the case of any Returnable Product, the Repurchase Price
shall equal (A) the Return Cost of such Returnable Product, less (B) a
---- 
restocking fee equal to [*] of such Return Cost (the "Restocking Fee");

provided, however, that the Restocking Fee shall be [*] of Return Cost on
-------- ------- 
that portion, if any, of the aggregate Return Cost of Returnable Products
repurchased by Seller from Buyer hereunder in any quarter that exceeds [*];
and

(ii) in the case of any Mis-Shipped Product, the Repurchase
Price shall equal the [*], if any, paid by Buyer to Seller in respect of
such product.

The Repurchase Price payable by Seller to Buyer in respect of any repurchases of
Returnable Products shall be due and payable on the second Business Day
following the date that Buyer accepts such Returnable Product pursuant to
Section 2.12(b), subject to the netting arrangement provided for in Section
2.8(b). Seller shall reimburse all Customers returning any Mis-Shipped Products
to Seller for any freight charges incurred by such Customers in connection with
delivering such Mis-Shipped Products to Seller's return center as provided
herein, in accordance with Seller's usual practices relating thereto.

(d) Seller shall give Buyer reasonable prior notice of the effective
date of any determination by a vendor or manufacturer to stop accepting returns
of any product, or to accept the return of any product only on terms and
conditions that are, in the aggregate, materially less favorable to Seller than
the terms and conditions normally obtained by Seller on the Closing Date from
those vendors that permit returns (to the extent, in either such case, that
Seller receives reasonable prior notice of such effective date). If such vendor
or manufacturer has provided Seller with a window period following such
determination in which returns will be permitted, Seller shall give Buyer a
window period for such returns, which window period shall end no sooner than 15
days prior to the end of the window period provided to Seller by such vendor or
manufacturer.

(e) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
following provisions (and not Sections 2.12(a), (b), (c) and (d)) shall apply
with respect to any product (a "Defective Product") that is received by any
Customer (or any customer of a Customer) in defective condition (as
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-49-
<PAGE>

determined in accordance with the standards and procedures for defective
products established by the vendor of such product and in effect on the date of
receipt of such product by such Customer (the "Vendor Procedures"):

(i) unless the vendor of any Defective Product requires Seller
to process the return of such Defective Product pursuant to Section
2.12(e)(ii), Buyer shall cause any Customer receiving a Defective Product
hereunder to return such Defective Product directly to such vendor or as
such vendor shall otherwise direct, in accordance with the applicable
Vendor Procedures; and

(ii) if the vendor of any Defective Product requires Seller to
process the return of such Defective Product, Buyer shall cause any
Customer receiving such Defective Product hereunder to return such
Defective Product to Seller at its designated return center, and Seller
shall (A) process all such returns in accordance with the applicable Vendor
Procedures, (B) remit to Buyer the full amount, if any, received by Seller
from Buyer therefor and (C) on Buyer's behalf, adjust the ledger card for
the Customer that received such Defective Product to reflect a credit from
Buyer in favor of such Customer in the full amount paid or payable by such
Customer to Buyer in respect thereof.

Seller shall cooperate in good faith with Buyer and such Customer with respect
to any Defective Product received by any Customer hereunder, and shall provide
reasonable assistance to such Customer in connection with any documentation
and/or other requirements of the vendor relating thereto.

2.13. Compliance with Vendor Agreements. Buyer acknowledges that
--------------------------------- 
Seller will comply with any and all restrictions imposed by any dealership
agreement or distributorship agreement between Seller and any vendor,
manufacturer or distributor concerning the resale of product subject to such
agreement, including restrictions on methods of resale, permissible resale
customers and transshipment of products; provided, however, that Seller shall
-------- ------- 
promptly notify Buyer in writing of all such restrictions and shall cooperate
with Buyer in connection with all negotiations and other dealings of Seller with
such vendors, manufacturers and distributors regarding such restrictions.
Seller shall not be liable to Buyer, any Customer or any other person for the
imposition or consequences of any such restriction and shall have no liability
to Buyer, any Customer or any other person for lawfully cooperating with any
vendor, manufacturer or distributor in the enforcement of any such restriction
imposed by said parties.

2.14. Audit and Inspection. (a) Each party (the "Reviewed Party")
-------------------- 
shall permit the other party (the "Reviewing

-50-
<PAGE>

Party") and its representatives and auditors, at reasonable times, upon
reasonable notice, and with no more than reasonable frequency, to review, audit
or otherwise inspect the Reviewed Party's books and records relating to the
Reviewed Party's operations, sales, expenditures and product purchases, to the
extent reasonably required to verify any material fact relating to any right or
obligation under this Agreement. In connection with any review, audit or
inspection pursuant to this Section 2.14, the Reviewed Party shall cause its
personnel to be available to the Reviewing Party and its representatives and
auditors to answer reasonable inquiries regarding such transactions and the
Reviewed Party's accounting systems and procedures with respect thereto;

provided, however, that any such inquiries shall be conducted in a manner,
- - - -------- ------- 
including notice and frequency, that does not unduly interfere with the
operation of the Reviewed Party's business. As used in this Section 2.14, the
term "books and records" includes any books and records maintained on computer
systems or disks and, to the extent within the reasonable control of the
Reviewed Party, those under the custody and control of the Reviewed Party's
bank, accountants, agents or representatives. Any review, audit or inspection
pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be conducted in a reasonable manner, without
undue disruption of the business of the Reviewed Party.

(b) If any review, audit or inspection pursuant to Section 2.14(a)
discloses an underpayment, a Class A Event, or a Material Default by either
party, then such party shall immediately pay any amount due to the other party
hereunder and/or take all reasonable steps to cure any such Material Default or
Class A Event. The costs of any review, audit or inspection hereunder
(including attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses, and the actual
expenses of the Reviewed Party incurred in connection therewith) shall be
allocated as follows: (i) if the Reviewed Party committed a Material Default or
if the amount of the Reviewed Party's underpayment disclosed by such review or
audit was material during the period reviewed or audited, then all such costs
shall be borne by the Reviewed Party; (ii) if the Reviewed Party shall not have
committed a Material Default, and if there shall not be any underpayment by the
Reviewed Party during such period or if the amount of any such underpayment
disclosed by such review or audit shall not have been material, then all such
costs shall be borne by the Reviewing Party. For purposes of this Section
2.14(b), an underpayment shall be "material" if the amount of such underpayment
(A) exceeds $100,000 and (B) constitutes five percent or more of the required
--- 
payment to which such underpayment relates, as determined with respect to the
period reviewed or audited.

(c) All information or data obtained by a Reviewing Party under this
Section 2.14 shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 9.9.
Any dispute arising

-51-
<PAGE>

under or in connection with any review or audit conducted pursuant to this
Section 2.14, or any actual or alleged underpayment or default disclosed
thereby, shall be referred for resolution pursuant to Article VIII.

2.15. Disclaimer of Warranties; Risk of Loss; Limitation of
-----------------------------------------------------
Liability. (a) SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
- - - ---------
SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (INCLUDING ANY PURPOSE OF BUYER,
ANY CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PERSON) OF ANY PRODUCTS SOLD TO BUYER HEREUNDER.
BUYER UNCONDITIONALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY
BUYER FROM SELLER ARE PURCHASED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS AS BETWEEN SELLER AND BUYER.
SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE VALIDITY OF ANY PATENT OR
COPYRIGHT ON ANY PRODUCTS SOLD AND SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE TO BUYER, ANY
CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE EVENT OF ANY CLAIMED INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT
LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS, IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER
BE LIABLE TO BUYER, ANY CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND.

(b) Buyer shall cause a disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability substantially in the form of Section 2.15(a) to be included in each
Franchise Agreement or Datago Agreement entered into by Buyer after the date
hereof. If Buyer sells product to any Customer without such a disclaimer and
limitation in effect, Buyer hereby authorizes Seller to include such a
disclaimer and limitation on invoices sent by Seller to Customers on behalf of
Buyer hereunder.

(c) If and to the extent that Seller has been provided any
warranties, indemnification or other remedies with respect to a product or its
use or operation by the vendor, manufacturer or distributor of such product,
including any warranties with respect to product defects or indemnification or
product return or replacement in the event a product is claimed to infringe a
third party's intellectual property rights, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pass on to Buyer the benefit of such warranties,
indemnification or other remedies made available to Seller with respect to such
products sold by Seller to Buyer hereunder, as if Buyer had purchased the
products directly from such vendor, manufacturer or distributor, except that
Seller shall not be required to incur any unreimbursed costs or expenses in
connection such efforts and shall not be required to pass on to Buyer any such
benefits except to the extent that such benefits exceed what is required to
fully indemnify and hold Seller harmless against all losses, costs, damages,
liabilities and expenses incurred by Seller to which such warranties,
indemnification or other remedies in any way relate. Seller will exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain contractual commitments from vendors,
manufacturers and distributors requiring them to extend to Buyer the benefit of
any warranties,

indemnification and other remedies relating to products purchased by Seller for
sale to Buyer hereunder, as if Buyer had purchased such products directly from
such vendor, manufacturer or distributor, and requiring them to extend to Buyer
customary product return rights permitting the return of defective products.

2.16. Nonexclusivity. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in
-------------- 
the Purchase Agreement, Seller (on its own behalf) may sell any product to any
person at any location, whether or not such location is served by Buyer or any
Customer, or engage in such other business or businesses as Seller may from time
to time determine.

(b) Subject to Section 2.17, and without prejudice to any rights of
Seller hereunder (including the right to receive the Distribution Fee as
provided herein), during the Distribution Period Buyer may purchase products
from any source or sources whatsoever for sale to Customers through the Subject
Business, and may perform or purchase from any other source or sources any
logistics or other service relating to the Subject Business, whether or not the
same or a similar product or service may be supplied or provided by Seller
hereunder.

2.17. Transfer of [*] and/or [*]. (a) Subject to the terms and
-------------------------- 
conditions of this Section 2.17, during the Distribution Period, Buyer may (i)

all products of one or more specified vendors, [*] by Seller hereunder or (ii)

than 120 days prior to the effectiveness thereof; provided, however, that such

(b) If, after the [*] pursuant to Section 2.17(a)(i), [*] in any
quarter is less than [*] of [*] for such quarter, then the aggregate amount of
revenues recognized by Merisel and its subsidiaries and affiliates in respect of
the sale of any such [*] (or any successor product of the same vendor) to
Customers shall be included in [*] for such quarter for the following purposes
only:

(i) for the purpose of calculating the [*] and [*], to the extent
necessary to cause [*] to equal [*] of [*] for such quarter; and

(ii) for the purpose of calculating the amount of [*] to be
multiplied by the [*] in determining the [*], to the extent necessary to
cause such [*] to equal [*] of [*] for such quarter.

(c) If (i) Merisel and/or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall
cause the [*] of any [*] to be [*] from the [*] to any [*] pursuant to Section
2.17(a)(ii), which [*] is, in whole or material part, for the purpose of
reducing or minimizing the Distribution Fee payable hereunder, and (ii)

vendor of such product shall agree to a reasonable [*] of the [*] relating to
such [*] between Buyer and Seller, effective as of the effective date of such
discontinuation.

(f) If Buyer gives notice to Seller electing to [*] any product from
Seller pursuant to this Section 2.17, Seller shall have the right (exercisable
by written notice to Buyer given within 30 days from the date of Buyer's written
election), but not the obligation, to require Buyer to purchase, and Buyer shall
purchase, from Seller, on the effective date of such election, at the [*] (plus
any related freight charges) an amount of inventory of such product equal to the

such vendors and held by such Customer in inventory at the time such price
protection is made available shall be for the account of such Customer, in
accordance with the usual policies and procedures of Seller, the Customer and
the applicable vendor from time to time relating thereto. Buyer acknowledges
that each Customer shall be responsible for the completion of such certificates
and/or applications and procedures as any vendor shall require in connection
with any such Inventory-On-Hand Price Protection; provided, that Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its vendors and provide to
Buyer all forms and other requirements of such vendors necessary to obtain such
Inventory-on-Hand Price Protection. Buyer shall assist Customers as Buyer shall

Seller shall submit to the proper vendors all such certificates and applications
so received from Buyer and shall remit to the Customers entitled thereto (or as

of any Customer to complete (or of Buyer to deliver to Seller) any certificate
or application required to receive Inventory-On-Hand Price Protection, (ii) any
such certificate or application that shall not have been properly completed or
timely submitted as aforesaid or (iii) any failure by the applicable vendor to

remainder shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller in proportion to (A)
the amount of such product sold by Seller to Buyer hereunder, and (B) the

further, that if less than the full amount of such [*] shall have been

portion of the amount actually received based on the relative amounts
thereof allocated to Buyer and Seller pursuant to this Section 2.18(c)(ii).

(d) All [*] made available by vendors for the benefit of any Customer
shall be for the account of such Customer, in accordance with the usual policies
and procedures of Seller, the Customer and the applicable vendor relating
thereto, as in effect at the time such Price Protection is made available, and
any amounts received by Seller in respect of such [*] shall be remitted by
Seller to such Customer (or as Buyer otherwise directs) within 15 days after
such receipt. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
its vendors and provide to Buyer all forms and other requirements of such
vendors necessary to obtain the [*]. Except as provided in this Section
2.18(d), Seller shall not have any responsibility in connection with [*] made
available for the benefit of [*].

(e) Attached hereto as Schedule 2.18 is a memorandum describing
Seller's price protection policies for Franchisees and Datago Purchasers in
effect as of the Closing. Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in
this Section 2.18, the provisions of this Section 2.18 shall be applied
following the Closing in a manner consistent with the policies set forth in such
Schedule (or such successor policies as Buyer and Seller shall from time to time
mutually agree).

(f) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if in
any quarter during the Distribution Period
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-57-
<PAGE>

Buyer shall retain any Price Protection made available by any vendor for the
benefit of any Customer, or any Price Protection made available by any vendor
for the benefit of Seller and allocated by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section
2.18(c)(ii), then [*] for such quarter shall be adjusted by adding the quotient
(expressed as a percentage) obtained by dividing (i) the aggregate amount of all
[*] so [*] by Buyer in such quarter by (ii) [*] for such quarter. At the
reasonable request of Seller, Buyer shall certify to Buyer whether it has
retained any such Price Protection, and, if so, the aggregate amount so
retained.

2.19. Prompt Payment Discounts. (a) If any vendor shall offer to
------------------------ 
Seller a Prompt Payment Discount in respect of any amounts payable for products
of the types held for sale by Buyer hereunder purchased by Seller from such
vendor during the Distribution Period, and the interest rate equivalent of such
Prompt Payment Discount, determined as provided in Section 2.19(d), is a rate
per annum not less than the Prime Rate plus [*] per annum, then [*] shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to [*] such [*] with respect to its [*] from [*]
by [*] within the [*], except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.19.

(b) Except as provided in the proviso to Section 2.19(c), the
aggregate dollar amount of any such Prompt Payment Discount earned by Seller
during the Distribution Period shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, (x) an amount equal to the aggregate amount [*],

times (y) a rate per annum equal to the [*] as in effect at the time of
----- 
payment plus [*] per annum, times (z) the fraction described in clause (ii)
----- 
of the first sentence of Section [*] shall be allocated to Seller; and

(ii) Second, if any portion of such Prompt Payment Discount
shall be remaining, such remainder shall be [*] so purchased, [*] in
proportion to the [*] thereof, and allocated between Buyer and Seller in
accordance with the allocation percentages that would then be in effect for
such products pursuant to Section [*], if such products were at such time
subject to the allocation provisions of that Section.

Any Prompt Payment Discount allocated to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.19(b)
in any month shall be payable as provided in Section 2.10(e).

(c) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Seller
shall not be required to [*] of any [*]
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-58-
<PAGE>

if Seller certifies to Buyer that, in the good faith business judgment of
Seller, [*] of such [*] would not be commercially reasonable in light of
Seller's [*]; provided, however, that if Buyer notifies Seller in writing within
-------- ------- 
five Business Days after receipt of any such certificate that Buyer is willing
to [*] the required [*] at an [*] less than the [*] equivalent of such [*], as
determined pursuant to Section 2.19(d), then, subject to the negotiation of
other terms and conditions thereof mutually satisfactory to Buyer and Seller,
Seller shall accept such [*] from Buyer and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take advantage of any [*] so [*]. In any such case, the [*] of such
[*], in excess of the [*] by Buyer to Seller for such [*], shall be [*] to [*]
and [*] to [*] as provided in Section 2.10(e). Anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, Seller shall not be required to [*] any [*] from Buyer
pursuant to this Section 2.19(c) if such [*] could reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of any provision of any agreement evidencing any indebtedness
or other obligation of Seller or materially impair Seller's ability to [*] or
[*]. Any certification by Seller pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
2.19(c), and any notification by Buyer pursuant to the proviso to such Section,
shall be effective for 60 days from the date given, unless withdrawn by the
party giving the same, or unless such certification or notification (as
applicable) otherwise states.

(d) For purposes of this Section 2.19, the interest rate equivalent of
any Prompt Payment Discount shall be a rate per annum equal to (i) the amount of
the discount or other consideration offered, expressed as a percentage of the
vendor's invoice price, divided by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is
------- -- 
the number of days credit required to be foregone to receive the Prompt Payment
Discount and the denominator of which is 365. For purposes of this Section
2.19, the "number of days credit required to be foregone to receive a Prompt
Payment Discount" from any vendor shall equal the difference between (i) the
greater of (A) such vendor's standard payment terms and (B) the average number
of days between the date of invoice and the date of payment with respect to
orders by Seller filled by such vendor during the last full quarter and (ii) the
number of days between the date of invoice and the date by which payment must be
made to earn the Prompt Payment Discount, excluding for the purposes of clause
(i)(B) above all such orders for which Seller was required to pay a late payment
fee, interest charge or other penalty and all such orders for which any Prompt
Payment Discount was received.

2.20. Repurchase Obligations with Floor Planners. On or about the
------------------------------------------ 
Closing Date, Buyer is entering into Repurchase Agreements with the Floor
Planners set forth on Schedule 2.20
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-59-
<PAGE>

attached hereto, substantially in the forms attached as exhibits to such
Schedule. Each Repurchase Agreement provides for Buyer to repurchase from a
Floor Planner certain products repossessed by such Floor Planner pursuant to a
valid floor planning agreement between such Floor Planner and certain Customers.
Seller shall purchase from Buyer any product sold by Seller hereunder during the
Distribution Period and repurchased by Buyer from any Floor Planner pursuant to
any Repurchase Agreement, on substantially the same terms as those obtained by
Buyer from such Floor Planner; provided, however, that such terms shall in no
-------- ------- 
event be less favorable to Seller than the terms provided in the applicable
Repurchase Agreement (as in effect on the Closing Date) for purchases by Buyer
thereunder.

2.21. Performance Standards. (a) Seller shall use its best efforts
--------------------- 
to perform the Logistics Services to be provided by Seller hereunder in a manner
that meets or exceeds the Performance Standards for such Logistics Services set
forth in Schedule 2.21. If Seller fails to meet a Performance Standard for any
specified measurement period as set forth therein, Buyer shall be entitled to a
Performance Credit determined in accordance with Schedule 2.21 and payable as
provided in Section 2.10. Performance Credits represent negotiated reductions
in pricing on the basis of reduced service levels and shall not be deemed or
construed as a measure of damages. Buyer's right to receive any Performance
Credit to which it may be entitled hereunder shall be without limitation of any
rights or remedies of Buyer pursuant to Section 5.4, if applicable, but shall
otherwise be the exclusive remedy available to Buyer with respect to Seller's
failure to meet the relevant Performance Standard.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Seller agrees that, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, during the Distribution Period (but not
including any Winding Down Period), the Logistics Services provided by Seller
hereunder will be performed using the systems, procedures, methodologies and
facilities currently used by Seller in the operation of the Subject Business, as
such systems, procedures, methodologies and facilities may be modified from time
to time by Seller, in the good faith exercise of its reasonable business
judgment; provided, however, that Seller shall not, without Buyer's prior
-------- ------- 
written consent, make any modification to any such systems, procedures,
methodologies and/or facilities that could reasonably be anticipated to result
in (i) any material increase in the aggregate costs to Buyer or Customers of the
services provided by Seller hereunder (including any costs of training relating
to such modification), or (ii) any material decrease in the quality of such
services, or (iii) any material adverse effect on the way Buyer or the Customers
conduct their respective business operations, taken as a whole, except, in any
such case, for any such modification caused or required by force majeure, so
long as such force majeure continues to require such modification. All services
provided by Seller hereunder will be rendered by

-60-
<PAGE>

qualified personnel and in a manner consistent in all material respects with
good commercial practice in the industry. Seller will perform its
responsibilities under this Agreement in a manner that does not infringe, or
constitute an infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trade secret,
copyright or other proprietary right of any third party. During the Winding
Down Period, if any, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith regarding
any modifications proposed by Seller or Buyer with respect to the systems,
procedures, methodologies and/or facilities then used by Seller to perform the
Logistics Services.

2.22. Allocation of Inventory. (a) Without limiting any Performance
----------------------- 
Standards provided for herein or in Schedule 2.21, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to purchase and maintain inventories at its two Distribution
Centers with respect to all products on the Inventory List in amounts reasonably
anticipated by Seller to be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of both the
Subject Business and the Retained Business during the Distribution Period.

(b) If Seller's inventories of any product on the Inventory List are
insufficient at any time to meet the demand of the Subject Business and the
Retained Business, Seller's inventories of such product shall be allocated
between Seller and Buyer in proportion to the sales of all products of the
applicable vendor by the Retained Business and the Subject Business,
respectively, during the latest [*] for which information is available preceding
such allocation; provided, however, that until one or more products of any
-------- ------- 
vendor have been sold by the Subject Business and the Retained Business for at
least [*] after its introduction, inventories of all products of such vendor
shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer in proportion to the sales of all
products on the Inventory List by the Subject Business and the Retained
Business, respectively, during the [*] period for which information is available
prior to the date of such product's introduction. The allocation of inventory
provided for in this Section 2.22(b) shall be determined on a separate basis for
[*], based on the sales of the Subject Business and the Retained Business
shipped from [*], respectively, and shall be administered in all material
respects in accordance with and subject to the policies and procedures set forth
on Schedule 2.22(b) attached hereto, or such other policies and procedures as
Buyer and Seller may hereafter agree in writing. In any case in which a
vendor's products are sold under more than one vendor number, the allocation
provided for herein shall be determined separately for each such vendor number.
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-61-
<PAGE>

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.22(d), in the event of
any failure by Seller to comply with the provisions of Section 2.22(b) with
respect to any product, the result of which is that Buyer's allocation of such
product is less than the amount that should have been allocated to Buyer
thereunder, Seller shall compensate Buyer for such failure as follows:

(i) if, at the time such failure is determined, the product in
question shall be subject to allocation due to limited supply, then,
notwithstanding Section 2.22(b), all such product shall be specially
allocated first to Buyer, in the amount by which such earlier allocation
was deficient, and thereafter to Buyer and Seller in accordance with
Section 2.22(b); and

(ii) if, at the time such failure is determined, the product in
question shall not be subject to allocation due to limited supply, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer as liquidated damages for such failure, and not
as a penalty, an amount equal to [*] of the aggregate Inventory Cost of the
items of such product that should have been allocated to Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.22(b), but were not so allocated, up to a maximum payment
pursuant to this Section 2.22(c)(ii) of [*] in any six-month period.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.22(c), in the event that either party
(the "Interfering Party") shall willfully circumvent or otherwise interfere with
the proper functioning of the allocation procedures provided for in Section
2.22(b), and as a result of such willful circumvention or interference, the
Interfering Party shall receive a greater allocation of any constrained product
than the allocation to which such party would otherwise have been entitled, then
the Interfering Party shall pay to the other party, as liquidated damages for
such action, and not as a penalty, an amount equal to [*] of the aggregate
Inventory Cost of the items of such product that were allocated to the
Interfering Party, in excess of the amount to which the Interfering Party would
have been entitled pursuant to Section 2.22(b); provided, however, that if such
-------- ------- 
willful circumvention or interference results in the allocation to the
Interfering Party, in excess of the allocation to which such party would
otherwise have been entitled, of products having an aggregate Inventory Cost in
excess of [*] in any six-month period, such willful circumvention or
interference shall constitute a "Material Allocation Default" on the part of
such Interfering Party.

(e) The parties acknowledge that Buyer may [*] the allocation of any
product [*] Customer (or from any order by
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-62-
<PAGE>

a Customer) to [*], and that Seller may [*] of any product [*] one customer of
the Retained Business (or [*] any order by such a customer) [*], in each case as
such parties, in their reasonable business judgment, shall determine to be
appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor Seller shall [*]
any product [*] any order placed by a customer of the other party, or [*] the
[*] of any product to a [*] prior to the normal [*] process, unless prior
approval is obtained by the other party in writing.

(f) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that
inbound shipments of constrained products are, in the aggregate, allocated
reasonably fairly between the Distribution Centers, so that neither the Subject
Business nor the Retained Business is, in the aggregate, materially or
intentionally favored.

(g) Within 30 days after the end of each month during the
Distribution Period, Seller shall provide Buyer with a report, based on the
information contained in the reports provided to Buyer pursuant to Section
2.3(h), setting forth Buyer's and Seller's respective allocation percentages for
the month for each product on the Inventory List. A copy of such report for the
month ended December 31, 1993, is attached hereto as Schedule 2.22(g).

2.23. Consignment of Inventory. In the event any vendor of products
------------------------ 
on the Inventory List delays or imposes a hold on all shipments to Seller as a
result of Seller's failure to pay such vendor in a timely manner or as a result
of a determination by such vendor that Seller is not creditworthy, or in the
event Seller for any reason is no longer authorized or otherwise able to sell to
Buyer any products required to be on the Inventory List (and such delay or hold
imposed by such vendor, or such failure by Seller to be authorized or able to
sell such products, as applicable, continues uncured for more than 10
consecutive Business Days or for more than 15 Business Days in any period of 3
months), then, upon not less than 10 Business Days prior written notice to
Seller, Buyer may (but shall not be under any obligation to) elect to enter into
a separate agreement with such vendor to sell its products directly to Buyer for
sale through the Subject Business, in which case (i) Seller shall accept
delivery of such product at its Distribution Centers, (ii) Seller shall comply
at its expense with all reasonable security measures requested by Buyer to
segregate inventory provided by Buyer from Seller's inventory, (iii) Seller
shall provide all Logistics Services contemplated by this Agreement with respect
to such inventory as if it were supplied by Seller hereunder (except that (A)
Buyer shall not be obligated to pay Seller the [*] for such
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-63-
<PAGE>

products and (B) other appropriate adjustments shall be made to the obligations
of Buyer and Seller as necessary to reflect Buyer's ownership of such inventory)
and (iv) the monthly Distribution Fee payable with respect to each month in
which the provisions of this Section 2.23 shall be applicable shall be reduced
by an amount equal to (A) the aggregate Inventory Cost of all products purchased
directly by Buyer from the vendor thereof and sold during such month (determined
for this purpose as if Buyer were Seller) times (B) one plus the [*] for the
----- 
immediately preceding quarter times (C) [*]. If Buyer elects to exercise its
----- 
rights under this Section 2.23, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into a letter agreement or similar document setting
forth their mutual understanding regarding the implementation of the procedures
provided for hereunder, including provisions with respect to Seller's liability
for such products while in Seller's possession.

2.24. Recordkeeping and Accounting. (a) Seller shall maintain
---------------------------- 
accurate and complete books and records with respect to all transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all product purchases, sales and
returns, and all MDF, Co-op Funds, Price Protection, Prompt Payment Discounts
and other amounts received from vendors. Seller shall also maintain accurate
and complete books and records with respect to Seller's performance of all
Performance Standards and calculation of all Performance Credits. All such
books and records shall be maintained in accordance with GAAP throughout the
Distribution Period. All such books and records shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 9.11. Seller shall not dispose of such books and records
during the five-year period commencing upon expiration of the Distribution
Period; provided, however, that prior to the expiration of such five-year
-------- ------- 
period, Seller may dispose of any or all of such records at any time upon 60
days' prior written notice to Buyer; provided further, however, that during such
-------- ------- ------- 
60-day period, Buyer shall have the right, at Buyer's sole expense, to take
possession of all or any part of such records at a time to be agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer.

(b) With respect to all transactions occurring during the Distribution
Period, Seller shall continue to prepare and deliver to Buyer, the accounting
and management information and reports regarding the Subject Business described
in Schedule 2.24, in the form and at such times as described therein. If, at
any time during the Distribution Period, Buyer shall request any additional
reports or information regarding the Subject Business from Seller not described
on Schedule 2.24, then Seller shall use reasonable efforts to prepare and
deliver the requested items; provided, however, that if preparation or delivery
-------- ------- 
of such reports requires Seller to incur any costs or
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-64-
<PAGE>

expenses, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate appropriate compensation to Seller
for such costs and expenses, prior to Seller incurring any obligation therefor.

(c) During the Distribution Period, so long as Seller makes DC Watch
available to the Retained Business, Seller shall also make DC Watch available to
Buyer, on substantially the same basis as currently provided to the Subject
Business, subject to any changes in or modifications to DC Watch or its
availability that apply to both the Retained Business and Seller on a consistent
basis.

2.25. Continuing Performance. Subject to (i) the right of Seller to
---------------------- 
suspend shipments and sales as provided in Section 2.5(c), (ii) the provisions
of Section 9.9 regarding force majeure, (iii) any right of Buyer to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.5 and (iv) any right of Seller to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2, Seller shall continue to perform the
Logistics Services in good faith, notwithstanding any dispute between the
parties, including any arbitration or litigation proceedings, provided that
Buyer pays all amounts disputed in good faith into escrow as set forth in
Section 2.26 and pays the entire portion of such amount not disputed in good
faith to Seller as provided in Sections 2.5(c) and (d). Any failure by Seller
to comply with the provisions of this Section 2.25, which failure continues for
five Business Days after notice thereof to Seller, shall constitute a Class C
Event for all purposes of this Agreement.

2.26. Disputed Amounts. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
---------------- 
Sections 2.5(c) and (d), if either party in good faith protests or disputes any
amount asserted to be due to the other, such party shall not be in default of
its payment obligation hereunder if it deposits the disputed amount in escrow
with a major U.S. commercial bank or other qualified institution, as escrow
agent, with the interest thereon to be allocated to the party entitled to the
principal upon resolution of the dispute. In the event either party deposits
any disputed amount in escrow, such amount, together with any accrued interest,
shall be released by the escrow agent only upon (i) receipt of written
instructions signed by both Buyer and Seller or (ii) receipt of a final
nonappealable order of any court of competent jurisdiction or a final, binding
award of any mediation hereunder. As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller shall select an escrow agent by mutual agreement and
shall work together in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to
negotiate, execute and deliver an escrow agreement in customary form among
Buyer, Seller and such escrow agent, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Section 2.26.

2.27. Disaster Recovery Services. (a) Seller shall, at its expense,
-------------------------- 
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide and maintain, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date,

-65-
<PAGE>

disaster recovery back-up services for the data processing resources, systems
and services provided by Systemhouse pursuant to the Systemhouse Agreement (as
such terms are defined in Section 5.2), which disaster recovery back-up services
shall be designed to provide for a transition of such data processing resources,
systems and services to a disaster recovery facility in the event of an
interruption in the availability or accessibility of the Systemhouse Los Angeles
data center located in Buena Park, California. Such disaster recovery services
will conform to reasonable and customary levels in the microcomputer products
distribution industry and, without limiting the foregoing, such disaster
recovery back-up services shall include a data processing "hot site", dial-up
backup lines, and regularly scheduled tests to confirm the ability of the system
to recover from a disaster. Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer on or
before April 1, 1994, a written statement describing in commercially reasonable
detail the disaster recovery plan provided for in this Section 2.27(a). Seller
shall perform an initial test of such plan on or before June 1, 1994, and shall
achieve a successful test of such plan on or before July 1, 1994.

(b) On or before June 1, 1994, Seller shall, at its own expense,
develop a written plan to provide for a transition of Seller's headquarters
functions (including purchasing, accounts payable, traffic, operations,
accounting, and executive) to an alternate site in the event of any interruption
in the availability or accessibility of Seller's principal offices in
Pleasanton, California, due to a disaster or other event of force majeure. Such
disaster recovery plan shall be prepared in good faith and shall be in such form
and such detail as shall be commercially reasonable.

(c) Seller further agrees to provide reasonable cooperation and
assistance to facilitate Buyer's negotiation of a disaster recovery agreement
directly with Systemhouse or any other entity providing services to Seller that
would permit Buyer to assume responsibility and/or to have one or more third
parties assume responsibility for some or all of the Logistics Services in the
event of any termination of this Agreement prior to the second anniversary of
the Closing Date (or, if later, prior to the end of any Winding Down Period
hereunder); provided, however that Seller shall not be required to incur any
-------- ------- 
out-of-pocket expense in connection with such reasonable cooperation or
assistance, or to jeopardize Seller's own data processing system or the security
or confidentiality of, or proprietary rights of Seller in, any such data and
program files.

2.28. Financial Statements and Other Reports. (a) During the
-------------------------------------- 
Distribution Period, Seller shall maintain a system of accounting established
and administered in accordance with sound business practices to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied.

-66-
<PAGE>

(b) During the Distribution Period, Seller shall provide to Buyer
complete copies of the following financial statements, certificates and/or
reports, to the extent that Seller shall be required to provide the same to its
principal senior lender pursuant to any loan agreement, credit agreement, note
purchase agreement, indenture or similar agreement between Seller and such
principal senior lender, as in effect from time to time:

(i) on a monthly basis, the consolidated balance sheet of Seller
and its consolidated subsidiaries and related consolidated statement of
income for the preceding month;

(ii) on a quarterly basis, the consolidated balance sheet of
Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries and related consolidated
statements of income and cash flow for the preceding fiscal quarter;

(iii) on an annual basis, the consolidated balance sheet of
Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries and related consolidated
statements of income and cash flow for the preceding fiscal year, as
audited by Seller's independent certified public accountants; and

(iv) as applicable, any report or certificate by Seller relating
to the occurrence of any material adverse change in the business,
operations, properties, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of
Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

All such financial statements, certificates and/or reports shall be provided to
Buyer in substantially the same form provided to Seller's principal senior
lender (together with such certificates by financial officers of Seller or, in
the case of the annual financial statements contemplated by clause (iii) above,
the report of Seller's auditors), within five Business Days after the date first
provided to such principal senior lender.

(c) Attached hereto as Schedule 2.28(c) is a complete copy of the
consolidated balance sheets of Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries as at
September 30, 1993, and September 30, 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of income and cash flow of Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries
for the 12-month periods then ended (the "Financial Statements"). Seller
represents and warrants that the Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of
Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries at such dates and the results of their
operations for the period therein specified. Except for liabilities or
obligations which were incurred after September 30, 1993, in the ordinary course
of business, to the best

-67-
<PAGE>

knowledge of Seller after due inquiry, Seller and its consolidated subsidiaries
do not have any material liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due and whether or not the
amount thereof is readily ascertainable) that would be required to be disclosed
on Seller's consolidated balance sheet by generally accepted accounting
principles and that were not either fully reflected or disclosed in the
Financial Statements.

(d) Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that Seller is not in
default under any instrument or agreement of Seller for borrowed money, other
than any such default that (i) has been waived by the lender thereunder, or (ii)
would not have a material adverse affect on the business, operations,
properties, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of Seller or the
Subject Business, taken as a whole.

2.29. Other Soft Dollars. In the event that, at any time during the
------------------ 
Distribution Period, Buyer or Seller shall receive any Other Soft Dollars from
any vendor, and a reasonable person in the business of Buyer and Seller would
conclude that such Other Soft Dollars were received in lieu of any [*] or other
amount specifically addressed herein, then such [*] (and any cash, cash
equivalents, product or other consideration received in respect thereof) shall
be allocated between Buyer and Seller in the same proportion that it would have
been so allocated if such Other Soft Dollars constituted the [*] or other amount
in lieu of which they were received.

2.30. E-Mail. (a) During the Distribution Period, Buyer and its
------ 
Customers shall have the opportunity to send and receive messages through
Seller's existing electronic mail system, as modified from time to time by
Seller in the ordinary course of business, subject to any internal limits to
such system that may now or hereafter be in effect. Each Customer may maintain
no more than one hub per location, and may maintain no more than ten mailbox
addresses per hub; provided, however, that with the consent of Seller, which
-------- ------- 
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, a limited number of
Customers may maintain up to two hubs per location. Buyer may maintain, in the
aggregate, no more than 25 mailing lists at any time. Buyer and Customers shall
be responsible for their own telephone charges incurred in accessing Seller's
electronic mail system from any remote location and for all hardware required to
access the system. No additional charge shall be imposed by Seller for
electronic mail usage up to the limits described in this Section 2.30.
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-68-
<PAGE>

(b) If, at any time during the Distribution Period, Seller modifies
or replaces its electronic mail system, and such modification or replacement
requires a new gateway to be installed to link Seller's electronic mail system
and any other system used by Buyer, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in good
faith to assist Buyer in installing such a gateway; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
Buyer shall in such case reimburse or advance to Seller upon request any out-of-
pocket expense of Seller relating thereto.

(c) SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER REGARDING
ITS ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM AS NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER MODIFIED OR REPLACED AND
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DAMAGE OR EXPENSE
WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE BY BUYER OR ANY OTHER
PERSON OF SELLER'S ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM OR OF ANY FAULT OR FAILURE OF SUCH
SYSTEM. Each party shall treat electronic mail communications of the other
party (and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Customers to
treat electronic mail communications of both parties) as private communications
and shall not examine or monitor any such electronic mail communications that
are not directed to such party. To the extent either party inadvertently
obtains access to any such electronic mail communications during the course of
servicing or maintaining the electronic mail system, such party shall notify the
other party that such access was obtained and such electronic mail
communications shall constitute Confidential Information pursuant to Section
9.9.

2.31. CAPS; Telecommunications Charges. Buyer shall reimburse Seller
-------------------------------- 
monthly in arrears for the aggregate amount of all out-of-pocket
telecommunications and related charges and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with making CAPS available to Buyer and Customers on an on-line or
dial-up basis. Such charges shall be billed to Buyer by Seller based on usage,
in accordance with Seller's usual policies and procedures relating to such
charges as in effect on the Closing Date, and will be charged to Customers on
their ledger cards. Seller shall cause all such ledger card charges to be
posted within ten Business Days after Seller receives an invoice therefor from
AT&T (or such other carrier as shall provide such telecommunications services
hereunder). Seller shall not, however, have any liability to Buyer in respect
of the preceding sentence if Buyer changes or otherwise interferes with the
posting of such charges.

2.32. Ledger Cards. During the Distribution Period, Seller shall
------------ 
make available to Buyer the ledger card function of CAMBAR to record and invoice
such fees, freight charges and other amounts charged by Buyer to Customers as
Buyer shall reasonably determine and/or as provided herein. The use of the
ledger card function shall be in accordance with Seller's policies and
procedures applicable thereto on the Closing Date, and/or such

-69-
<PAGE>

other commercially reasonable procedures as Buyer and Seller shall in good faith
mutually agree.

2.33. Miscellaneous. (a) During the Distribution Period, Seller
------------- 
shall provide to those Customers that have "will call" privileges at a
Distribution Center on the date hereof, and a limited number of additional
Customers, the ability to arrange for delivery of products ordered by such
Customers at such Distribution Center on a "will call" basis, substantially in
accordance with Seller's current practices and procedures relating thereto.

(b) During the Distribution Period, (i) Seller shall not install at
either Distribution Center any material signs or other displays referring to
Seller or the Retained Business by name, without the prior consent of Buyer,
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, and (ii) Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate with one another in good faith regarding the installation
in the Distribution Centers of appropriate signs and displays identifying the
Subject Business and the Retained Business, respectively. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the parties agree that Seller shall in good faith choose a
trade name for Seller's logistics and distribution services business that shall
be different from the trade name used by Seller's reseller business, and that
Seller may use such trade name on such signs or other displays at each
Distribution Center as Seller shall, in its reasonable business judgment,
determine to be appropriate.

2.34. Additional Receivable Amount. (a) Anything contained herein
---------------------------- 
to the contrary notwithstanding, during the period from the date hereof through
the Extended Payment Termination Date, Buyer shall not be in default of its
payment obligations to Seller under Section 2.8(b) if and to the extent that the
aggregate principal amount of all Extended Payment Obligations (the "Additional
Receivable Amount") does not exceed $20,000,000.

(b) Prior to the Extended Payment Termination Date, Buyer shall pay a
financing fee to Seller on all Extended Payment Obligations (up to a maximum of
$20,000,000), from the Stipulated Due Date for each Extended Payment Obligation
to the date actually paid, at a variable rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate

minus 2 percent per annum. Such financing fee shall be due and payable monthly
- - - ----- 
in arrears pursuant to Section 2.10. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, Buyer shall pay interest to Seller at the rate set forth in
Section 2.5(b) on (i) any portion of the Additional Receivable Amount that
exceeds $20,000,000 and (ii) the entire Additional Receivable Amount, if any
Extended Payment Obligations shall remain outstanding after the Extended Payment
Termination Date.

-70-
<PAGE>

(c) All amounts paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.8(b) shall be
applied to reduce the Extended Payment Obligations in the order in which they
were incurred.

2.35. Configuration. In the event that, at any time during the
------------- 
Distribution Period, Seller shall provide configuration services on behalf of
Buyer to any Customers hereunder, including any Customers participating in the
existing MASTER program, the proposed MASTER Plus program, or otherwise, Seller
shall in good faith use commercially reasonable efforts to allocate its
configuration resources fairly between those configuration orders arising from
the Subject Business and those arising from the Retained Business. To that end,
Seller shall cause at least 90% of all configuration orders received by Seller
in each month to be started on a FIFO (first-in, first-out) basis, based on the
time, for each such order, that such order became a Confirmed Order (or, if, at
the time that such order became a Confirmed Order, one or more necessary kit
components for such order were out of stock at the applicable Distribution
Center, at the time that all such kit components shall first have become
available). Seller shall process all configuration orders so commenced in a
workman-like and commercially reasonable manner and shall not, in the aggregate,
discriminate unreasonably or for any improper purpose between configuration
orders arising from the Subject Business and those arising from the Retained
Business in managing the processing queue or allocating work cells.

2.36. Baseline Adjustment Event. If a Baseline Adjustment Event
------------------------- 
shall have occurred, Baseline Revenue and the Distribution Fee theretofore paid
shall be adjusted in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) A calculation shall be made as to the aggregate amount of
Applicable Revenue that the [*] referred to in the definition of Baseline
Adjustment Event would have been [*] during the period (the "Calculation
Period") beginning on the first day immediately following the Closing Date
through the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the Closing Date and
(ii) the termination of the Distribution Period (such aggregate amount
being hereinafter called the "[*]") had the Baseline Adjustment Event not
occurred.

(b) A calculation shall be made as to the aggregate amount of
Applicable Revenue that such [*] during the Calculation Period (such
aggregate amount being hereinafter called the "Actual Amount").

(c) If the [*] shall exceed the Actual Amount, a fraction (such
fraction being hereinafter called the "Actual
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

-71-
<PAGE>

Fraction") shall be calculated in which the numerator shall be the Actual
Amount and the denominator shall be the [*].

(d) Baseline Revenue shall be recalculated by reducing the amount
(such amount being hereinafter called the "[*] Baseline Revenue") of
Baseline Revenue attributed to the [*] referred to in the definition of
Baseline Adjustment Event to an amount determined by multiplying the Actual
Fraction by the [*] Baseline Revenue, provided, however, that in the event
----------------- 
the Actual Amount, calculated on an annual basis over the Calculation
Period, is equal to or greater than the [*] Baseline Revenue, the Baseline
Amount shall not be recalculated and there shall be no recalculation of the
Distribution Fee.

(e) The Distribution Fee shall be recalculated based upon the
Baseline Revenue recalculated as provided in clause (d) above, and Seller
shall pay to Buyer, promptly upon such recalculation, an aggregate amount
equal to the actual amount of Distribution Fee paid by Buyer to Seller
during the Calculation Period in excess of the Distribution Fee as so
recalculated.

such infringement would not have occurred without such modification or

(d) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer
with an itemization of all software other than Seller Licensed Software that is

described in this Section 3.1(e), or in any itemization of software provided
pursuant to Section 3.1(d), or any information contained therein, and all such
data and program files and information shall constitute confidential and

contrary notwithstanding, the Software License shall be limited, as to such
Third Party Materials, to such rights as may lawfully be granted under any
applicable license or other arrangement governing the use thereof. Seller

----- 
ratably from 125% in the first month of the Winding Down Period to 0% in the

to exceed the two-year period following the Closing Date), at no additional cost
to Buyer, the full-time services, during normal business hours, of three
programmers (the "Mainframe Team"), to develop applications relating to the
Subject Business for Seller's mainframe computer. The Mainframe Team shall be
employed by Seller, and Seller shall have the sole authority to hire and fire
members of the Mainframe Team; provided, however, that the members of the
-------- ------- 
Mainframe Team shall be generally comparable in salary, training and experience
to the programmers employed by Seller to develop its own mainframe applications.
The Mainframe Team shall initially include the persons set forth on Schedule

other projects without Buyer's prior written consent (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed). The Mainframe Team will work exclusively
on projects defined and prioritized by Buyer; provided, however, that Seller
-------- ------- 
shall have the right to approve and/or manage such projects to the extent that
such projects could reasonably be expected to have an impact on the Seller or
any of the Retained Business.

(d) During any Winding Down Period, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to provide Buyer with such information regarding the
Subject Business accessible through CAMBAR as Buyer shall reasonably request,
and (ii) to maintain the interface between CAPS and Seller's Order Processing
System; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to provide Buyer
-------- -------

utilized by Buyer or Customers in connection with the Subject Business (to the
extent that (i) at the time any such upgrade or modification is proposed, such
systems and such software interface and are compatible and (ii) in the case of
any software adopted for such purpose after the date hereof, Buyer has advised
Seller that such software is in use and has advised Seller of all interfaces
between such software and such systems), and shall cooperate with Buyer in good
faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that compatibility and
interoperability between Seller's computer system and any such material software
are maintained at levels not less than currently in effect.

conditions as Seller and such Franchisees shall mutually agree. Seller may from
time to time offer any CLTV programming directly to any Franchisee, on such
terms and conditions as Seller and such Franchisee shall mutually agree. Seller
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to install satellite dishes
comparable to the ones currently in place, at any current or future Franchisee
location, on such terms and conditions as Seller and such Franchisee shall
mutually agree, and without any charge (other than a royalty at normal rates) or
interference by Buyer. Buyer shall not remove or take any action to remove or
induce any Franchisee to remove any satellite dish owned or operated by Seller
from any current or future Franchisee location.

(d) Buyer may use any satellite dishes owned or operated by Seller at
any Franchisee location, at its own expense but without any fee imposed by

----------------- 
administers a national accounts program (the "National Accounts Program") to

peripherals and related products by Seller, through its Retained Business, to
business customers at multiple locations in the Designated Territory. Pursuant
to the National Accounts Program, including those certain National Accounts

Dealers"), NAP Dealers have agreed to provide services to National Accounts
Program customers, as requested from time to time by Seller, including delivery,
installation, maintenance and repair services, and Seller has agreed to pay any
NAP Dealers performing such services fees in amounts calculated pursuant to
Seller's policies and procedures for the National Accounts Program, as in effect

the Closing Date, Seller shall no longer provide any NAP Dealer with any fee
(currently calculated as [*] of Seller's gross margin on such sale) for any sale
by Seller to any customer in the marketing territory of any NAP Dealer, without
the active support or participation of such NAP Dealer. Except as provided in
the preceding sentence and as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the
Purchase Agreement, the National Accounts Program shall not be affected by the
Purchase Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby; provided,

Program at any time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Buyer.

4.4. National Service Agreements. (a) Seller currently provides
--------------------------- 
computer-related services and support on a nationwide basis to end-users and
resellers through its Retained Business. Prior to the Closing Date, a number of
Franchisees sold service contracts for Seller to their end-user customers.
After the Closing Date, Seller may in its discretion provide certain
Franchisees, as value-added resellers, the opportunity to sell service contracts
for Seller in markets that do not directly conflict with the Retained Business,

Seller in the computer software and data files used by Seller prior to the
Closing Date to allocate and keep track of the fees earned in connection with
service contracts sold and/or performed by two or more Franchisees in multiple
locations (the "NSA System"). Buyer shall pay any expenses incurred in

4.5. Help Desk. (a) Seller currently provides a nationwide
--------- 
telephone help desk for computer-related assistance and support through its

of Franchisees sold National Help Desk contracts for Seller to their end-user
customers. After the Closing Date, Seller may in its discretion provide to
certain Franchisees, as value-added resellers, the opportunity to sell National
Help Desk contracts to end-users in markets that do not directly conflict with
the Retained Business, on such terms and conditions as Seller and such

services available to Franchisees and Datago Purchasers, for their internal

and/or Datago Purchasers shall mutually agree.

4.6. MASTER and MASTER Plus. (a) After the Closing Date, Seller
---------------------- 
shall continue to provide access to the MASTER program and related systems to
the Customers set forth on Schedule 4.6(a) attached hereto but shall not be
required to make MASTER available to any other person. Seller may terminate
MASTER for any Customer (i) at any time, if Seller shall at such time have the
right to terminate MASTER for such Customer pursuant to the MASTER agreement
between Seller and such Customer, a copy of which is attached hereto as an
exhibit to Schedule 4.6(a)-1; and/or (ii) at such time as MASTER Plus shall have
become available, tested and ready to replace MASTER for such Customer. Buyer
shall cooperate with Seller and take all reasonable actions requested by Seller
to notify Customers participating in MASTER, and their end-user customers, that
amounts invoiced to such end-user customers in respect of MASTER sales (whether
for periods before or after the Closing Date) shall be payable to the account of
and in the manner directed by Seller. Buyer shall promptly forward to Seller
all payments received by Buyer with respect to such amounts, together with such
endorsements or assignments as shall be necessary for the transfer thereof to
Seller. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Buyer in connection with any such actions. All sales under the
MASTER program shall constitute sales by Buyer through the Subject Business for
all purposes of this Agreement. The MASTER program will be administered in
accordance with the agreement and other procedures in effect on the Closing
Date, which agreement and other procedures are summarized on Schedule 4.6(a)-1.

(b) Seller is currently developing the MASTER Plus program and related
systems. MASTER Plus is currently expected to augment CAPS by providing
Customers with the ability to place orders requiring (i) electronic staging of
inventory, (ii) order complete, (iii) central configuration, and/or (iv) direct
shipment to the end-user customer. Orders placed through MASTER Plus are
currently expected to be financed by one or more floor planners. MASTER Plus is
currently expected to be available on a fee basis, in accordance with a matrix
to be agreed; provided, however, that such fee matrix will be reasonably
-------- ------- 
designed to reimburse Seller for the fully-burdened cost to Seller of the MASTER
Plus program, including the cost of all returns and/or cancellations (to the
extent permitted by such program), configuration and freight, and the estimated
total costs associated with holding the additional inventory required by the
MASTER Plus program (including costs relating to interest, obsolescence,
insurance and risk of loss). All sales under the MASTER Plus program will
constitute sales by Buyer through the Subject Business for all purposes of this
Agreement, and fees payable in respect of the MASTER Plus program will be in
addition to the Monthly Distribution Fee and other amounts due hereunder.

-80-
<PAGE>

(c) In addition to any fees for participation in MASTER Plus to be
borne by participating Customers, Buyer shall be responsible for the cost of
training Customers to use the MASTER Plus system. No Customer shall be provided
access to MASTER Plus until such Customer shall have successfully completed the
training and certification program therefor.

(d) Seller shall consult with Buyer in good faith from time to time
regarding the programming and implementation of MASTER Plus and shall endeavor
to make such changes therein as Buyer shall reasonably request. Anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Seller shall not be required
to make any change to the MASTER Plus system if Seller, in its reasonable
discretion, believes that such change would interfere with any other systems or
operations of Seller or otherwise result in an adverse effect upon the business
or operations of Seller or any part thereof. In the event that Seller, in its
reasonable discretion, agrees to make any changes requested by Buyer, and such
changes require programming resources in addition to the Mainframe Team, Buyer
shall pay all costs relating to such additional programming resources.

ARTICLE V

REMEDIES

5.1. Overview. This Article V sets forth the respective rights and
-------- 
obligations of Buyer and Seller in the event of the occurrence of any Class A
Event, Class B Event or Class C Event, in each case as defined herein. The
remedies available to Buyer hereunder are not cumulative; no event or occurrence
may constitute both a Class A Event and a Class B Event or Class C Event, or any
other combination of such categories, for purposes of this Article V.

5.2. Definitions. As used in this Article V, the following terms
----------- 
have the corresponding meanings:

"Adjusted Operating Profit" for any period means net income recognized
------------------------- 
by Buyer in such period in respect of the Subject Business, after provision for
income and other taxes, but before any extraordinary items, plus depreciation,
---- 
plus a percentage of all interest charges deducted in calculating net income
- - - ---- 
equal to the percentage that Excluded Indebtedness bears to Total Indebtedness.
"Total Indebtedness" for any period means the average total principal amount of
------------------ 
interest-bearing indebtedness of Buyer outstanding during such period.

"Excluded Indebtedness" for any period means an amount of interest-bearing
- - - ---------------------- 
indebtedness equal to (i) goodwill minus (ii) paid-in capital, determined in
----- 
each case for Buyer on an average basis for such period in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied; provided,
-------- 
however, that the
- - - ------- 

-81-
<PAGE>

amount of Excluded Indebtedness, and the amount of all interest-bearing
indebtedness other than Excluded Indebtedness, shall be adjusted on a pari passu
---- -----
and cumulative basis as if all positive cash flow of the Subject Business from
operating activities were retained by Buyer and used to reduce such
indebtedness. If Excluded Indebtedness is reduced by such positive cash flow
below the amount of goodwill minus paid-in capital, as determined as provided
----- 
above, Adjusted Operating Profit shall be increased by the interest income that
would have been generated by such cash flow if retained by the Subject Business.

"Assumed Agreement" has the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 5.9.
----------------- 

"Assumed Freight Charges" means, for any period during the Special
----------------------- 
Transition Period, the aggregate amount of all freight charges that would have
been incurred by Buyer if all products sold by Buyer through the Subject
Business during such period and included in calculating Buyer Freight Charges
for such period had been shipped by Seller, on behalf of Buyer hereunder, from
the [*] of the Customers ordering such products, in accordance with the terms
and conditions applicable to such shipments under this Agreement, as in effect
on the Special Closing Date, determined as if the Distribution Period had
continued in effect through the Special Transition Period.

"Assumed Distribution Fee" means, for any period during the Special
------------------------ 
Transition Period, the Distribution Fee that would have been payable by Buyer in
respect of such period in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,

(other than any Assumed Agreement which by its terms is terminable at the option
of such Customer), prior to the termination or expiration date set forth
therein, and it is finally determined, by a court of competent jurisdiction or
by mediation pursuant to Section 8.2, that such Customer had the right to
terminate such Assumed Agreement because of the [*] of Buyer to [*] the [*]
therein, and either (i) such [*] are more [*] than the [*] set forth herein or
(ii) Buyer's [*] to [*] such [*] was caused by Seller's [*] to [*] the [*] in a
[*] that [*] the [*] set forth herein, then Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer, its successors and assigns, from and against any and all losses,
costs, liabilities, obligations and expenses, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys and accountants, arising out of or resulting from such
termination of such Assumed Agreement by such Customer. Anything contained
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the cap on the aggregate

otherwise be accorded by the application of the automatic stay provisions to
such other party is not necessary to relieve the Affected Party from financial
pressure or to permit the Affected Party to attempt an effective repayment or
reorganization plan in bankruptcy.

survive the termination of the Distribution Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, following any termination pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section 6.2,
each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to finish any Confirmed
Order providing for configuration services and complete any other pending
Confirmed Order received prior to the date of such termination, in each case to
the extent that such order is within the reasonable control of such party. The
provisions of Sections 8 and 9 shall in any event survive any termination of the
Distribution Period.

-------------------

8.1. Resolution by Parties. In the event that any dispute arises
--------------------- 
regarding the interpretation of this Agreement or any of the respective rights
and obligations of the parties hereunder, the parties shall cooperate with one
another in a good faith effort to resolve such dispute on an amicable basis,
consistent with the general purposes of this Agreement. To that end, Buyer and
Seller shall each appoint two senior executives (including at least one
financial or accounting officer) to represent such party in negotiations under
this Section 8.1. The initial representatives of each party are set forth on
Schedule 8.1 attached hereto. Either party may change one or more of its
representatives appointed pursuant to this Section 8.1 by written notice to the

amended.

-102-
<PAGE>

other refer such dispute to mediation by a panel of two or three independent
mediators, who shall be qualified by education, experience and training to
resolve the issues to be mediated. Any mediation hereunder shall be held in San
Francisco, California, or such other place as the mediators shall reasonably
determine. Buyer and Seller shall each appoint one mediator; if the two
mediators are unable to resolve any issue before them, they shall appoint a
third independent mediator, and the decision of the majority shall be the
decision of the panel. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with the mediators in
good faith and shall provide, on a confidential basis reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, Seller and the mediators, such information as the mediators shall
reasonably request in connection with any mediation. The mediators may adopt
such reasonable rules regarding the conduct of any mediation as such mediators
shall deem necessary or appropriate.

(b) The reasonable costs and expenses of any mediation pursuant to
this Section 8.2 shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller, unless the decision
of the mediators shall otherwise direct.

(c) In the case of any dispute referred to mediation hereunder in
which the dollar amount in question is less than [*], and no relief other than
money damages has been requested by either party, the decision of the mediators
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the parties hereto and
judgment may be entered thereon in any federal or state court having
jurisdiction. Mediation conducted hereunder shall be non-binding with respect
to any dispute in which the dollar amount in question equals or exceeds [*], and
any dispute in which either party requests relief other than money damages
regardless of the amount in dispute, and any evidence with respect to any
decision rendered in any such non-binding mediation shall not be admissible in
any legal, equitable, arbitral or other proceeding relating to any dispute
hereunder.

(d) If, in the case of any dispute in which the dollar amount in
question equals or exceeds [*], or in which either party requests relief other
than money damages regardless of the amount in dispute, such dispute is not
resolved for any reason (including the inability of the parties or the mediators
to schedule such mediation) within 60 days following delivery of the notice
requesting mediation under this Section 8.2, then neither party shall have any
further obligation to attempt to resolve such dispute through negotiation or
mediation under this Article VIII or otherwise and each party shall have the
right to exercise whatever rights or remedies it may have hereunder or at law or
in equity, including the right to initiate litigation.
- - - -----------
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended.

<PAGE>

(e) Each party shall notify the other in writing within 30 days after
the Closing Date as to the initial mediators selected by such party. Either
party may change the mediator selected by such party upon written notice to the
other party.

8.3. Expedited Mediation. In the event of any dispute regarding the
------------------- 
existence, cure or continuation of any Material Default, the mediation process
shall be expedited as follows:

(a) If the dispute is not resolved through negotiations by the senior
executives appointed pursuant to Section 8.1 within three Business Days
following written notice from either party requesting such negotiations, the
matter shall immediately be referred to mediation pursuant to Section 8.2, with
no requirement of ten Business Days prior written notice as set forth in Section
8.2.

(b) If the dispute is not resolved within seven Business Days
thereafter for any reason (including the inability of the parties or the
mediators to schedule such mediation), neither party shall have any further
obligation to attempt to resolve such dispute through mediation and each party
shall have the right to exercise whatever rights or remedies it may have
hereunder or at law or in equity, including the right to initiate litigation.

9.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
------------ 
counterparts and on separate counterparts, and each such counterpart shall
constitute an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall
constitute one agreement.

9.5. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
------------- 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to
contracts made and performed wholly therein.

9.6. Amendment, Modification and Waiver. This Agreement shall not be
---------------------------------- 
amended or modified except pursuant to an instrument in writing signed by Seller
and Buyer. No purported waiver hereunder (including any purported waiver due to
either party's failure to send a written notice of default to the other party)
shall be effective without a written instrument signed by the party against whom
such waiver is sought to be enforced. The waiver of any provision hereunder on
any occasion shall not constitute a waiver of any other provision, or of the
same provision on any other occasion.

9.7. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid
------------ 
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable
the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction. If any provision is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be construed by any appropriate judicial
body by limiting or reducing it to the minimum extent necessary to make it
legally enforceable.

9.8. Force Majeure. Seller shall not be liable for any delay or
------------- 
failure to deliver any products ordered by any Customer from Buyer as
contemplated hereby or to perform any of its other obligations hereunder if such
delay or failure is caused by a strike, lockout or other labor dispute (other
than any such dispute between Seller and members of its own work force); war,
riot, civil commotion or act of a public enemy; fire, flood, accident, storm or
act of God; change in law or regulation, embargo or other government
restriction; or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Seller ("force
majeure"). In the event of any force majeure event, Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact of such event and to re-
establish full services as soon as reasonably practicable, including but not
limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to secure alternative sources
of supply, if available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions. If a
force majeure event results in the occurrence of any Class C Event that
continues for a period of ten or more consecutive Business Days (or that
continues for a period of five or more consecutive Business Days, if a
reasonable person in the business

-106-
<PAGE>

of Buyer and Seller would believe that it was highly unlikely for Seller to cure
such Class C Event within such ten Business Day period), Buyer may cause the
Distribution Period to be terminated (with effect as provided in Section 6.3),
upon not less than three Business Days' prior written notice to Buyer;
otherwise, no delay or failure caused by force majeure shall constitute a breach
of any provision of this Agreement or result in a termination of this Agreement
or of the Distribution Period or result in the imposition of damages (including
liquidated damages) or Performance Credits in respect of such delay or failure
upon any party hereto.

9.9. Confidentiality. (a) Each of Buyer and Seller shall maintain
--------------- 
the confidentiality of all confidential or proprietary information of the other
party obtained hereunder, including marketing, advertising and promotional
methods, agreements with vendors, manufacturers, distributors and other
suppliers, Franchise Agreements, Datago Agreements, customer lists and other
information regarding the customers of any Customer, pricing policies, financial
information, sales volume, inventory procedures and amounts, logistic systems,
computer programs (including source code and object code), ideas, concepts,
processes, research and development and other information related to the
business or customers of such other party, whether such information shall be in
written, machine-readable, graphic or other form (collectively, "Confidential
Information"). Neither party shall use (except in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby), transfer, release, publish or
disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information of the other
party, without such other party's prior written consent (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed), except as required by law. Confidential
Information of any party does not include any information that (i) becomes
generally known or available to the public, through no fault of the other party,
(ii) except as provided in Section 9.9(c) was known by the other party, without
any obligation of confidentiality, prior to the date hereof, or (iii) is
lawfully obtained by the other party after the date hereof from a third person
not bound by any obligation of confidentiality to the first party. Each party
understands that the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law for a
breach or threatened breach by such party of the terms of this Section and
therefore agrees that in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the
other party may obtain an injunction or restraining order to enjoin such breach
or threatened breach, in addition to any other available remedy.

(b) Seller will establish and maintain safeguards against the
destruction, loss or alteration of Buyer's data in the possession of Seller
which are not less rigorous than those currently utilized by Seller to protect
its own data. In the event that additional safeguards for Buyer's data are
reasonably requested by Buyer, upon prior written approval by Buyer of any

-107-
<PAGE>

additional costs or charges, Seller shall provide such additional safeguards and
Buyer shall reimburse Seller as incurred for any additional costs thereby
incurred by Seller. Buyer's data will be and remain Buyer's property. Seller
is authorized to have access to and to make use of such data as is appropriate
for the performance by Seller of its obligations under this Agreement. Upon the
termination of this Agreement for any reason or, with respect to any particular
data that shall no longer be required by Seller in order to render services
under this Agreement, on the date so requested by Buyer, such data will be
either erased from the data files maintained by Seller or, if Buyer so elects,
returned to Buyer by Seller, and an officer of Seller will deliver to Buyer such
certification of Sellers' fulfillment of this obligation as Buyer may reasonably
request. Buyer's data will not be utilized by Seller for any purpose other than
in accordance with this Agreement, nor will Buyer's data or any part thereof be
disclosed, sold, assigned, leased or otherwise disposed of to third persons by
Seller or commercially exploited by or on behalf of Seller, its employees or
agents.

(c) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
information regarding the Subject Business, including information regarding
Customers and any customer of any Customer, shall be maintained as confidential
following the Closing Date, whether or not such information was in the
possession of Seller on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall maintain
such procedures and safeguards as Seller determines may be necessary to ensure
that Confidential Information obtained on or before the Closing Date for use in
connection with the central confirmation, special order purchasing, soft
allocation, traffic, direct ship and other functions and services that require
such information in the performance of their duties is not available or
disclosed to any sales representative of the Retained Business, any person in
any company-owned branch location, or any other employee or office of the
Retained Business who does not require access thereto in connection with his or
her proper function.

(d) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Buyer
