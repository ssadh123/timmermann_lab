CLARK EQUIPMENT EXPECTS
STRONGER-THAN-ANTICIPATED THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS

SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, September 23, 1994 -- Clark Equipment Company (NYSE:
CKL) today announced it expects stronger-than-anticipated third quarter
earnings due to significantly improved productivity, pricing and demand in
key domestic and European markets. The announcement was made by Leo J.
McKernan, Clark Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Noting that the cyclical upturn in major Clark markets is offsetting
traditional seasonal effects, Mr. McKernan pointed out that Clark third
quarter earnings also include the first full quarter of results from its
recent acquisition, Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment Company.

Clark Equipment Company designs, manufactures and markets skid-steer
loaders, construction machinery, asphalt paving equipment, and axles and
transmissions for off-highway equipment.
