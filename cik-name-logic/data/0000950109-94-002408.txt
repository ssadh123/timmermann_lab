FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AmSouth takes $53 million in fourth quarter charges primarily to reduce future 
interest rate risk

BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, DECEMBER 15, 1994 -- AmSouth Bancorporation (NYSE:ASO)
announced today that it is restructuring its balance sheet to reduce future 
interest rate risk and as a result will take fourth quarter charges totaling 
approximately $53 million, or $.57 per share.

AmSouth chairman and chief executive officer, John W. Woods, said the 
company is taking these charges primarily to reduce its interest rate 
sensitivity in the current rising interest rate environment, particularly in 
view of recent very sharp increases in short-term rates. The earnings impact of 
recent rapid increases in interest rates has been compounded by AmSouth's 
acquisitions of several large thrifts over the past 12 months.

The effect of the $.57 per share charge is to essentially offset any 
earnings for the fourth quarter, with earnings per share for the year now 
estimated to be in the $2.25 to $2.30 range.

The sale of $369 million of selected securities from the company's 
available for sale portfolio will account for $29 million of the pretax charge, 
while interest rate swap contracts represent $17 million of the pretax charge. 
An additional charge of $7

million is being taken primarily to rebuild operating reserves to levels 
consistent with the growth AmSouth has experienced over the course of 1994.

The securities being sold consist of low yielding U.S. Treasury securities 
and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities with both fixed and floating rates. 
AmSouth will reinvest proceeds from these sales in shorter-term securities.

"We believe that this reduces our interest rate sensitivity going forward 
and will also have a positive impact on future earnings," Woods said.

"Loan growth continues to be strong, and we have had great success in our 
recent CD promotion by raising over $850 million of longer-term deposits and 
adding 17,000 new customers. These new deposits also reduce our interest rate 
sensitivity going forward. The company is continuing to make progress on a 
number of revenue enhancement and expense control initiatives, the benefits of 
which should be realized over the next year," Woods added.

"Our primary focus continues to be the full integration of our newly 
acquired Florida and northwest Georgia franchises as well as rebuilding our 
earnings momentum in 1995," he concluded.

At September 30, 1994 AmSouth Bancorporation reported assets of $16.9 
billion and shareholders' equity of $1.3 billion, with an equity to assets ratio
of 7.82%. Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 1994 was 
$125.9 million or $2.25 per share. The company operates 309 banking offices in 
four southeastern states: 145 banking offices in Alabama, 137 offices in 
Florida, 21 offices in Tennessee and six in Georgia. Bank-related affiliates 
include AmSouth Mortgage Company, Inc., AmSouth Investment Services, Inc., and 
AmSouth Leasing Corporation.
