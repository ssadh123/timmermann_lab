HIBERNIA TO ENTER NEW MARKET WITH PROGRESSIVE BANCORPORATION MERGER

NEW ORLEANS -- Hibernia announced today it has signed a
definitive agreement to merge with Progressive Bancorporation,
Inc., a transaction that would provide entry into the important
Houma market for the first time.

The company operates Progressive Bank and Trust, with $140
million in assets and five offices; three in Houma and one in
Chauvin in Terrebonne Parish and a supermarket office in Thibodaux
in Lafourche Parish. With a 13% deposit market share, it is the
third-largest bank in Terrebonne Parish.

This coastal market in southeast Louisiana boasts strong
seafood, maritime, petroleum-support and sugar cane industries and
in recent years has witnessed significant growth in health-care
services, new-home construction and retail sales. Hibernia's
emphasis on serving small businesses with automated cash-management
services like TABBS -- combined with trust and brokerage services,
mutual funds and annuities, mortgage banking, longer office hours
and virtually 24-hour telebanking -- will significantly enhance
banking for Progressive customers.

Progressive shareholders would receive approximately four
shares of Hibernia stock for each Progressive share in a tax-free
pooling of interests. Hibernia would also redeem Progressive's
preferred stock and pay off the company's outstanding debt. Based
on a Nov. 30 closing price of Hibernia common stock of $7.875, the
transaction has a total value of approximately $26 million. The
merger is subject to approvals by regulators and Progressive
shareholders and should be completed in the first half of 1995.

"The Houma region has enjoyed a tradition of service from
Progressive Bank and Trust that Hibernia intends to build on," said
Stephen A. Hansel, Hibernia president and CEO. "We also will
continue the hometown responsiveness, management and community-
minded spirit that have made Progressive customers some of the most
loyal in the area."

"Progressive is 100% committed to a partnership with
Hibernia," said John H. Laing, chairman, president and CEO of
Progressive. "We've wanted to add more services for a long time so
our customers could experience the kind of one-stop banking they've
requested. Now we'll be able to do that."

Progressive customers should continue using their checks,
making loan payments and conducting other transactions just as
before. Only after the bank is converted to Hibernia's operating 
systems would checks, signs and forms change.

Hibernia National Bank is Louisiana's largest statewide bank. 
When the Progressive Bancorporation merger and four other pending
mergers are complete, it will have approximately $6.5 billion in
assets and 160 banking locations serving 22 parishes and 55 cities.
