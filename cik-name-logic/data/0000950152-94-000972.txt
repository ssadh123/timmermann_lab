ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On September 1, 1994, Dana Corporation issued
the following press release to Business Wire, for immediate release to national
newspapers and news wire services:

"KOLBENSCHMIDT AGREEMENT EXPIRES

"Dana Corporation today announced that its offer to acquire approximately 47%
of the shares of Kolbenschmidt AG from Metallgesellschaft AG has expired
without the parties having reached an agreement. The parties had originally
signed a Letter of Intent for this transaction in March, 1994.

"Southwood J. Morcott, Dana Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, 'Dana
continues to closely follow developments in connection with the ownership of
Kolbenschmidt and has a continuing interest in certain aspects of the
Kolbenschmidt business.'

"'Dana will also continue to look at other opportunities to pursue its
objectives of obtaining 50 percent of its sales from distribution markets and
50 percent of its sales from outside the U.S.,' he added.

"Dana Corporation, a Fortune 100 company, is a global leader in the
engineering, manufacturing, and marketing of products and systems for the
worldwide vehicular, industrial and mobile off-highway original equipment
markets and is a major supplier to the related aftermarkets. The company
manufactures and distributes drivetrain components, engine and chassis parts,
structural components, fluid power systems and power transmission products.
Dana also owns Dana Commercial Credit, a leading provider of lease financing
services.

"Dana, incorporated in 1905 and based in Toledo, Ohio, operates facilities in
27 countries with 36,000 people and sales of $5.5 billion in 1993."
