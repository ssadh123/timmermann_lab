H. F. AHMANSON & COMPANY

Subordinated Debt Securities

Underwriting Agreement

August 24, 1994

To the Representatives of the
several Underwriters named
in the respective Terms
Agreements hereinafter described

Dear Sirs:

1. Introductory. H. F. Ahmanson & Company, a Delaware corporation
(the "Issuer"), proposes to enter into one or more Terms Agreements (each, a
"Terms Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto with such additions and
deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and subject to the terms and
conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the Underwriters
named in the applicable Terms Agreement (such firms constituting the
"Underwriters" with respect to such Terms Agreement and the Securities specified
therein), the aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Debt Securities (the
"Securities"), of the Issuer specified in such Terms Agreement (with respect to
such Terms Agreement, the "Designated Securities").

The terms of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be
as specified in the Terms Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the
indenture ("Indenture") specified in the Terms Agreement.

Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to
time to the Underwriters of such Securities for whom firms designated as
representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Terms Agreement
relating thereto will act as Representatives (the "Representatives"). The term
"Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as the sole Representative
of the Underwriters and to Underwriters acting without any firm being designated
as their Representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as
an obligation on the part of the Issuer to sell any of the Securities or as an
obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The
obligation of the Issuer to issue and sell any of the Securities and the
obligation of any of the
<PAGE>

Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Terms
Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each
Terms Agreement shall specify the title of such Designated Securities, the
aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the price to the
public of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of
such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated
Securities and the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount
of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set
forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and
payment therefor. The Terms Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set
forth in the registration statement and prospectus related thereto) the terms of
such Designated Securities. A Terms Agreement shall be in the form of an
executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an
exchange of telegraphic communications or other rapid transmission device
designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted.

2. Representations and Warranties of the Issuer. The Issuer
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:

(a) The registration statement (No. 33-57218) relating to the
Securities (including a prospectus which, as supplemented, shall be used in
connection with sales of the Securities) has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("Commission"); and such registration statement and
each post-effective amendment thereto have been declared effective by the
Commission. The registration statement relating to Securities and the
Designated Securities in any offering hereunder, as amended at the time of
any Terms Agreement referred to in Section 1 and Section 3, is hereinafter
referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the prospectus as
supplemented as contemplated by Section 1 and Section 3 to reflect the
terms of the Designated Securities and terms of offering thereof, including
all material incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to
as the "Prospectus."

(b) On the effective date of the Registration Statement, such
Registration Statement conformed in all respects to the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933 ("Act") and the rules and regulations of the
Commission ("Rules and Regulations") and did not

2
<PAGE>

include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and on the date of each Terms Agreement referred to
in Section 1 and Section 3, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Act and the Rules
and Regulations and neither of such documents will include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that the foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any
such documents based upon written information furnished to the Issuer by
any Underwriter specifically for use therein.

3. Purchase and Offering. Upon the execution of the Terms Agreement
applicable to any Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives
of the release of such Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose
to offer the Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set
forth in the Prospectus. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the
Designated Securities shall be several and not joint. Unless otherwise
specified in the Terms Agreement, certificates representing Designated
Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to a Terms Agreement
relating thereto, in definitive form to the extent practicable, and in such
authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters
request upon at least two full business days' prior notice to the Issuer, shall
be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Representatives for the
account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its
behalf of the purchase price therefor by certified or official bank check or
checks payable to the order of the Issuer in the funds specified in such Terms
Agreement, all at the place and time and date specified in such Terms Agreement
or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Issuer
may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called a "Closing
Date" for such Designated Securities.

4. Covenants of the Issuer. The Issuer agrees with the several
Underwriters in connection with each offering of the Designated Securities:

(a) The Issuer will prepare the Prospectus and file such Prospectus
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the

3
<PAGE>

Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second
business day following the execution and delivery of each Terms Agreement,
or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 430A(a)(3)
under the Act, and will advise the Representatives promptly of such filing;
the Issuer will file timely all reports and any definitive proxy or
information statements required to be filed by the Issuer with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") for so long as the delivery of a
prospectus is required in connection with the offering of the Designated
Securities.

(b) The Issuer will advise the Representatives promptly of any
amendment or supplementation of the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus and will not effect such amendment or supplementation without
the consent of the Representatives (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, but shall not be deemed a waiver of any condition set forth in
Section 5 below); the Issuer will also advise the Representatives of the
institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of
the Registration Statement or of any part thereof, and will use its best
efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as
soon as possible its lifting, if issued.

(c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Designated
Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a
result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would
include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is
necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Issuer promptly will prepare and
file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such
statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.
The Underwriters agree to use the Prospectus, as so amended and
supplemented, in lieu of the Prospectus theretofore in effect.

(d) Not later than 18 months after the date of each Terms Agreement,
the Issuer will make generally available to its securityholders an earnings
statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after

4
<PAGE>

the date of such Terms Agreement which will satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Act.

(e) The Issuer will furnish to the Representatives copies of the
Registration Statement, including all exhibits, each preliminary prospectus
supplement, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to such
documents, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as are
reasonably requested.

(f) The Issuer will arrange for the qualification of the Designated
Securities for sale and the determination of their eligibility for
investment under the laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as
the Representatives designate and will continue such qualifications in
effect so long as required for the distribution of the Designated
Securities as contemplated by this Agreement; provided that the Issuer
shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a
general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.

(g) During a period of five years from the effective date of the
Registration Statement, to furnish to each Representative (i) as soon as
available, a copy of any report or definitive proxy statement of the Issuer
filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act and (ii) subject to
applicable law, from time to time, such other information concerning the
Issuer as the Representatives may reasonably request. To the extent such
information is specifically designated by the Issuer as confidential and is
not otherwise available to the public, you will not disseminate such
information unless required to do so by applicable law or legal or
administrative process.

(h) The Issuer will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the
fees, disbursements and expenses of the Issuer's counsel and accountants in
connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all
other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and amendments and
supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the
Underwriters and dealers; (ii) all expenses in connection with the
qualification of the Designated Securities for offering and sale under
state securities laws as provided in Section 4(f) hereof, including the
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters

5
<PAGE>

in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky
and legal investment surveys; (iii) any fees charged by securities rating
services for rating the Designated Securities at the request of the Issuer;
(iv) the filing fees incident to any required review by the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the
Designated Securities; (v) the cost of preparing note certificates; (vi)
the cost and charges of any depositary, transfer agent or registrar; and
(vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its
obligations hereunder and under the applicable Terms Agreement which are
not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood,
however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 7 and Section 9
hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses,
including the fees of their counsel, stock transfer taxes on resale of any
Designated Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with
any offers they may make.

(i) Without your prior written consent, the Issuer will not, during
the period beginning on the date of the Terms Agreement and continuing to
and including the last Closing Date for such Designated Securities or, if
later, the date of expiration of any option granted to the Underwriters by
the Issuer to purchase Designated Securities, offer, sell or agree to sell
or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Issuer which are
substantially similar to the Designated Securities without the prior
written consent of the Representatives.

5. Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters. The
obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Terms
Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the
discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and
warranties and other statements of the Issuer in or incorporated in the Terms
Agreement are, at and as of the relevant Closing Date, true and correct, the
condition that the Issuer shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder
and under the applicable Terms Agreement theretofore to be performed, and the
following additional conditions:

furnished to you such opinion or opinions, dated such Closing Date, with
respect to the incorporation of the Issuer, the validity of the Designated

matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel

request to enable them to pass upon such matters;

Indenture, constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the
Issuer subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights, and to general equity principles,
regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity;

(iii) Each of the Issuer and Home Savings has been duly qualified
as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in
good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it
owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require

jurisdiction;

(iv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, (A) the Issuer and

8
<PAGE>

known to such counsel of any governmental agency or body or any court
having jurisdiction over the Issuer or Home Savings or any of their
properties (provided that such counsel need not express any opinion in
this clause (A) with respect to the antifraud provisions of the
Federal securities laws, rules and regulations that are expressly
considered in other sections of its opinion, or with respect to state
securities or blue sky laws), (B) any agreement or instrument listed
as material to the Issuer or Home Savings on the officer's certificate
annexed to such opinion, to which the Issuer or Home Savings is a

material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Rules and
Regulations; the description in the Prospectus under the captions "H.

9
<PAGE>

Developments" and "Description of the Notes", of statutes, rules,

other documents described therein are accurate in all material
respects and fairly present the information required to be shown.

You shall have also received from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher a written
statement, dated the Closing Date, in the standard form of such counsel, to the
effect that, based on their participation in the preparation thereof, no facts
have come to the attention of such counsel that would lead them to believe that,
as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment or
supplement thereto made by the Issuer prior to such Closing Date (other than the
financial statements and related schedules and other financial or statistical
data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading

thereto made by the Issuer prior to such Closing Date (other than the financial
statements and related schedules and other financial or statistical data
therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading or that as of such Closing Date, the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the
Issuer prior to such Closing Date (other than the financial statements and
related schedules and other financial or statistical data therein, as to which
such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading; provided that such counsel may state
that the limitations inherent in their examination and the knowledge available
to them are such that they are unable to assume, and do not assume, any
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements
except for those statements under the captions "H. F. Ahmanson & Company" and
"Description of Debt Securities" in the Prospectus and "Recent Developments --
Regulatory Developments" and "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus
Supplement insofar as statutes, rules, regulations, contracts or other documents

documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or
required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus which are
not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;

(d) At each Closing Date, KPMG Peat Marwick shall have furnished to

delivery thereof, each in form and substance satisfactory to the
Representatives, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereof;

(e) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement,
there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development involving
a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or
properties of the Issuer or its subsidiaries which, in the judgment of the
Representatives, materially impairs the investment quality of the
Designated Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt
securities or preferred stock of the Issuer by any "nationally recognized
statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)
under the Act); (iii) neither Standard and Poor's Corporation nor Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. shall have publicly announced that it has under
surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its ratings of
any of the Issuer's debt securities or preferred stock; (iv) a suspension
or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York
Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such
exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Issuer on
any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (v) a general moratorium on
commercial banking activities in New York or California declared by either
Federal or applicable state authorities; or (vi) the outbreak or escalation
of major hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the
United States of a national emergency or war, if the effect of any such
event specified in Clauses (i) or (vi) in the judgment of the
Representatives makes it impracticable to proceed with the public offering
or the delivery of the Designated Securities being delivered on such
Closing Date on the

11
<PAGE>

terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus; and

(f) The Issuer shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the
Representatives at such Closing Date certificates of the President or any
Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the
Issuer which shall state that to the best of their knowledge after
reasonable investigation in their capacity as officers of the Issuer (i)
the representations and warranties of the Issuer herein and in the Terms
Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities at and as of such
Closing Date are true and correct, (ii) the Issuer has complied in all
material respects with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its
part to be performed or satisfied hereunder and under the applicable Terms
Agreement at or prior to such Closing Date, (iii) the matters set forth in
subsection (a) (regarding a suspension of effectiveness) of this Section
are true and correct and (iv) there has been no change, or any development
involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business
or properties of the Issuer or its subsidiaries which materially impairs
the investment quality of the Designated Securities.

6. Conditions to the Obligations of the Issuer. The obligation of
the Issuer to issue and sell any Designated Securities under a Terms Agreement
shall be subject to (i) the performance by the Underwriters in all material
respects of their respective obligations hereunder; and (ii) the condition
precedent that prior to the Closing Date no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no
proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of
the Issuer or any Underwriter, contemplated by the Commission.

7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Issuer will indemnify
and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject,
under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto
or any related preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact

12
<PAGE>

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred as such expenses are incurred by such Underwriter in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim, such amounts to be repaid
by such Underwriter if and to the extent it shall be determined ultimately that
such Underwriter was not entitled to such amounts under the provisions of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable in any such
case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any
such amendment or supplement or any related preliminary prospectus supplement in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer
by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and
provided, further, that the Issuer shall not be liable to any Underwriter under
the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any untrue
statement or omission in any preliminary prospectus supplement to the extent
that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from
the fact such Underwriter sold Designated Securities to a person to whom there
was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a
copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by
reference) in any case where such delivery is required if the Issuer has
previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter and the loss, claim,
damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or
omission of a material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus supplement
or the Prospectus, as the case may be, which was corrected in the Prospectus (or
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented).

(b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and
hold harmless the Issuer against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to
which the Issuer may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto or any preliminary prospectus supplement, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material

13
<PAGE>

fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in
each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any
preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or
supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Issuer by such Underwriter expressly for use therein, and will reimburse
the Issuer for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred as such expenses
are incurred by the Issuer in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim, such amounts to be repaid by the Issuer if and to the
extent it shall be determined ultimately that the Issuer was not entitled to
such amounts under the provisions of this Agreement.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection
(a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. In case
any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall
notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall
wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume
the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who
shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the
indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such
subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in
each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each

14
<PAGE>

indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Issuer on the one hand and the Underwriters on
the other from the offering of the Designated Securities. If, however, the
allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by
applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required
under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to
such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Issuer on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Issuer on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be
in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before
deducting expenses) received by the Issuer as set forth in the table on the
cover page of the Prospectus bear to the total underwriting discounts and
commissions received by the Underwriters as set forth in the table on the cover
page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Issuer on the one hand or the Underwriters on the
other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Issuer and
the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the Designated Securities

15
<PAGE>

underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public
exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in
proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.

(e) The obligations of the Issuer under this Section 7 shall be in
addition to any liability which the Issuer may otherwise have and shall extend,
upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the
Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which
the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same
terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Issuer and to each
person, if any, who controls the Issuer within the meaning of the Act.

8. Default of Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in
its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to
purchase under a Terms Agreement at a Closing Date, the Representatives shall
use reasonable efforts to arrange for another party or other parties to purchase
such Designated Securities, or the Representatives may in their discretion
purchase such Designated Securities, on the terms contained herein. If within
thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do
not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Issuer
shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to
procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to
purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within
the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Issuer that
the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated
Securities, or the Issuer notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged
for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the
Issuer shall have the right to postpone such Closing Date for a period of not
more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made
necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other
documents or arrangements, and the Issuer agrees to file promptly any amendments
to the

16
<PAGE>

Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives'
reasonable opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as
used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section
with like effect as if such person had originally been made a party to this
Agreement or a Terms Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.

(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of
the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Issuer as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remain unpurchased
does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the
Designated Securities to be purchased at such Closing Date, then the Issuer
shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the
principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to
purchase hereunder on such Closing Date and, in addition, to require each non-
defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal
amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase
hereunder) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein
shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of
the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Issuer as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remain unpurchased
exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities
to be purchased on such Closing Date, or if the Issuer shall not exercise the
right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters
to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters,
then this Agreement and the Terms Agreement with respect to the Designated
Securities and any obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Issuer
to sell the Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability
on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Issuer, except for the
expenses to be borne by the Issuer and the Underwriters as provided in the first
sentence of Section 4(h) hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in
Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from
liability for its default.

17
<PAGE>

9. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The
respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other
statements of the Issuer and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this
Agreement and the Terms Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities or
made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement and the
Terms Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities, shall remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the
results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling
person of any Underwriter, or the Issuer, or any officer or director or
controlling person of the Issuer, and shall survive delivery of and payment for
the Designated Securities.

If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 6(i),
Section 5(e)(iii), (iv) (only with regards to a suspension or material
limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange,
or the setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange), (v) or (vi) or
Section 8 hereof, the Issuer shall not then be under any liability to any
Underwriter except as provided in the first sentence of Section 4(h) and Section
7 hereof; but, if for any other reason the Designated Securities are not
delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer as provided in the applicable Terms
Agreement, the Issuer will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket
expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making
preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Designated Securities,
but the Issuer shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter
except as provided in Section 4(h) and Section 7 hereof.

10. Notices. In all dealings under a Terms Agreement, the
Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters of such
Designated Securities, and the parties to any Terms Agreement shall be entitled
to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of
any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives on behalf of the
Underwriters.

All statements, requests, notices, and agreements hereunder and under
any Terms Agreement shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in
writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if
delivered or sent by registered mail to the Representatives at their address set
forth in the applicable Terms Agreement; and if to the Issuer shall be
sufficient in all

18
<PAGE>

respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to 4900 Rivergrade Road,
Irwindale, California 91706, Attention: General Counsel; provided, however,
that the Representatives agree to use reasonable efforts to advise orally
Charles R. Rinehart, Kevin M. Twomey or George G. Gregory of the mailing or
transmission of any such notice concurrently with such mailing or transmission,
but the failure to advise any of the foregoing individuals of any such notice
shall not invalidate such notice; and provided, further, that any notice to an
Underwriter pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by
registered mail to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its
Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which
address will be supplied to the Issuer by the Representatives upon request. Any
such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt
thereof.

11. Successors. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters of Designated Securities, the Issuer
and, to the extent provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof, the officers and
directors of the Issuer and each person who controls the Issuer or any such
Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors
and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by
virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from
any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such
purchase.

12. Time. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used
herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office
in Washington, D.C. is open for business.

13. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

19
<PAGE>

14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Very truly yours,

H. F. AHMANSON & COMPANY

ANNEX II

Pursuant to Section 5(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants
shall furnish a letter or letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:

(i) They are independent certified public accountants with respect to
the Issuer and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the Rules
and Regulations;

(ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary
financial information and schedules audited (and, if applicable,
prospective financial statements and/or pro forma financial information
examined) by them and included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and the Rules and Regulations; and they have
made a review in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim
financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial
information, prospective financial statements and/or condensed financial
statements derived from audited financial statements of the Issuer for the
periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon,
copies of which have been furnished to the representatives of the
Underwriters (the "Representatives");

(iii) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a
reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information
referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial
statements of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute
books of the Issuer and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest
audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Issuer and its subsidiaries
responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries
and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their
attention that caused them to believe that:

(A) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income,
consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows
included

<PAGE>

or incorporated by reference in the Issuer's Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the
Rules and Regulations or are not in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with
the basis for the audited consolidated statements of income,
consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows
included or incorporated by reference in the Issuer's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;

(B) any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet
items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding
items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which
such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and
items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the
basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Issuer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;

(C) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do
not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations or
the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the
historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;

(D) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the
date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated
capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of
options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance
shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case
which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any
increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated

2
<PAGE>

stockholders' equity, total deposits or total assets, or changes in
allowance for possible loan losses or other items specified by the
Representatives, or any increases in Federal Home Loan Bank advances
or any other items specified by the Representatives, in each case as
compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for
changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have
occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and

(E) for the period from the date of the latest financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to
the specified date referred to in Clause (D) there were any decreases
in consolidated net interest income, consolidated noninterest income
or total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other
items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items
specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the
comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of
corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each
case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have
occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and

(iv) In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included
or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures,
inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in
paragraph (iii) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures,
not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial
information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the
general accounting records of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, which appear
in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in
Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement
specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference
in the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared
certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the
accounting records of the Issuer

3
<PAGE>

and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.

All references in this Annex II to the Prospectus shall be deemed to
refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference
therein) as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated
Securities at the Closing Date for such Designated Securities.

such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one
or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify
or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based,
insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or
representations by, counsel, unless

11
<PAGE>

such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the
certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which
his or her certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate
or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters,
upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers
of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters
is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the
exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or
representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other
instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and
form one instrument.

Section 104. Acts of Holders; Record Dates.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by
Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of
substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly
appointed in writing. If Securities of a series are issuable in whole or in
part as Bearer Securities, any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given
or taken by Holders may, alternatively, be embodied in and evidenced by the
record of Holders of Securities voting in favor thereof, either in person or by
proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders of Securities duly
called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article Sixteen, or a
combination of such instruments and any such record. Except as herein otherwise
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly
required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action
embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the
"Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution
of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601)
conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner
provided in this Section.

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by
law to take acknowledgments of

12
<PAGE>

deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing
acknowledged to him or her the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a
signer acting in a capacity other than his or her individual capacity, such
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his or her
authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved
in any other manner that the Trustee deems sufficient.

The ownership of Registered Securities shall be proved by the Security
Register.

The principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by
any Person, and the date of holding the same, may be proved by the production of
such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed, as Depositary, by any trust
company, bank, banker or other depositary, wherever situated, if such
certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory, showing that as
of the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such Depositary,
or exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities in the amount and with the serial
numbers therein described, or such facts may be proved by the certificate or
affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer Securities, if such certificate or
affidavit is deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. The Trustee of the
Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until
(1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of
the same Bearer Security is produced, (2) such Bearer Security is produced to
the Trustee by some other Person, (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in
exchange for a Registered Security, or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer
Outstanding.

The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing, the
authority of the Person executing the same and the principal amount and serial
numbers of Bearer Securities held by the Person so executing such instrument or
writing and the date of holding the same may also be proved in any other manner
that the Trustee deems sufficient, and the Trustee may in any instance require
further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section
104.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the
same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of
transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of
anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in
reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such
Security.

13
<PAGE>

The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture
Act, set any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders
of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give or take any request,
demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of
Securities of such series. If not set by the Company prior to the first
solicitation of a Holder of Outstanding Securities of such series made by any
Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to
such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day
(or, if later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be
provided pursuant to Section 701) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as
the case may be. With regard to any record date set pursuant to this paragraph,
the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date
(or their duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to
give or take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders
after such record date.

Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to give or
take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with
regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or
more duly appointed agents each of whom may do so pursuant to such appointment
with regard to all or any different part of such principal amount.

Section 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to
be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing
to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate
Trust Department, or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if
in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company
addressed to it to the attention of its Treasurer at the address of its
principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at
any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the
Company.

14
<PAGE>

Section 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such
notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided)
if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected
by such event, at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register, not
later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if
any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to
Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any
defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the
sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Notice shall be
sufficiently given to Holders of Bearer Securities if published in an Authorized
Newspaper in the City of New York and in such other city or cities as may be
specified in the Securities on at least two Business Days, the first such
publication to be not earlier than the earliest date, and not later than the
latest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. Where this Indenture
provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the
Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by
Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a
condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by
reason of any other cause it shall be impractical to give such notice by mail,
then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall
constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

In case by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized
Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be
impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided
above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given
with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such
Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to give notice by
publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided, nor any defect in any
notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of
Registered Securities given as provided herein.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English
language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the
country of publication.

Section 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a
provision of the Trust Indenture Act that is required under such Act to be a
part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any
provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust
Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be
deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case
may be.

Section 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are
for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

Section 109. Successors and Assigns.

All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall
bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

Section 110. Separability Clause.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Section 111. Benefits of Indenture.

Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied,
shall give to any Person (including any Paying Agent or Authenticating Agent
appointed pursuant to Section 614), other than the parties hereto and their
successors hereunder, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, any
benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

Section 112. Governing Law.

This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of New York, but without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws.

16
<PAGE>

Section 113. Legal Holidays.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date,
Repurchase Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day
at any Place of Payment (or the City in which the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee is located), then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture
or of the Securities (other than a provision of the Securities of any series
that specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this
Section)) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be
made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment (provided such Business Day is
a Business Day in the City in which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee is
located) with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date,
Redemption Date, Repurchase Date or at the Stated Maturity; provided, however,
that no interest shall accrue on the unpaid interest segment for the period from
and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repurchase Date or Stated
Maturity, as the case may be.

Section 203. Form of Reverse of Security.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more
series under an Indenture, dated as of August 24, 1994 and all indentures
supplemental thereto (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and
The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee",
which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which
Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is
one of the series designated on the face hereof [if applicable, insert --,
limited in aggregate principal amount to $_____________].

The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided
in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Security is issued subject
to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this
Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take
such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination
so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his or her attorney-in-fact for any and
all such purposes.

[If applicable, insert -- The Securities of this series are subject to
redemption upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, (1) on
____________ in any year commencing with the year ____ and ending with the year
____ through operation of the sinking fund for this series at the Redemption
Prices for redemption through operation of the sinking fund (expressed as
percentages of the principal amount) set forth in the table below, and (2) at
any time [if applicable, insert -- on or after _____________], as a whole or in
part, at the election of the Company, at the Redemption Prices for redemption

and thereafter at a Redemption Price equal to ____% of the principal amount,
together in the case of any such redemption (whether through operation of the
sinking fund or otherwise) with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, but
interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption
Date will be payable [upon presentation and surrender of coupons for such
interest] [to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor
Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates
referred to on the face hereof,] all as provided in the Indenture.]

[If applicable, insert -- Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
may not, prior to __________ redeem any Securities of this series as
contemplated by [if applicable, --Clause (2) of] the preceding paragraph as a
part of, or in anticipation of, any refunding operation by the application,
directly or indirectly, of moneys borrowed having an interest cost to the
Company (calculated in accordance with generally accepted financial practice) of
less than _____% per annum.]

[The sinking fund for this series provides for the redemption on
____________ in each year beginning with the year _____ and ending with the year
_______ of [if applicable, -- not less than $___________ ("mandatory sinking
fund") and not more than] $_________ aggregate principal amount of Securities of
this series. Securities of this series acquired or redeemed by the Company
otherwise than through [if applicable, -- mandatory] sinking fund payments may
be credited against subsequent [if applicable, -- mandatory] sinking fund
payments otherwise required to be made [if applicable, -- in the inverse order
in which they become due].]

[If the Security is subject to redemption or conversion in part of any
kind, insert -- In the event of [redemption] [or] [conversion] of this Security
in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for
the [unredeemed] [or] [unconverted] portion hereof will be issued in the name of
the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.]

[If the Security is subject to conversion, insert --Subject to and
upon compliance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this
Security is entitled, at his or her option, at any time on or before the close
of business on _____________, or in case this Security or a portion hereof is
called for redemption, then in respect of this Security or such

22
<PAGE>

portion hereof until and including, but (unless the Company defaults in making
the payment due upon redemption or repurchase) not after, the close of business
on the Redemption Date or the repurchase date, to convert this Security (or any
portion of the principal amount hereof which is $_________ or an integral
multiple thereof), at the principal amount hereof, or of such portion, into
fully paid and non-assessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the
nearest 1/100 of a share) of Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price
equal to $__________ aggregate principal amount of Securities for each share of
Common Stock (or at the current adjusted conversion price if an adjustment has
been made as provided in the Indenture) by surrender of this Security, duly
endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank, to the Company at its office or
agency in [Los Angeles, California] [New York, New York,] [or to such office or
agency outside the United States as the Company may designate] accompanied by
[all unmatured coupons and any matured coupons in default attached hereto and]
written notice to the Company that (i) the Holder hereof elects to convert this
Security, or if less than the entire principal amount hereof is to be converted,
the portion hereof to be converted, and (ii) the name or names (with addresses)
in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock issuable on
such conversion shall be issued. [In case such surrender shall be made during
the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date next preceding
any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment
Date (unless this Security or the portion thereof being converted has been
called for redemption, or is to be repurchased, on such Interest Payment Date or
on a Redemption Date or a repurchase date within such period), this Security
shall also accompanied by payment in New York Clearing House or other funds
acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the interest payable on such
Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of this Security then being
converted (or, if this Security was issued in exchange for a Bearer Security
after the close of business on such Regular Record Date, by surrender of one or
more coupons relating to such Interest Payment Date or by both payment in such
funds and surrender of such coupon or coupons, in either case, in an amount
equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal
amount of this Security then being converted).] [Subject to the aforesaid
requirement for payment and, in the case of a conversion after the Regular
Record Date next preceding any Interest Payment Date and on or before such
Interest Payment Date, to the right of the Holder of this Security (or any
Predecessor Security) of record at such Regular Record Date to receive an
installment of interest (with certain exceptions provided in the Indenture),] no
payment or adjustment is to be made on conversion for interest accrued hereon or
for dividends on the Common Stock issued on conversion. No fractions of shares
or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on

23
<PAGE>

conversion, but instead of any fractional interest the Company shall pay a cash
adjustment as provided in the Indenture. The conversion price is subject to
adjustment as provided in the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture provides
that in case of certain consolidations or mergers to which the Company is a
party or the transfer of substantially all of the assets of the Company, the
Indenture shall be amended, without the consent of any Holders of Securities, so
that this Security, if then outstanding, will be convertible thereafter during
the period this Security shall be convertible as specified above, only into the
kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon the
consolidation, merger or transfer by a Holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock into which this Security might have been converted immediately prior to
such consolidation, merger or transfer (assuming such holder of Common Stock
failed to exercise any rights of election and received per share the kind and
amount received per share by a plurality of non-electing shares).]

[If applicable, insert -- The Indenture contains provisions for
defeasance at any time of (1) the entire indebtedness of this Security or (2)
certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this
Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the
Indenture.]

[If the Security is not an Original Issue Discount Security, insert --
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and
be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared
due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.]

[If the Security is an Original Issue Discount Security, insert -- If
an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be
continuing, an amount of principal of the Securities of this series may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture. Such amount shall be equal to --insert formula for determining the
amount. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable
and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case
to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable),
all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of
and interest, if any, on the Securities of this series shall terminate.]

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the

24
<PAGE>

Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time
Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the
Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company
with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of
this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration
of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not
notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the
Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount
of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written
request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of
Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee
shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with
such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60
days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The
foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security
for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or

31
<PAGE>

If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken

Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.

The Securities shall be subordinated in right of payment to Senior
Indebtedness as provided in Article Fifteen. The Securities shall not be
superior in right of payment to, and shall rank pari passu with, the Company's

Section 302. Denominations.

The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in the form and
in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. In
the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of
any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of
$1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.

Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.

The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its
Chairman of the Board, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or one of
its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its
Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these
officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.

Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals
who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of
this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any Series together with
any coupons relating thereto executed by the Company to the Trustee for
authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and
delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company
Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; provided, however, that,
in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security or coupon shall be
mailed or otherwise delivered (i) to any person who is not a United States Alien
or to any location in the United States, (ii) unless the Company shall have
received such certificates required by Section

32
<PAGE>

311 or Section 301 hereof, and (iii) unless the Company has no reason to know
that such certificates are false.

If the form or terms of the Securities of the series and any related
coupons have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as
permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and
accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to
such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to
Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel
stating,

(1) if the forms of such Securities and any coupons has been
established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201,
that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of
this Indenture;

(2) if the terms of such Securities and any coupons have been
established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301,
that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of
this Indenture; and

(3) that such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining
thereto, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the
Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such
Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations
of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to general equity principles.

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be
required to authenticate such Securities if the issuance of such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that
is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding
paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one
time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise
required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel
otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time
of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are
delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first
Security of such series to be

33
<PAGE>

issued. After any such first delivery, any separate request by the Company that
the Trustee authenticate Securities of such series for original issue will be
deemed to be a certification by the Company that all conditions precedent
provided for in this Indenture relating to the authentication and delivery of
such Securities continue to be complied with.

Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its
authentication. Unless otherwise specified in Section 301, each Bearer Security
(including a Bearer Security represented by a temporary Global Security) shall
be dated as of the date of original issuance of the first Security of such
series to be issued.

No Security or coupon attached thereto shall be entitled to any
benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless
there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in
the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and
such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only
evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered
hereunder. Except as otherwise permitted by this Indenture, the Trustee shall
not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all pertinent coupons
for interest then matured have been detached and cancelled. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder
but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such
Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all
purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the
benefits of this Indenture.

Section 304. Temporary Securities.

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the
Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they
are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as
evidenced by their execution of such Securities.

Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and
authenticated by the Trustee and registered by the Security Registrar, upon the
same conditions, and with like effect, as a definitive Security.

34
<PAGE>

Except in the case of Securities represented by a temporary Global
Security (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the
three succeeding paragraphs), if temporary Securities of any series are issued,
the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared
without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of
such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for
definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities
of such series (accompanied by any unmatured coupons appertaining thereto) at
the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series,
without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or
more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more
definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of
a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, except that no definitive Bearer
Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security.
Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects
be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities
of such series and tenor.

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, if Bearer
Securities of any series are represented by a temporary Global Security, any
such temporary Global Security shall be delivered to the Depositary for the
benefit of Euro-clear and Cedel S.A., for credit to the respective accounts of
the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may
direct).

Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date
specified in or determined pursuant to the terms of any such temporary Global
Security (the "Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee
permanent Securities of the same series, in aggregate principal amount equal to
the principal amount of such temporary Global Security, executed by the Company.
On or after the Exchange Date, such temporary Global Security shall be
surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such
purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for permanent
Securities of the same series and of like tenor without charge and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary
Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of
the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of
such temporary Global Security to be exchanged. The permanent Securities to be
delivered in exchange for any such temporary Global Security shall be in
definitive bearer form or registered from, or shall be represented by a
permanent Global Security, or any combination thereof, as specified as
contemplated by Section 301, and, if any

35
<PAGE>

combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial owner
thereof.

Unless otherwise specified in any such temporary Global Security, the
interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series represented by such
temporary Global Security shall be exchanged for permanent Securities of the
same series and of like tenor following the Exchange Date when the account
holder instructs Euro-clear or Cedel S.A., as the case may be, to request such
exchange on his behalf and delivers to Euro-clear or Cedel S.A., as the case may
be, any certificate specified as contemplated by Sections 301 and 311. Unless
otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security, any such exchange shall
be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary Global
Security, except that a person receiving permanent Securities must bear the cost
of insurance, postage, transportation and the like in the event that such person
does not take delivery of such permanent Securities in person at the offices of
Euro-clear or Cedel S.A.

Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary
Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as permanent Securities of the same series and of like
tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on a temporary Global
Security representing a series of Bearer Securities on an Interest Payment Date
for Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date
shall be payable to Euro-clear and Cedel S.A. on such Interest Payment Date,
upon delivery by Euro-clear and Cedel S.A. to the Trustee of any certificate
specified as contemplated by Section 301, for credit without further interest on
or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the persons
who are the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Security on such Interest
Payment Date and who have each delivered to Euro-clear or Cedel S.A., as the
case may be, any certificate specified as contemplated by Sections 301 and 311.

Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer
and Exchange.

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of
the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other
office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes
collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the
registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is
hereby appointed "Security Registrar"

36
<PAGE>

for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein
provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any
series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of
the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
principal amount and tenor.

At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may
be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series, of any
authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor,
upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office or
agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company
shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities
that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be
duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the
Holder thereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than
exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.

The Company shall not be required (1) to issue, register the transfer
of Securities of any series to be redeemed during a period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing or publication, as
applicable, of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for
redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of
such mailing, (2) to register the transfer of any Security so selected for
redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security
being redeemed in part, or

37
<PAGE>

(3) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such
Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of like tenor and
terms of that series, provided that such Registered Security shall be
simultaneously surrendered for exemption.

At the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be
exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized
denomination or denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and
tenor, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such
office or agency, with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default
thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce
any such unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default,
such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by a
payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to
the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such
missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and Trustee if there is
furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of
them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer
Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect
of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to
receive the amount of such payment; provided, however, that except as otherwise
provided in this Indenture, interest represented by coupons shall be payable
only upon presentation and surrender of such coupons at an office or agency
located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a
Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in
exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and like tenor after the
close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and
before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest
Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business
at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted
Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating
to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be,
and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on
such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in
respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security,
but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance
with the provisions of this Indenture.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global
Security may be transferred to, or registered or exchanged for Securities
registered in the name of, any Person other than the Depositary for such Global
Security or any nominee thereof, and no such transfer may be registered, unless
(1) such

38
<PAGE>

Depositary (A) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue
as Depositary for such Global Security or (B) ceases to be a clearing agency
registered under the Exchange Act, (2) the Company executes and delivers to the
Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so transferable,
registrable and exchangeable, and such transfers shall be registrable, (3) there
shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the
Securities evidenced by such Global Security or (4) there shall exist such other
circumstances, if any, as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated
by Section 301. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, a Global
Security to which the restriction set forth in the preceding sentence shall have
ceased to apply may be transferred only to, and may be registered and exchanged
for Securities registered only in the name or names of, such Person or Persons
as the Depositary for such Global Security shall have directed, and no transfer
thereof other than such a transfer may be registered.

If at any time the Depositary for a Global Security notifies the
Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global
Security or if at any time the Depositary for a Global Security ceases to be a
clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, at a time when such Depositary is required to be so registered in order
to act as a Depositary, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with
respect to such Global Security. If a successor Depositary for such Global
Security is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Company
receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication
and delivery of definitive Debt Securities, shall authenticate and deliver Debt
Securities in definitive registered form in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global
Security.

The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that
the Debt Securities issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no
longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication
and delivery of definitive Securities, shall authenticate and deliver, Debt
Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in any authorized
denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of
the Global Security, in exchange for such Global Security.

Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of
transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security to which the
restriction set forth in the first

39
<PAGE>

sentence of the preceding paragraph shall apply, whether pursuant to this
Section, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1107 or otherwise, shall be authenticated,
registered and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the exchange of
Bearer Securities into Registered Securities shall be subject to applicable laws
and regulations in effect at the time of exchange. Neither the Company, the
Trustee nor the Security Registrar shall exchange any Bearer Securities into
Registered Securities if it has received an Opinion of Counsel that as a result
of such exchanges the Company would suffer adverse consequences under the United
States Federal income tax laws and regulations then in effect and the Company
has delivered to the Trustee a Company Order directing the Trustee not to make
such exchanges thereafter, unless and until the Trustee receives a subsequent
Company Order to the contrary. The Company shall deliver copies of such Company
Order to the Security Registrar.

Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen
Securities or Coupons.

If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon
appertaining thereto is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute
and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new
Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a
number not contemporaneously outstanding.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i)
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security
and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of
them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to
the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security (and mutilated
coupon, if applicable), a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and
principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or
coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or coupon;
provided, however, that the interest on any Bearer Security shall be payable
only at an office or agency located outside the United States and only upon
presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto (unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301).

40
<PAGE>

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and the Trustee) connected
therewith.

Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in
lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a
Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains,
shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company,
whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its
coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this
Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that
series and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.

Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security that is
payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest.

In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for
a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office
or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Regular Record Date and
before the opening of business on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date,
such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such
Interest Payment Date and interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment
Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer
Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in
accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Any interest on any Registered Security of any series that is payable,
but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
(herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder,
and

41
<PAGE>

such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to
the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business
on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which
shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the
Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid
on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and
at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of
money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such
Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when
deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to
such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee
shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest
that shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the
date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by
the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall
promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name
and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed
payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to
be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of
such series at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register,
not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date
therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to
the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business
on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the
following Clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with
the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be
listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after
notice is given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment
pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable
by the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security
delivered under this Indenture upon registration of

42
<PAGE>

transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the
rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such
other Security.

In the case of any Security that is converted after any Regular Record
Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than
any Security whose Maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest
shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion,
and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be
paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in
the case of any Security that is converted, interest after the date of
conversion of such Security shall not be payable.

Section 308. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the
owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of
principal of and any premium and (except as contemplated by Section 301(3) and
subject to Section 307) any interest on such Registered Security and for all
other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security is overdue, and neither
the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons appertaining thereto
shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any
coupon as the absolute owner of such Bearer Security or coupon for the purpose
of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Bearer Security or coupon be overdue, and
neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee
shall be effected by notice to the contrary.

None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security
Registrar shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

43

Section 309. Cancellation.

All Securities or coupons surrendered for payment, redemption,
registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund
payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered
to the Trustee and all Registered Securities and matured coupons so delivered
shall be promptly cancelled by it. All Bearer Securities and unmatured coupons
so delivered shall be held by the Trustee and, upon instruction by a Company
Order, shall be cancelled or held for reissuance. Bearer Securities and
unmatured coupons held for reissuance may be reissued only in replacement of
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Bearer Securities of the same series and
like tenor or the related coupon, pursuant to Section 306. All Bearer
Securities and unmatured coupons held by the Trustee pending such cancellation
or reissuance shall be deemed to be delivered for cancellation for all purposes
of this Indenture and the Securities. The Company may at any time deliver to
the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the
Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder that
the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be
promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu
of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section,
except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held
by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order.

Section 310. Computation of Interest.

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Section 311. Certificate by a Person Entitled to
Delivery of a Bearer Security.

Whenever any provision of this Indenture contemplates that a Person
shall be entitled to delivery of a Bearer Security, no delivery of such Bearer
Security shall be made unless and until the Company shall have received
certification substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 and, if applicable,
Exhibit A-2 and Exhibit B hereto, with only such changes as shall be approved by
the Company then consented to by the Trustee whose consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and any additional certification as

44
<PAGE>

may be required pursuant to United States Department of Treasury regulations.

"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of
any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article
Fifteen or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or
pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or

series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days
after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company
by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least
25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a
written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be

under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or
evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or Home
Savings (including this Indenture) having an aggregate principal amount
outstanding of at least $10,000,000, whether such indebtedness now exists
or shall hereafter be created, which default shall constitute a failure to
pay any portion of the principal of such indebtedness when due and payable
after the expiration of any applicable grace period with respect thereto or
shall have resulted in such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and
payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and
payable, without such indebtedness having been discharged, or such
acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, within a period of 35 days
after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the
Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of
at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that
series a written notice specifying such default and requiring the Company
to cause such indebtedness to be discharged or cause such acceleration to

or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the
Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition
seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in
respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or state law, or
appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,
sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial
part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its
affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any
such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60
consecutive days; or

(7) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding
under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency,

case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of
any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing
by

48
<PAGE>

it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief
under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the
filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a
custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other
similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property,
or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as
they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in
furtherance of any such action; or

(8) any other Event of Default or variations in the foregoing Events
of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.

Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission
and Annulment.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series
at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case
the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or,
if any of the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount
Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may
be specified in the terms thereof) of all of the Securities of that series
to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company
(and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration
such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due
and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect
to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree
for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as
hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written
notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such
declaration and its consequences if

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of
that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration and any

49
<PAGE>

interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such
Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in
such Securities,

and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series,
other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series
that has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been
cured or waived as provided in Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits
for Enforcement by Trustee.

The Company covenants that if

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security
when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a
period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such
Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue
principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further
amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection,
including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee may in its

50
<PAGE>

discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as
the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce
any other proper remedy.

Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any
other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act
in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such
proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and
receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee,
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the
Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such
payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 607.

No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of
a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder of a Security
or coupon thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of
any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such proceeding; provided, however,
that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a
trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or
other similar committee.

Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without
Possession of Securities.

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities
may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of
the Securities or coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating
thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in
its

51
<PAGE>

own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,
after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the
ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities and any coupons in respect of
which such judgment has been recovered.

Section 506. Application of Money Collected.

Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be
applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and,
in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium
or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the
payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section
607; and

SECOND: Subject to Article Fifteen, to the payment of the amounts
then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the
Securities and interest evidenced by coupons in respect of which or for the
benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference
or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such
Securities and coupons first for any premium and interest, and second, for
any principal, respectively.

The Holders of each series of Securities denominated in ECU, any other
composite currency or a Foreign Currency and any matured coupons relating
thereto shall be entitled to receive a ratable portion of the amount determined
by the Exchange Rate Agent by converting the principal amount Outstanding of
such series of Securities and matured but unpaid interest on such series of
Securities in the currency in which such series of Securities is denominated
into Dollars at the Exchange Rate as of the date of declaration of acceleration
of Maturity of the Securities.

Section 507. Limitation on Suits.

No Holder of any Security of any series or any related coupons shall
have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect
to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any
other remedy hereunder, unless

52
<PAGE>

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of
a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that
series;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to
the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in
its own name as Trustee hereunder;

(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in
compliance with such request in such amount as shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request
and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given
to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of
such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such
Holders.

Section 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive
Principal, Premium and Interest and
to Convert.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Security or coupon shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and
(except as contemplated by Section 301(3) and subject to Section 307) interest
on such Security or payment of such coupon on the respective Stated Maturities
expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on the
Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment
and, if provided in Section 301, the right to convert such Security in
accordance with Article Thirteen and to institute suit for its enforcement,

53
<PAGE>

and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

Section 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce
any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and
thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue
as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

Section 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons in the
last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall
not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate
right or remedy.

Section 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities
or coupons to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default
shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event
of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to
time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders,
as the case may be.

Section 512. Control by Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding

54
<PAGE>

for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series,
provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
with this Indenture, and

(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee
that is not inconsistent with such direction.

Section 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of any series may, on behalf of the Holders of
all the Securities of such series and any related coupons, waive any past
default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except
a default

(1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on
any Security of such series, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that under Article
Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 514. Undertaking for Costs.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or

THE TRUSTEE

Section 601. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,

(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties
as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants

are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall
be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they
conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

(b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the

Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his
own affairs.

(c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that

subsection (a) of this Section;

56
<PAGE>

Securities of such series.

No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise incur any personal financial liability in the performance

powers, if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not

respect to the Securities of any series when, as and to the extent provided by

suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other
evidence is herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad
faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;

such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

(5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction
of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall
have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the
costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance
with such request or direction;

facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,

document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry
or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the
Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it
shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the
Company, personally or by agent or attorney upon reasonable advance written

expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in
accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable

except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to
its negligence or bad faith; and

59
<PAGE>

(3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of the trust or trusts hereunder or performance of its duties hereunder,
including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or
liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its
powers or duties hereunder.

The obligations of the Company under this Section shall not be
subordinated to the payment of Senior Indebtedness pursuant to Article
Fifteen. As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company
under this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to the Securities
upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such,
except funds held in trust for the payment of principal of (and premium, if

the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate
such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and
subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture
and the Company shall take prompt action to have a successor Trustee
appointed in the manner provided herein. Nothing herein shall prevent the

or any equivalent successor provision.

Section 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

(iii) is subject to supervision or examination by federal, state or
District of Columbia authority, and (iv) has a Corporate Trust Office in
the City of New York, New York. If such Person publishes reports of

supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section,
the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so

60
<PAGE>

published. Neither the Company nor any person directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Company may
serve as Trustee. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

Section 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment
of Successor.

No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a

acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 611.

The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities
of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If
the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611
shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the
giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition
any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the
Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the
Trustee and to the Company.

If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written
request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder of a Security for at least six months, or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall
fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such
Holder, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged
a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property
shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of
the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the
Trustee with respect to all securities, or (B) subject

61
<PAGE>

to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at
least six months may, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly
situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the
Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor
Trustee or Trustees.

If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting,
or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect
to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution,
shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor
Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of
such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to
the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable
requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation,
removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of any Series shall be appointed by Act of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such
series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee
so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent
supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of any Series shall have been so
appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner
required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and
all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series.

The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of
the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of
a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders
of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice
shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities
of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

Section 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request
of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon
payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and
shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property
and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the
retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and that (1) shall
contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall
contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by
any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental
indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or

63
<PAGE>

any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and
deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring
Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to
which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.

Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute
any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming
to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to herein.

No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time
of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article.

Section 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation
or Succession to Business.

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
In the event any Securities shall not have been authenticated by such
predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver
such Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with
the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of
authentication of the Trustee.

Section 613. Preferential Collection of Claims
Against Company.

If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company
(or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against
the Company (or any such other obligor).

64
<PAGE>

Section 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect
to one or more series of Securities or coupons that shall be authorized to act
on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series or any
related coupons issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of
transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and
Securities or coupons so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated
by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the
authentication and delivery of Securities or coupons by the Trustee or the
Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to
include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and
doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof
or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating
Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such
Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then
for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time
an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an
Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time
terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof
to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a

65
<PAGE>

notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating
Agent that shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of
such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of
Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will
serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.
No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the
provisions of this Section.

The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to
time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.

If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant
to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon an
alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

ARTICLE TEN

COVENANTS

Section 1001. Payment of Principal Premium and Interest.

The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of
Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium
and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of
the Securities and this Indenture. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated
by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest due on
Bearer Securities on or before Maturity shall be payable only upon presentation
and surrender of the several coupons for such interest installments as are
evidenced thereby as they severally mature. At the Company's option, payments
of principal or interest may be made by check or by transfer to an account
maintained by the payee subject, in the case of Bearer Securities, to the
provisions of Section 1002.

Section 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of
Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented
or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered
for registration of transfer, exchange or conversion and where notices and
demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and
this Indenture may be served. If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer
Securities, the Company will maintain, subject to any laws and regulations
applicable thereto, an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series
which is located outside the United States where Securities of such series and
the related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment; provided,
however, that if the Securities of such series are

74
<PAGE>

listed on The International (London) Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange
located outside the United States and said stock exchange shall so require, the
Company may maintain a Paying Agent in London or any other required city located
outside the United States, as the case may be, so long as the Securities of such
series are listed on such exchange. The Company will give prompt written notice
to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of any such
office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such
required office or agency in respect of any series of Securities or shall fail
to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations and
surrenders of Securities of that series may be made and notices and demands may
be made or served at the address of the Trustee, except that Bearer Securities
of that series and the related coupons may be presented and surrendered for
payment at the place specified for that purpose as contemplated by Section 301
or, if no such place is specified, at the main office of the Trustee in London
and the Company hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such respective
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

No payment of principal or interest on Bearer Securities shall be made
at any office or agency of the Company in the United States, by check mailed to
any address in the United States, by transfer to an account located in the
United States or upon presentation or surrender in the United States of a Bearer
Security or coupon for payment, even if the payment would be credited to an
account located outside of the United States; provided, however, that if the
Securities of a series are denominated and payable in Dollars, payment of
principal of and any interest on any such Bearer Security shall be made at the
Office of the Company's paying agent in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of
New York, if (but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such
principal, interest or additional amounts, as the case may be, at all offices or
agencies outside the United States maintains for such purpose by the Company in
accordance with its Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange
controls or other similar restrictions. The Company will give prompt written
notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such
office or agency.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other
offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented
or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind
such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission
shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office
or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such
purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any
such designation or

75
<PAGE>

rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

Section 1003. Money for Securities Payments to
Be Held in Trust.

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with
respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series,
segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a
sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to
act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any
series of Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, it will, prior to
each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities
of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount,
such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such
Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its
action or failure so to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities
other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in
which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions
of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of
the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the
continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the
Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the
Securities of that series, and upon the written request of the Trustee,
forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for
payment in respect of the Securities of that series.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee,
such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to
such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held
by the Company, in trust for the payment of

76
<PAGE>

the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and
remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has
become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if
then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of
such Security or coupon shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look
only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or
such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the
Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment,
may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper
published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day
and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York,
New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date
specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such
publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid
to the Company.

Section 1004. Statement by Officers as to Default.

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end
of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers'
Certificate, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof
the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms,
provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of
grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company shall be
in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of
which they may have knowledge.

Section 1005. Existence.

Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the
Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss
thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 1006. Maintenance of Properties.

77
<PAGE>

The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of
its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good
condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment
and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements,
betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may
be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be
properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the
operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in
the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business or the
business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to
the Holders.

Section 1007. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged,
before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or
upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2)
all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by
law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to
be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount,
applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings.

Section 1008. Restrictions on Sale or Pledge of
Stock of Home Savings.

The Company (a) shall not (i) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any shares of Voting Stock of Home Savings or (ii) permit Home Savings to issue,
sell or otherwise dispose of shares of its Voting Stock unless in either case
Home Savings remains a Controlled Subsidiary, and (b) shall not permit Home
Savings to (i) merge or consolidate unless the surviving entity is the Company
or a Controlled Subsidiary or (ii) convey or transfer its properties and assets
substantially as an entirety to any Person, except to the Company or a
Controlled Subsidiary. "Controlled Subsidiary" means any Person at least 80% of
the outstanding shares of Voting Stock (except for directors' qualifying shares)
of which is at the time owned directly or indirectly by the Company.

The Company shall not create, assume, incur or suffer to exist, as
security for indebtedness for borrowed money, any

78
<PAGE>

mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, lien or charge of any kind upon the Voting Stock
of Home Savings (other than directors' qualifying shares) without effectively
providing that the Securities shall be secured equally and ratably with (or
prior to) such indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company may create,
assume, incur or suffer to exist any such mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, lien or
charge without regard to the foregoing provisions so long as after giving effect
thereto the Company will own directly or indirectly at least 80% of the Voting
Stock of Home Savings then issued and outstanding, free and clear of any such
mortgage, pledge, encumbrance, lien or charge. For the purposes of this Section
1008, the term "Voting Stock" of any Person shall mean stock of any class or
classes, however designated, having ordinary voting power for the election of a
majority of the board of directors of such Person, other than stock having such
power only by reason of the happening of a contingency.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may avoid the restrictions
described in the previous two paragraphs if prior to any such transaction Home
Savings shall have unconditionally guaranteed payment when due of the principal
or premium, if any, and interest on the Securities, Home Savings shall have
obtained all regulatory approvals, if any, required to permit the guarantee of
the Securities, and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel stating that the guarantee of the Securities by Home Savings has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered and constitutes a valid, legally binding
and enforceable obligation of Home Savings.

Section 1009. Waiver of Certain Covenants.

The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any
term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 1001 to 1003 and 1005 to
1008, inclusive, with respect to the Securities of any series if before the time
for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either
waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such
term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such
term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and,
until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the
duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall
remain in full force and effect.

REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES

Section 1101. Applicability of Article.

Securities of any series that are redeemable before their Stated
Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series)
in accordance with this Article.

Section 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be
evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of
the Company of less than all the Securities of any series, the Company shall, at
least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a
shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such
Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be
redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In
the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any
restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or
elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an
Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.

Section 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities
to Be Redeemed.

If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed
(unless all of the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be
redeemed), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more
than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding
Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method
as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and that may provide for the
selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized
denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of
the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than
the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series. If less than
all of the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be
redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more
than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding
Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for

80
<PAGE>

redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. If any Security selected
for partial redemption is converted in part before the termination of the
conversion right resulting from such selection, the converted portion of such
security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for
redemption. Securities that have been converted during a selection of
Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the
purposes of such selection.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the
Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected
for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate,
in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the
portion of the principal amount of such Securities that has been or is to be
redeemed.

Section 1104. Notice of Redemption.

Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption
Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his or her address
appearing in the Security Register.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price,

(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to
be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of
any Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be
redeemed,

(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due
and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that
interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,

(5) if the Security is convertible, the conversion price, the date on
which the right to convert the principal of the Securities to be redeemed
will terminate and the place or places where such Securities may be
surrendered for conversion,

81
<PAGE>

(6) the place or places where such Securities, together in the case of
Bearer Securities with all coupons appertaining thereto, if any, maturing
after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the
Redemption Price,

(7) that the redemption is from a sinking fund, if such is the case,
and

(8) the CUSIP numbers of the Securities to be redeemed.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of
the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable.

Section 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.

Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of
money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption
Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities
that are to be redeemed on that date. If any Security called for redemption is
converted pursuant to Article Thirteen, any money deposited with the Trustee or
so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security shall be
paid to the Company on Company Request, or if then held by the Company, shall be
discharged from such trust.

Section 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so
to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the
Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued
interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest and the coupons for such
interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except as
otherwise provided herein, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security
for redemption in accordance with said notice, together will all coupons, if
any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date such Security shall
be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest on
Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date
shall be payable

82
<PAGE>

only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as
otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of coupons for
such interest; and provided, further, that, unless otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is
on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 307.

If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be
accompanied by all pertinent coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such
Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal
to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing
coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there may be
furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of
them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security
shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in
respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price,
such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided,
however, that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office
or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in
Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301,
only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until
paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in
the Security.

Section 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.

Any Registered Security that is to be redeemed only in part shall be
surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee
so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof
or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such
Security without service charge, a new Registered Security or Securities of the
same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by
such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the
unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the
terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking

such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking
fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made
pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such
series; provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited.
Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee
at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through
operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall
be reduced accordingly.

crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 1202 and will also
deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days
before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the
Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner

repurchase date, unless the Company defaults in making the payment due upon
redemption or repurchase.

The price at which shares of Common Stock shall be delivered upon
conversion (herein called the "conversion price") shall be the price specified
in relation to Securities of such series pursuant to Section 301. The
conversion price shall be

85
<PAGE>

reduced in certain instances as provided in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5),
(6), (7) and (9) of Section 1304 and shall be increased in certain instances as
provided in paragraph (3) of Section 1304.

In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, declare or make a
distribution on its Common Stock referred to in paragraph (4) or (5) of Section
1304, the Holder of each Security, upon the conversion thereof pursuant to this
Article subsequent to the close of business on the date fixed for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution and prior to
the effectiveness of the conversion price adjustment in respect of such
distribution pursuant to paragraph (4) or (5) of Section 1304, shall also be
entitled to receive for each share of Common Stock into which such Security is
converted, the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital
stock, cash and assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock,
provided that, at the election of the Company (whose election shall be evidenced
by a Board Resolution) with respect to all Holders so converting, the Company
may, in lieu of distributing to such Holder any portion of such distribution not
consisting of cash or securities of the Company, pay such Holder an amount in
cash equal to the fair market value thereof (as determined by the Board of
Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board
Resolution). If any conversion of a Security described in the immediately
preceding sentence occurs prior to the payment date for a distribution to
holders of Common Stock that the Holder of the Security so converted is entitled
to receive in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Company
may elect (such election to be evidenced by a Board Resolution) to distribute to
such Holder a due bill for the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital
stock, cash or assets to which such Holder is so entitled, provided that such
due bill (i) meets any applicable requirements of the principal national
securities exchange or other market on which the Common Stock is then traded and
(ii) requires payment or delivery of such evidences of indebtedness, shares of
capital stock, cash or assets no later than the date of payment or delivery
thereof to holders of Common Stock receiving such distribution.

Section 1302. Exercise of Conversion Privilege.

In order to exercise the conversion privilege, the Holder of any
Security to be converted shall surrender such Security, duly endorsed or
assigned to the Company or in blank in the case of Registered Securities,
together in the case of Bearer Securities with all unmatured coupons and any
unmatured coupons in default appertaining thereto at any office or agency of the
Company maintained for that purpose pursuant to Section 1002,

86
<PAGE>

accompanied by written notice to the Company at such office or agency that the
Holder elects to convert such Security or, if less than the entire principal
amount thereof is to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted.
Registered Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the
close of business on any Regular Record Date next preceding any Interest payment
Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date shall (except in
the case of Registered Securities or portions thereof that have been called for
redemption, or are to be repurchased, on such Interest Payment Date or on a
Redemption Date or a repurchase date within the period beginning on such Regular
Record Date and ending on such Interest Payment Date) be accompanied by payment
by wire transfer or certified check or other funds acceptable to the Company of
an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the
principal amount of Securities being surrendered for conversion (or, if such
Registered Security was issued in exchange for a Bearer Security after the close
on such Regular Record Date, by surrender of one or more coupons relating to
such Interest Payment Date or by both payment in such funds and surrender of
such coupon or coupons, in either case, in an amount equal to the interest
payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of the Registered
Security then being converted). Except as provided in the preceding sentence
and subject to the fourth paragraph of Section 307, no payment or adjustment
shall be made upon any conversion on account of any interest accrued on the
Securities surrendered for conversion or on account of any dividends on the
Common Stock issued upon conversion.

Securities shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to
the close of business on the day of surrender of such Securities for conversion
in accordance with the foregoing provisions, and at such time the rights of the
Holders of such Securities as Holders shall cease, and the person or persons
entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock at such
time. As promptly as practicable on or after the conversion date, the Company
shall issue and shall deliver at such office or agency a certificate or
certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as
provided in Section 1303.

In the case of any Security that is converted in part only, upon such
conversion the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or
Securities of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to
the unconverted portion of the principal amount of such Security, along with the
coupons appertaining thereto.

87
<PAGE>

Section 1303. Fractions of Shares.

No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion
of Securities. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at
one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares that shall be issuable
upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
principal amount of the Securities (or, in the case of Registered Securities,
specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of
Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any Security or
securities (or, in the case of Registered Securities, specified portions
thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in
an amount equal to the same fraction of the Closing Price at the close of
business on the date of conversion.

Section 1304. Adjustment of Conversion Price.

(1) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other
distribution on its Common Stock exclusively in Common Stock or shall pay or
make a dividend or other distribution on any other class of capital stock of the
Company which dividend or distribution includes Common Stock, the conversion
price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day fixed
for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other
distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such conversion price by a fraction
of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the
denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of
shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to
become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following
the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (1),
the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include
shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in
respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common
Stock. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on
shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.

(2) Subject to the last sentence of paragraph (7) of this Section, in
case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on its
Common Stock consisting exclusively of, or shall otherwise issue to all holders
of its Common Stock, rights or warrants entitling the holders thereof to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than
the current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of
this Section) of the Common Stock on the date

88
<PAGE>

fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or
warrants, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on the day
following the date fixed for such determination shall be reduced by multiplying
such conversion price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed
for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so
offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such current market price
and the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at
the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number
of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such
reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the
day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this
paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding
shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include
shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of
shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not issue any rights or warrants in
respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.

(3) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided
into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the conversion price in effect
at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such
subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely,
in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller
number of shares of Common Stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening
of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes
effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the
case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on
the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes
effective.

(4) Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph (4), in case the
Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common
Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of any class of capital stock, cash
or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred
to in paragraph (2) of this Section, excluding any dividend or distribution paid
exclusively in cash and excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in
paragraph (1) of this Section), the conversion price shall be reduced so that
the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in
effect immediately prior to the effectiveness of the conversion price reduction
contemplated by this paragraph (4) by a fraction of which the numerator shall be
the current

89
<PAGE>

market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section)
of the Common Stock on the date of such effectiveness less the fair market value
(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination
shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), on the date of such
effectiveness, of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of
capital stock, cash and assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common
Stock and the denominator shall be such current market price per share of the
Common Stock, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the
opening of business on the day following the later of (a) the date fixed for the
payment of such distribution and (b) the date 20 days after the notice relating
to such distribution is given pursuant to Section 1306(a) (such later date of
(a) and (b) being referred to as the "Reference Date"). If the Board of
Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of
this paragraph (4) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for
any securities comprising such distribution, it must in doing so consider the
prices in such market over the same period used in computing the current market
price per share pursuant to paragraph (8) of this Section. For purposes of this
paragraph (4), any dividend or distribution that includes shares of Common
Stock, rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock
shall be deemed instead to be (a) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of
indebtedness, cash, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of
Common Stock, such rights or warrants or such other convertible or exchangeable
securities (making any conversion price reduction required by this paragraph
(4)), immediately followed by (b) in the case of such shares of Common Stock or
such rights or warrants, a dividend or distribution thereof (making any further
conversion price reduction required by paragraph (1) or (2) of this Section,
except (i) the Reference Date of such dividend or distribution as defined in
this paragraph (4) shall be substituted for "the date fixed for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and "the
date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraphs (1) and (2)
of this Section and (ii) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or
distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the
date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (1) of this
Section) or (c) in the case of such other convertible or exchangeable
securities, a dividend or distribution of such number of shares of Common Stock
as would then be issuable upon the conversion or exchange thereof, whether or
not the conversion or exchange of such securities is subject to any conditions
(making any further conversion price reduction required by paragraph (1) of this
Section, except (i) the Reference Date of such dividend or distribution as
defined in this paragraph (4) shall be substituted as "the date fixed for

90
<PAGE>

the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and
"the date fixed for such determination" and (ii) the shares deemed to constitute
such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of
business on the date fixed for such determination", each within the meaning of
paragraph (1) of this Section).

(5) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, at any time
distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is
distributed as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this
Section) in an aggregate amount that, together with (i) the aggregate amount of
any other distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in
cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and
in respect of which no conversion price adjustment pursuant to this paragraph
(5) has been made and (ii) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value
(as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be
conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of consideration payable in
respect of any tender offer by the Company or a Subsidiary for all or any
portion of the Company's Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding
the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no conversion
price adjustment pursuant to paragraph (6) of this Section has been made,
exceeds 10% of the product of the current market price per share (determined as
provided in paragraph (8) of this Section) of the Common Stock on the date fixed
for stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, times the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, the conversion price shall be
reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the
conversion price in effect immediately prior to the effectiveness of the
conversion price reduction contemplated by this paragraph (5) by a fraction of
which the numerator shall be the current market price per share (determined as
provided in paragraph (8) of this Section) of the Common Stock on the date of
such effectiveness less the amount of cash so distributed applicable to one
share of Common Stock and the denominator shall be such current market price per
share of the Common Stock, such reduction to become effective immediately prior
to the opening of business on the later of (a) the day following the date fixed
for the payment of such distribution and (b) the date 20 days after the notice
relating to such distribution is given pursuant to Section 1306(a).

(6) In case a tender offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary for
all or any portion of the Company's Common Stock shall expire and such tender
offer shall involve an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as
determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive
and described in a Board Resolution) on the last time (the

91
<PAGE>

"Expiration Time") tenders may be made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may
be amended) that, together with (i) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair
market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall
be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such
tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any tender offer by the
Company, or a Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Company's Common Stock
expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and
in respect of which no conversion price adjustment pursuant to this paragraph
(6) has been made and (ii) the aggregate amount of any distributions to all
holders of the Company's Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12
months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no
conversion price adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section has been
made, exceeds 5% of the product of the current market price per share determined
as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section) of the Common Stock on the
Expiration Time times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
(including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time, the conversion price
shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by
multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the Expiration
Time by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (i) the product of the
current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this
Section) of the Common Stock on the Expiration Time times the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration
Time key minus (ii) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the
aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to
any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so
accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares")
and the denominator shall be the product of (i) such current market price per
share on the Expiration Time times (ii) such number of outstanding shares on the
Expiration Time less the number of Purchased Shares, such reduction to become
effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the
Expiration Time. No such adjustment shall be made in the event of any purchase
pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.

(7) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including
securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a
consolidation or merger to which Section 1310 applies) shall be deemed to
involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all
holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall
be deemed to be "the Reference Date" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this
Section), and (b) a subdivision or combination, as the Case may be, of the
number of

92
<PAGE>

shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification
into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter
(and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day
upon which such subdivision becomes effective", or "the day upon which such
combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such
subdivision or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph
(3) of this Section). Rights or warrants issued by the Company to all holders
of its Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock, which rights or warrants (i) are deemed to be
transferred with such shares of Common Stock, (ii) are exercisable and (iii) are
also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, in each case in
clauses (i) through (iii) until the occurrence of a specified event or events
("Trigger Event"), shall for purposes of this Section 1304 not be deemed issued
and the distribution thereof not be deemed made or paid until the occurrence of
the earliest Trigger Event.

(8) For the purpose of any computation under this paragraph and
paragraphs (2), (4) and (5) of this Section, the current market price per share
of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the Closing
Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days selected by the Company commencing
not more than 20 Trading Days before, and ending not later than, the date in
question; provided, however, that (i) if the "ex" date for any event (other than
the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an
adjustment to the conversion price occurs on or after the 20th Trading Day prior
to the day in question and prior to the "ex" date for the issuance or
distribution requiring such computation, the Closing Price for each Trading Day
prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying
such Closing Price by the same fraction by which the conversion price is so
required to be adjusted as a result of such other event, (ii) if the "ex" date
for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such
computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price occurs on or
after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation
and on or prior to the day in question, the Closing Price for each Trading Day
on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying
such Closing Price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the conversion
price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event and (iii) if
the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is on
or prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment
required pursuant to clause (ii) of this proviso, the Closing Price for each
Trading Day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the
amount of any cash and the fair market value on the day in question (as
determined by the Board of Directors in a manner consistent with any

93
<PAGE>

determination of such value for purposes of paragraph (4) or (5) of this
Section, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board
Resolution) of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock or assets
being distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock as of the close of
business on the day before such "ex" date. For the purpose of any computation
under Paragraph (6) of this Section, the current market price per share of
Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily Closing
Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days selected by the Company commencing
on or after the latest (the "Commencement Date") of (i) the date 20 Trading Days
before the date in question, (ii) the date of commencement of the tender offer
requiring such computation and (iii) the date of the last amendment, if any, of
such tender offer involving a change in the maximum number of shares for which
tenders are sought or a change in the consideration offered, and ending not
later than the Expiration Time of such tender offer; provided, however, that if
the "ex" date for any such event (other than the tender offer requiring such
computation) that requires an adjustment to the conversion price occurs on or
after the Commencement Date and prior to the Expiration Time for the tender
offer requiring such computation, the Closing Price for each Trading Day prior
to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such
Closing Price by the same fraction by which the conversion price is so required
to be adjusted as a result of such other event. For purposes of this paragraph
the term "'ex' date", (i) when used with respect to any issuance or
distribution, means the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way
on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the Closing price
was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (ii)
when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of Common
Stock, means the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such
exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or
combination becomes effective and (iii) when used with respect to any tender
offer means the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such
exchange or in such market after the Expiration Time of such tender offer.

(9) The Company may make such reductions in the conversion price, in
addition to those required by this Section, as it considers to be advisable in
order that any event treated for Federal income tax purposes as a dividend of
stock or stock rights shall not be taxable to the recipients.

(10) No adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless
such adjustment would required an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the
conversion price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of
this paragraph

94
<PAGE>

(10) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account
in any subsequent adjustment.

(11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 1304, no
adjustment to the conversion price shall reduce the conversion price below the
then par value per share of the Common Stock, and any such purported adjustment
shall instead reduce the conversion price to such par value. The Company hereby
covenants not to take any action that would or does result in any adjustment in
the conversion price that, if made without giving effect to the previous
sentence, would cause the conversion price to be less than the then par value
per share of the Common Stock.

Section 1305. Notice of Adjustments of Conversion Price.

Whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided and at
such other times as the Trustee shall request:

(a) the Company shall compute the adjusted conversion price
in accordance with Section 1304 and shall prepare a certificate signed

price and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such
adjustment is based, and such certificate shall forthwith be delivered
to the Trustee and filed at each office or agency maintained for the
purpose of conversion of Securities pursuant to Section 1002; and

(b) a notice stating that the conversion price has been
adjusted and setting forth the adjusted conversion price shall
forthwith be required, and, when the conversion price is adjusted, as
soon as practicable after it is required, the Company shall cause such
notice to be mailed to all Holders of Registered Securities at their
last addresses as they shall appear in the Security Register.

In case:

(a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other
distribution) on its Common Stock payable otherwise than in cash out
of its retained earnings; or

substantially all of the assets of the Company; or

(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the Company; or

(e) the Company or any Subsidiary shall commence a tender
offer for all or a portion of the Company's outstanding shares of
Common Stock (or shall amend any such tender offer);

then the Company shall notify the Trustee and cause to be filed at each office
or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of securities pursuant to
Section 1002, and shall cause to be mailed to all Holders of Registered
Securities at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security
Register, at least 20 days (or 10 days in any case specified in clause (a) or
(b) above) prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, a notice
stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution, rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken,
the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to
such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the
date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the

transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or (z) the date on which such
tender offer commenced, the date on which such tender offer is scheduled to
expire unless extended, the consideration offered and the other material terms
thereof (or the material terms of any amendment thereto).

Section 1307. Company to Reserve Common Stock.

The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from
preemptive rights, out of its authorized but

96
<PAGE>

unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of
Securities, the full number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the
conversion of all outstanding Securities.

Section 1308. Taxes on Conversions.

The Company will pay any and all taxes, other than any franchise or
income taxes, that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares
of Common stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall
not, however, be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name
other than that of the Holder of the Security or Securities to be converted, and
no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting
such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax, or has
established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

Section 1309. Covenant as to Common Stock.

The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that may be
issued upon conversion of Securities will upon issue be fully paid and
nonassessable and, except as provided in Section 1308, the Company will pay all
taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

Section 1310. Cancellation of Converted Securities.

All Securities delivered for conversion shall be delivered to the
Trustee to be cancelled by or at the direction of the Trustee, which shall
dispose of the same as provided in Section 309.

Section 1311. Provisions in the Case of Consolidation,
Merger or Sales of Assets.

In case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the
Company into, any other corporation, or in case of any merger of another
corporation into the Company (other than a merger which does not result in any
reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of
Common Stock of the Company), or in case of any sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, the corporation formed by such
consolidation or resulting from such merger or which acquires such assets, as
the case may be, shall execute and

97
<PAGE>

deliver to the trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the Holder of
each Security then outstanding shall have the right thereafter, during the
period such Security shall be convertible as specified in Section 1301, to
convert such Security only into the kind and amount of securities, cash and
other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by a
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into which such
Security might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation,
merger, sale or transfer, assuming such holder of Common Stock of the Company
failed to exercise his or her rights of election, if any, as to the kind or
amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such
consolidation, merger, sale or transfer (provided that if the kind or amount of
securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger,
sale or transfer is not the same for each share of Common Stock of the company
in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("non-
electing share"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of
securities, cash and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger,
sale or transfer by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and
amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares).

Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which, for
events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental indenture, shall be
as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in
this Article. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to
successive consolidations, mergers, sales or transfers.

Section 1404 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose,
such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of
such series and any related coupons and to have satisfied all its other
obligations under the Securities of such series, and this Indenture insofar as
the Securities of such series are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of
the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject
to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged
hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive,
solely from the trust fund described in Section 1404 and as more fully set forth
in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and
interest on such Securities of such series when payments are due, (2) the
Company's obligations with respect to the Securities of such series under
Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties
and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article Fourteen. Subject
to compliance with this Article Fourteen, the Company may exercise its option
provided in Section 1401 to have this Section 1402 applied to the Outstanding
Securities of any Defeasible Series notwithstanding the prior exercise of its
option provided in Section 1401 to have Section 1403 applied to the Outstanding
Securities of such series.

Section 1403. Covenant Defeasance.

Upon the Company's exercise of the option provided in Section 1401 to
have this Section 1403 applied to the Outstanding Securities of any Defeasible
Series, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections
1005 through 1008, inclusive, (2) the occurrence of any event specified in
Sections 501(4) (with respect to any of Sections 1005 through 1008, inclusive),
501(5) and 501(8) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default and
(3) the provisions of Article Fifteen shall cease to be effective, in each case
with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series as provided in this
Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1404 are
satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such
Covenant Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and shall
have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in
any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section
501(4)) or Article Fifteen, whether directly or indirectly by

99
<PAGE>

reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or Article or by
reason of any reference in any such Section or Article to any other provision
herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and the
Securities of such series shall be unaffected thereby.

Section 1404. Conditions to Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance.

The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section
1402 or Section 1403 to the Outstanding Securities of any Defeasible Series:

(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee that satisfies the
requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees to comply with the
provisions of this Article Fourteen applicable to it) as trust funds in
trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically
pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the
Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series, (A) money in an amount,
or (B) U.S. Government Obligations that through the scheduled payment of
principal and interest in respect thereof (without consideration of any
reinvestment thereof) in accordance with their terms will provide, not
later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount,
or (C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and
discharge, and that shall be applied by the Trustee (or any such other
qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and any premium
and interest on the Securities of such series on the respective Stated
Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the
Securities of such series. As used herein, "U.S. Government Obligation"
means (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the United States
of America for the payment of which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled
or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United
States of America the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a
full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in
either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the
issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined
in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) as custodian
with respect to any U.S. Government Obligation specified in Clause (x) and
held by such custodian for the

100
<PAGE>

account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any
specific payment of principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government
Obligation; provided, however, that (except as required by law) such
custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable
to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the
custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific
payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt.

(2) In the case of an election under Section 1402, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the
Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date first set forth hereinabove,
there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either
case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will
not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of
the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to the
Securities of such series and will be subject to Federal income tax on the
same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case
if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur.

(3) In the case of an election under Section 1403, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the
Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not recognize
gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and
Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to the Securities of such
series and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the
same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and
Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.

(4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate to the effect that the Securities of such series, if then
listed on any securities exchange, will not be delisted as a result of such
deposit.

(5) No Event of Default or event that (after notice or lapse of time
or both) would become an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any Event of
Default or any such event specified in Sections 501(6) and (7), at any time
on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being
understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after
such 90th day).

101
<PAGE>

(6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee
to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture
Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such
Act).

(7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement
or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.

(8) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been
complied with.

(9) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the
trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless such
trust shall be qualified under such Act or exempt from regulation
thereunder.

(10) At the time of such deposit, (A) no default in the payment of any
principal of or premium or interest on any Senior Indebtedness shall have
occurred and be continuing, (B) no event of default with respect to any
Senior Indebtedness shall have resulted in such Senior Indebtedness
becoming, and continuing to be, due and payable prior to the date on which
it would otherwise have become due and payable (unless payment of such
Senior Indebtedness has been made or duly provided for), and (C) no other
event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have
occurred and be continuing permitting (after notice or lapse of time or
both) the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of
such holders) to declare such Senior Indebtedness due and payable prior to
the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable.

Section 1405. Deposited Money and U.S. Government
Obligations to be Held in Trust; Other
Miscellaneous Provisions.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003,
all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof)
deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes
of this Section and Section 1406, the Trustee and any such other trustee
are referred to collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1404 in
respect of the Securities of any Defeasible Series shall be held in trust
and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the

102
<PAGE>

provisions of the Securities of such series and this Indenture, to the
payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the
Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to
the Holders of Securities of such series, of all sums due and to become due
thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so
held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent
required by law. Money and U.S. Government Obligations so held in trust
shall not be subject to the provisions of Article Fifteen.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax,
fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government
Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1404 or the principal and
interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other
charge that by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding
Securities.

Anything in this Article Fourteen to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time
to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held
by it as provided in Section 1404 with respect to Securities of any
Defeasible Series that, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof
delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof that would
then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Securities of such series.

The provisions for subordination of the Securities set forth in
Article Fifteen are hereby expressly made subject to the provisions for
defeasance or covenant defeasance in this Article Fourteen and, anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the effectiveness of such
defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to the Outstanding
Securities, such Securities shall thereupon cease to be so subordinated.

Section 1406. Reinstatement.

If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money
in accordance with this Article Fourteen with respect to the Securities of
any series by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental
authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application,
then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of
such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had
occurred pursuant to this Article Fourteen with respect to Securities of
such series until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to
apply all money held in trust

103
<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 1405 with respect to Securities of such series in
accordance with this Article Fourteen; provided, however, that if the
Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any
Security of such series following the reinstatement of its obligations, the
Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of Securities of
such series to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.

ARTICLE FIFTEEN

SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES

Section 1501. Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness.

The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security,
by his or her acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to
the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article, the
indebtedness represented by the Securities and the payment of the principal
of and interest on each and all of the Securities are hereby expressly made
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of
all Senior Indebtedness. The provisions of this Article Fifteen are
subject to the final paragraph of Section 1405.

Section 1502. Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc.

In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or
proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other
similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to the Company
or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets, or (b) any liquidation,
dissolution or other winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c)
any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of
assets and liabilities of the Company, then and in any such event the
holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full
of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior
Indebtedness before the Holders of the Securities and any coupons
appurtenant thereto are entitled to receive any payment on account of
principal of or interest on the Securities, and to that end the holders of
Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for application to the
payment thereof, any payment or distribution of any kind or character,
whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or
distribution that may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of
any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of
the Securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the
Securities in any such

104
<PAGE>

case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up or event.

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section, the Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received
any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such
payment or distribution that may be payable or deliverable by reason of the
payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the
payment of the Securities, before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full,
and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or
distribution, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be,
such Holder, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be
paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver,
liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making
payment or distribution of assets of the Company for application to the
payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent
necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, after giving effect to
any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the Holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

For purposes of this Article only, the words "cash, property or
securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company
as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other
corporation provided for by a plan or reorganization or readjustment that
are subordinated in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness that may at
the time be outstanding to substantially the same extent as, or to a
greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this
Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the
Company following the conveyance or transfer of its properties and assets
substantially as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and
conditions set forth in Article Eight shall not be deemed a dissolution,
winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the
purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into
which the Company is merged or the Person that acquires by conveyance or
transfer such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the
case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or
transfer, comply with the conditions set forth in Article Eight.

105
<PAGE>

Section 1503. Prior Payment to Senior Indebtedness Upon
Acceleration of Securities.

In the event that any Securities are declared due and payable
before their Stated Maturity, then and in such event the holders of the
Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all
amounts due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness before the Holders
of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment (including any
payment that may be payable by reason of the payment of any other
indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the
Securities) by the Company on account of the principal of or interest on
the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of
Securities or Securities which have been converted pursuant to Article 13.

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security
prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact
shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the
Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such
payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company.

The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment
with respect to which Section 1502 would be applicable.

Section 1504. No Payment When Senior Indebtedness
in Default.

(a) In the event and during the continuation of any default in
the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior
Indebtedness beyond any applicable grace period with respect thereto, or in
the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness
shall have occurred and be continuing permitting the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to declare
such Senior Indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it
would otherwise have become due and payable, and unless and until such
event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to
exist, or (b) in the event any judicial proceeding shall be pending with
respect to any such default in payment or event of default, then no payment
(including any payment that may be payable by reason of the payment of any
other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the
Securities) shall be made by the Company on account of principal of or
interest on the Securities and any coupon appurtenant thereto or on account
of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities.

106
<PAGE>

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security or
coupon prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such
fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known
to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event
such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company.

The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment
with respect to which Section 1502 would be applicable.

Section 1505. Payment Permitted if No Default.

Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture
or in any of the Securities shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time
except during the pendency of any case, proceeding, dissolution,
liquidation or other winding up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or
other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to in
Section 1502 or under the conditions described in Section 1503 or 1504,
from making payments at any time of principal of or interest on the
Securities, or (b) the application by the Trustee of any money deposited
with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of or
interest on the Securities or the retention of such payment by the Holders,
if, at the time of such application by the Trustee, it did not have
knowledge as provided in Section 1510 that such payment would have been
prohibited by the provisions of this Article.

Section 1506. Subrogation to Rights of Holders of
Senior Indebtedness.

Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the
Holders of the Securities and any coupons appurtenant thereto shall be
subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the
Company that by its express terms is subordinated to indebtedness of the
Company to substantially the same extent as the Securities are subordinated
and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders
of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash,
property and securities applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the
principal of and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full. For
purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders
of the Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the
Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the
provisions of this Article, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions
of this Article to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the
Securities or the Trustee,

107
<PAGE>

shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior
Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment
or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness.

Section 1507. Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights.

The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for
the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the
Securities on the one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness on the
other hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this
Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among
the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and
the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional (and which, subject to the rights under this
Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, is intended to the fullest
extent permitted by law to rank equally with all other general obligations
of the Company), to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of
and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and
payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect the relative rights
against the Company of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the
Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness; or (c) prevent the
Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies
otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture,
subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable or
deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder.

Section 1508. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.

Each holder of a Security by his or her acceptance thereof
authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such action
as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided
in this Article and appoints the Trustee his or her attorney-in-fact for
any and all such purposes.

Section 1509. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.

No right of any present or future holder of any Senior
Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time
in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the
part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any
such holder, or by any non-compliance by the Company with the terms,
provisions and

108
<PAGE>

covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such
holder may have or be otherwise charged with.

Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing
paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from
time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the
Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders
of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination
provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the
Securities to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the
following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the
time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise
amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness or any instrument
evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is
outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any
property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness;
(iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior
Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against the Company and any other Person.

Section 1510. Notice to Trustee.

The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of
any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment
to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Article or any other provision of this Indenture, the
Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts
that would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in
respect of the Securities, unless and until the Trustee shall have received
written notice thereof from the Company or a holder of Senior Indebtedness
or from any trustee therefor, and, prior to the receipt of any such written
notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, shall be
entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided,
however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided
for in this Section 1510 at least three Business Days prior to the date
upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose
(including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of or interest
on any Security), then, anything herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive
such money and to apply the same to the purpose for which such money was
received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may
be received by it during or after such three Business Day period.

109
<PAGE>

Subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall be
entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person
representing himself or herself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a
trustee therefor) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder
of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee therefor). In the event that the
Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with
respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to
participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article, the
Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by
such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in
such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of
such Person under this Article, and if such evidence is not furnished, the
Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination
as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

Section 1511. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate
of Liquidating Agent.

Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company
referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of
Section 601, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to rely
upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in
which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is
pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver,
liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the
Trustee or to the Holders of Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining
the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the
holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company,
the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or
distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this
Article.

Section 1512. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders
of Senior Indebtedness.

The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not liable to any such holders if
it shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of
Securities or coupons or to the Company or to any other Person cash,
property or securities to

110
<PAGE>

which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of
this Article or otherwise.

Section 1513. Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior
Indebtedness; Preservation of Trustee's Rights.

The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all
the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior
Indebtedness that may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any
other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall
deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.

Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to,
the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607.

Section 1514. Article Applicable to Payment Agents.

In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall
have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term
"Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context
otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying
Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such
Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the
Trustee; provided, however, that Section 1513 shall not apply to the
Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as
Paying Agent.

of Los Angeles, the Borough of Manhattan or The City of New York for such
meeting and may call such meeting for such purposes by giving notice
thereof as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.

Section 1603. Persons Entitled to Vote at Meetings.

To be entitled to vote at any meeting of Holders of Securities of
any series, a Person shall be (1) a Holder of one or more Outstanding
Securities of such series, or (2) a Person appointed by an instrument in
writing as proxy for a Holder or Holders of one or more Outstanding
Securities of such series by such Holder or Holders. The only Persons who
shall be entitled to be present or to speak at any meeting of Holders of
Securities of any series shall be the Persons entitled to vote at such
meeting and their counsel, any representatives of the Trustee and its
counsel and any representatives of the Company and its counsel.

Section 1604. Quorum; Action.

The Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of a series shall constitute a quorum for a
meeting of Holders of Securities of such series. In the absence of a
quorum within 30 minutes of the time appointed for any such meeting, the
meeting shall, if convened at the request of Holders of Securities of such
series, be

112
<PAGE>

dissolved. In the absence of a quorum in any other case the meeting may be
adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days as determined by the
chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such adjourned meeting.
Notice of the reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as
provided in Section 1602(a), except that such notice need be given only
once not less than five days prior to the date on which the meeting is
scheduled to be reconvened. Notice of the reconvening of an adjourned
meeting shall state expressly the percentage, as provided above, of the
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series which shall
constitute a quorum.

Except as limited by the provisos to Section 902, any resolution
presented to a meeting or adjourned meeting duly reconvened at which a
quorum is present as aforesaid may be adopted only by the affirmative vote
of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of that series; provided, however, that, except as limited by
the provisos to Section 902, any resolution with respect to any request,
demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act
which this Indenture expressly provides may be made, given or taken by the
Holders of a specified percentage, which is less than a majority, in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of a series may be adopted
at a meeting or an adjourned meeting duly reconvened and at which a quorum
is present as aforesaid by the affirmative vote or the Holders of such
specified percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
that series.

Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of Holders
of Securities of any series duly held in accordance with this Section shall
be binding on all the Holders of Securities of such series and the related
coupons, whether or not present or represented at the meeting.

Section 1605. Determination of Voting Rights;
Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the
Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for
any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series in regard to proof of
the holding of Securities of such series and of the appointment of proxies
and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the
submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of
the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the
meeting as it shall deem appropriate. Except as otherwise permitted or
required by any such regulations, the holding of Securities shall be proved
in the manner specified in Section 104 and the appointment of any proxy
shall be proved in the manner

113
<PAGE>

specified in Section 104 or, in the case of Bearer Securities, by having
the signature of the person executing the proxy witnessed or guaranteed by
any trust company, bank or banker authorized by Section 104 to certify to
the holding of Bearer Securities. Such regulations may provide that
written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be
presumed valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 104 or
other proof.

(b) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a
temporary chairperson of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been
called by the Company or by Holders of Securities as provided in Section
1602(b), in which case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the
series calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner
appoint a temporary chairperson. A permanent chairperson and a permanent
secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled
to vote a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
such series represented at the meeting.

(c) At any meeting each Holder of a Security of such series or
proxy shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount (or
the equivalent in ECU, any other composite currency or a Foreign Currency)
of Securities of such series held or represented by him; provided, however,
that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any
Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairperson of the
meeting not to be Outstanding. The chairperson of the meeting shall have
no right to vote, except as a Holder of a Security of such series or proxy.

(d) Any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series duly
called pursuant to Section 1602 at which a quorum is present may be
adjourned from time to time by Persons entitled to vote a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series represented
at the meeting and the meeting may be held as to adjourned without further
notice.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF CHICAGO,
As Trustee

By: ______________________________

<PAGE>

(REVERSE OF SECURITY)

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more
series under an Indenture, dated as of August 24, 1994 and all indentures
supplemental thereto (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and
The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee",
which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which
Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities
and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and
delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof
limited in aggregate principal amount to One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($125,000,000).

The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is subordinate and subject
in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and
this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect
thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and
shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his
or her behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his or her
attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (1)
the entire indebtedness of this Security or (2) certain restrictive covenants
and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon
compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at
the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the
Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company

4
<PAGE>

with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of
this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration
of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not
notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the
Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount
of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written
request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of
Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee
shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with
such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60
days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The
foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security
for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or interest hereon on or
after the respective due dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this
Security at the times, places and rates, and in the coin or currency, herein
prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest
on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security
Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his or her attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series
and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate
principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

5
<PAGE>

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a
like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering
the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither
the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned hereby sell(s), assign(s) and
transfer(s) unto ______________________________ the within note of H. F.
Ahmanson & Company and hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints
_____________________________ attorney to transfer said note on the books of the
