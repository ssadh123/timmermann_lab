ITEM 5.
OTHER EVENTS

As previously reported on a Form 10 and Information Statement, on June 1,
1994, Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation ("E&S" or the "COMPANY")
distributed (the "DISTRIBUTION") to its shareholders all of the outstanding
shares of common stock of its then wholly owned subsidiary, Tripos, Inc.
("TRIPOS"). The Distribution was made to holders of record of E&S common stock,
$.20 par value per share (the "E&S COMMON STOCK"), on May 25, 1994 (the "RECORD
DATE"), on the basis of one share of common stock of Tripos, $.01 par value per
share (the "TRIPOS COMMON STOCK"), for every three shares of E&S Common Stock
held on the Record Date. The Distribution resulted in all of the outstanding
shares of Tripos Common Stock being distributed to holders of E&S Common Stock
on a pro rata basis. The Tripos Common Stock is listed for trading on the
Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "TRPS."

The Company provides the following Pro Forma Financial Information with
this filing:

- Consolidated Pro Forma Statement of Earnings for year ended December
31, 1993 (see attached Schedule 1)

- Consolidated Pro Forma Statement of Earnings for three months ended
April 1, 1994 (see attached Schedule 2)

- Consolidated Pro Forma Balance Sheet dated April 1, 1994 (see attached
Schedule 3)

The unaudited consolidated pro forma statement of earnings of E&S for the
year ended December 31, 1993 (Schedule 1) and the unaudited consolidated pro
forma statement of earnings for the three months ended April 1, 1994 (Schedule
2) are presented to show the effects of the Distribution assuming the
Distribution had occurred as of the beginning of the year ended December 31,
1993. The unaudited consolidated pro forma balance sheet of E&S as of April 1,
1994 (Schedule 3) gives effect to the Distribution assuming the Distribution had
occurred on that date.

The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information does not purport
or represent what the Company's financial position or results of operations
would actually have been had the transaction in fact occurred on the dates
indicated above, nor to project the Company's financial position or results of
operations for any future date or period. In the opinion of the Company's
management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been made.
