Item 5. Other Events.

On February 26, 1994, First Financial Corporation
("FFC") and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Financial Bank,
FSB ("First Financial") completed an acquisition (the
"Acquisition") of NorthLand Bank of Wisconsin, S.S.B.
("NorthLand"). As part of the Acquisition, NorthLand was merged
with and into First Financial.

At December 31, 1993, NorthLand reported total assets of
$127.4 million and stockholder's equity of $11.4 million. Prior
to the Acquisition, NorthLand operated 8 branches in northern
Wisconsin. First Financial intends to continue to operate such
branches as First Financial banking offices.

In the Acquisition, FFC issued a total of 938,387 shares
of its common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("FFC Shares"), to
the stockholders of NorthLand Common Stock, par value $1.00 per
share (the "NorthLand Shares") in exchange for each issued and
outstanding share of NorthLand Shares. The number of FFC Shares
into which each NorthLand Share was converted equals 130% of the
"NorthLand Share Value" divided by the "FFC Share Value." In
general, the "NorthLand Share Value" is the tangible net worth of
NorthLand as of the end of January 1994. The FFC Share Value is
$15.075, which is based upon the average of the average bid
price, as quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System, for FFC
Shares for each of the five trading days immediately preceding
February 23, 1994. The Acquisition was consummated in accordance
with an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 13,
1993, among NorthLand, FFC and First Financial.
