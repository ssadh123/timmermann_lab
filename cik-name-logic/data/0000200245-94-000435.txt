SALOMON INC REPORTS A QUARTERLY NET LOSS OF
$104 MILLION

New York, October 20, 1994 - As previously
indicated, Salomon Inc today announced a
net loss of $104 million, or $1.13 per share,
for the 1994 third quarter. In the
comparable 1993 quarter, Salomon Inc earned
$20 million or $0.01 per share. For the
nine months ended September 30, 1994, the
Company recorded a net loss of $242
million, or $2.67 per share, compared with
net income of $351 million, or $2.64 per
share (fully diluted) in the comparable 1993
period.

Salomon Brothers, the Company's global
investment banking and securities business,
reported a pretax loss of $176 million for
the quarter compared with pretax earnings of
$19 million in the 1993 third quarter. For
the 1994 nine month period, Salomon Brothers
recorded a pretax loss of $547 million
compared with pretax earnings of $713 million
in
the comparable 1993 period.

Salomon Brothers' Proprietary Trading
Businesses recorded a pretax loss of $114
million
in the third quarter. Results for these
businesses tend to be volatile and are better
evaluated over longer term periods of at
least a year. For the four quarters ended
September 30, 1994, Proprietary Trading
Businesses generated pretax earnings of $487
million.

Weakness in underwriting volume and customer
trading activity continued to have an
adverse effect on Salomon Brothers' Client-
Driven Businesses in the third quarter.
Although results improved significantly from
the 1994 second quarter, these businesses
recorded a third quarter pretax loss of $62
million. Client-Driven Businesses recorded
pretax earnings of $192 million in the 1993
third quarter.

For the 1994 nine month period, Client-Driven
Businesses had a pretax loss of $526
million compared with pretax earnings of $805
million in the comparable 1993 nine
month period. Results for the 1994 nine
month period were adversely affected by
reduced customer trading volume and
underwriting activity, inventory losses, and
trading
losses incurred by certain Client-Driven
Businesses. The businesses most severely
affected were U.S. fixed income, European
secondary markets and foreign exchange.
Salomon Brothers has reduced Client-Driven
Businesses' inventories with a focus on
aged positions, particularly with respect to
mortgage securities. Further, given the

<PAGE>

results for the nine month period and the
difficult market environment, Salomon
Brothers
is closely reviewing the pace of new
initiatives in its Client-Driven Businesses.

The Phibro Division, the Company's
commodities trading business, had a pretax
loss of
$27 million in the 1994 third quarter,
compared with a pretax loss of $3 million in
the
third quarter of 1993. Despite the third
quarter loss, the Phibro Division's pretax
earnings of $105 million for the 1994 nine
month period were quite strong. In the
comparable 1993 period, the Division recorded
pretax earnings of $6 million.

Phibro USA, the Company's oil refining
business, recorded a pretax loss of $4
million for
the 1994 third quarter compared with
breakeven results in the comparable 1993
quarter.
For the nine month period, Phibro USA
recorded pretax earnings of $13 million in
1994
compared with a pretax loss of $15 million in
1993.

The Company's Corporate and Other segment
recorded pretax earnings of $31 million in
the third quarter reflecting positive results
for The Mortgage Corporation, an indirect
wholly-owned mortgage servicing subsidiary in
the United Kingdom, and favorable
developments in certain environmental matters
resulting in a reduction in the Company's
environmental reserves.

Total assets were $158 billion at September
30, 1994 and average assets for the quarter
were $175 billion. Book value per common
share was $34.50 at quarter end compared
with $37.93 at December 31, 1993. Shares
authorized for repurchase by the
Company's Board of Directors remained at 9.8
million at September 30, 1994.
