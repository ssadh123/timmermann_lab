Item 5. Other Events. 

On April 5, 1994 the U.S. District Court, acting on a motion filed by
BellSouth Corporation on December 2, 1993, ruled that American Telephone
and Telegraph Company's ("AT&T") acquisition, under a proposed merger
("Merger"), of the interests owned by McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc.
("McCaw") in certain cellular properties controlled by Regional Bell
Operating Companies would violate the antitrust consent decree entered into
by AT&T in 1982 (the "Decree"). The Court determined that AT&T must seek a
waiver of the Decree to proceed with the Merger, and that the record before
the Court was insufficient to support a waiver. Accordingly, the Court
declined to grant such a waiver without prejudice to a renewed request by
AT&T, and noted that its ruling does not absolutely foreclose the waiver. 
Rather, the Court held that AT&T must satisfy the legal standard for a
decree modification. There can be no assurance as to whether the Court
will grant any waiver, or if granted, when that will occur. 

On April 6, 1994, the California Public Utilities Commission announced
that it had granted AT&T's application to approve the Merger. This
completes the required state regulatory actions for the Merger.
