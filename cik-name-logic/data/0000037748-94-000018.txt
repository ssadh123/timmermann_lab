Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On April 7, 1994 the registrant sold its wholly-owned
subsidiary, St. Joe Minerals Corporation ("St. Joe") to an
affiliate of The Renco Group, Inc. a private investment company
based in New York. The principal asset of St. Joe is The Doe
Run Company, a Missouri general partnership ("Doe Run"). Doe
Run primarily conducts lead mining, smelting and recycling
operations. Its assets include six lead mines, four mills and
two smelters located in Missouri. 

In November 1992, the registrant announced its decision to exit
the lead business. As a consequence, the registrant's lead
business segment was classified as a discontinued operation as
of October 31, 1992 and adjusted to net realizable value. The
consideration received upon closing of the sale in April, 1994,
consisting of both cash and deferred payments, was negotiated by
the parties. The combined effect of the amount realized on the
sale and operating results from November, 1992 until the date of
the sale was within previously established discontinued
operations reserves. As a consequence, the closing of the sale
had no additional impact on the registrant's earnings beyond
what was originally recognized in fiscal 1992.
