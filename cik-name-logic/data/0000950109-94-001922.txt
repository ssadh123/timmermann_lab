WORTHEN BANKING CORPORATION
NEWS RELEASE

LITTLE ROCK, AR, (October 14, 1994) --- Andrew Melton, executive vice
president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Worthen Banking
Corporation (ASE:WOR) today announced his resignation from Worthen.

Melton, who joined Worthen Banking Corporation in 1986, stated, "After
eight and a half years of participating in Worthen's recovery and return to
the premier financial institution in Arkansas, I feel it's time to move on to
other challenges. I am confident that the remaining management team at Worthen
will achieve a smooth transition to Boatmen's."

Worthen Banking Corporation announced on August 18, 1994, that it had
entered into an agreement in which Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. (NASDAQ:BOAT)
would acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Worthen Banking Corporation in
a one-to-one stock exchange transaction. The agreement with Boatmen's to
acquire Worthen is the culmination of the record of achievement compiled by
Worthen from substantial net losses incurred 1985 - 1987 to record profits
earned during the early 1990's.

Curt Bradbury, chairman and chief executive officer of Worthen Banking
Corporation, stated, "Andrew made significant contributions to the success of
our company. He was instrumental in the expansion of Worthen's presence
through acquisitions in the most vibrant economic markets of Arkansas. We wish
him the best in his future ventures."
