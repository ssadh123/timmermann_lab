AS EXPECTED, WESTINGHOUSE ANTICIPATES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS TO BE DOWN

PITTSBURGH, March 7 -- Westinghouse Electric Corporation Chairman and 
CEO Mike Jordan today announced that, in keeping with his earlier 
indications, reported earnings per share for the first quarter are expected 
to be down approximately $0.10 per share from the $0.14 per share reported 
for the same period of 1993. Reported earnings in the first quarter of 1994 
are expected to be impacted by higher pension expense, reduced licensee 
income, and a one-time gain from the sale of two radio stations. A change 
in accounting for nuclear fuel revenues favorably affected first quarter 
1993 earnings.

Operating profit for the first quarter of 1994 is expected to be down 
approximately 10 percent compared to the same period of 1993, after 
considering the effects of higher pension expense and reduced licensee 
income in 1994, and a change in accounting for nuclear fuel revenues that 
favorably impacted the first quarter of 1993. The decline in the first 
quarter of 1994 operating profit is expected to be caused primarily by the 
nuclear energy business of the Power Systems segment, and two businesses 
within the Environmental segment, Resource Energy Systems and Controlmatic, 
both scheduled to be sold.

"I indicated that first quarter earnings would be off during the 
meeting we had with security analysts in January and, most recently, when 
we reported our 1993 year-end results, so none of this should come as a 
surprise to our stakeholders. This announcement is in keeping with my 
commitment to avoid surprises," Mr. Jordan said.

"While I am disappointed that first quarter results will not be 
better, I am pleased with the significant events that have taken place in 
the same period, including the sale of the Westinghouse Electric Supply 
Company and the Distribution and Control business, which collectively 
brought in approximately $1.4 billion in cash."

Cash proceeds from these two sales have enabled Westinghouse to 
reduce its total net debt to under $4 billion at the end of February 1994, 
down from $8.4 billion a little over a year ago.

"These and other actions taken to strengthen our balance sheet, 
enabled us to take advantage of an opportunity to make a strategic 
acquisition of Norden Systems in the first quarter to help grow our 
Electronic Systems business.

"We are committed to making fundamental change throughout 
Westinghouse that will improve earnings by reducing our costs, increasing 
productivity, and growing our core businesses. While we see this occurring 
over the next several years, we expect to begin seeing results during this 
year," Mr. Jordan said.
