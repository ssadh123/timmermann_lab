BALL CORPORATION FORECLOSES
ON VISUAL IMAGING ASSETS
- - -----------------------------------------------------------------------

MUNCIE, Ind., Sept. 8, 1994--Ball Corporation [NYSE:BLL] announced today

that it has foreclosed on its security interest with regard to certain assets

sold to SDI Virtual Reality Corporation in May. The action, which was agreed

to by SDI, returns to Ball SDI's San Diego assets only, while SDI continues to

operate its other businesses.

"The sale to SDI of the visual image generating business was consistent

with Ball's long term strategic plan," said George A. Sissel, Ball's acting

president and chief executive officer, "but SDI subsequently experienced

difficulty meeting its financial commitments to us and contractual commitments

to customers and others. We felt it was in everyone's interest for us to step

in quickly."

Sissel said Ball will work closely with SDI's affected customers while

examining other options for concluding Ball's participation in the visual image

generating arena. Ball's 1993 restructuring charge contemplated the

disposition of the visual image generating product line. Sissel said it is

impossible to determine at this time what additional costs, if any, Ball may

incur as a result of the foreclosure.

Ball manufactures glass and metal containers for the food and beverage

industries and also provides aerospace and communications products and services

to government and commercial customers.
