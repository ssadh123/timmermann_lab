The accompanying pro forma consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended November 30, 1993 assumes
the acquisition of the properties as if they had occurred on December 1, 1992. This pro forma information is based
upon the historical statements of the Trust after giving effect to the acquisition of these properties. Rental income 
and operating expenses for the peroid of the Trust's ownership are deducted as pro forma adjustments.

The pro forma statement has been prepared by MGI Properties management. The pro forma consolidated 
statement of earnings may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred if the acquisitions had
been in effect on the dates indicated. Also, they may not be indicative of results that may be achieved in the
future. The pro forma consolidated statement of earnings should be read in conjunction with MGI Properties
audited financial statements as of November 30, 1993.

1. Rental and other income includes income of 1.0 million received in connection with non-recurring amendment 
and lease assignment. Rents and levels of occupancy in place for the twelve month period are not indicative of 
the experience of the Trust for its period of ownership during 1993.

2. The reduction in interest income is due to the anticipated use of cash which would have been required to
purchase the properties if they had been acquired on December 1, 1992.

3. The adjustment for depreciation was based upon an allocation of the purchase price to land and building with
depreciation being taken over a forty year life using the straight line method.

4. The increase in interest expense is due to the assumption of debt used to acquire the properties which
would have been outstanding for the period from December 1, 1992 to May 6, 1993, the date which the Trust
received the proceeds from its common stock offering. The acquisition of the properties on December 1, assumes 
the Trust borrowed $24,732,000 at a floating rate of 6%.

We have audited the accompanying historical summary of gross income and direct
operating expenses of 326 Ballardvale Street (Historical Summary) for the year

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical Summary is free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 
of the Historical Summary. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.

The accompanying Historical Summary was prepared for the purpose of complying
with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission as
described in note 2, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of 326

326 Ballardvale Street (the property) is located in Wilmington, Massachusetts
and is owned by MGI Properties.

(2) Basis of Presentation

The Historical Summary has been prepared for the purpose of complying with Rule
3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not a
complete presentation of the property's revenues and expenses. The Historical
Summary has been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting.

Gross Income
The property leases space under various operating lease agreements with its
tenants. These leases include provisions under which the property is reimbursed
for certain common area, real estate tax and insurance costs. Certain leases
contain renewal options for various periods at various rental rates.

Base rentals are reported as income over the lease term as they become
receivable under the provisions of the leases. However, when rentals vary from
a straight-line basis due to short-term rent abatements or escalating rents
during the lease term, the income is recognized based on effective rental rates.

Minimum rents to be received from tenants under executed operating leases in
effect at December 31, 1993 are as follows:

of the property.

depreciation, amortization, management fees and leasing commissions are excluded
from the Historical Summary.
