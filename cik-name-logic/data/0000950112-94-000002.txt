Item 5. Other Events
------------

On December 22, 1993, Paramount Communications Inc.

("Paramount") terminated the Amended and Restated 

Agreement and Plan of Merger with Viacom Inc. ("Viacom"). In

addition, on December 22, 1993, Paramount entered into an

Exemption Agreement with Viacom (the "Exemption Agreement"). The

Exemption Agreement provides for the amendment of the Rights

Agreement relating to Paramount's Common Stock Purchase Rights

and the taking of appropriate action so that restrictions on

business combinations contained in Article XI of Paramount's

Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Section 203 of the

Delaware General Corporation Law shall not apply to the

consummation of the pending tender offer by Viacom for Paramount

Common Stock (the "Viacom Offer") if the minimum condition with

respect to the Viacom Offer, among other conditions, is

satisfied. The Exemption Agreement will thereby allow Paramount

stockholders, if they so choose, to have their shares of

Paramount Common Stock ("Shares") accepted for payment pursuant

to the Viacom Offer.

On December 22, 1993, Paramount and QVC Network, Inc.

("QVC") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended,

the "QVC Merger Agreement"), which provides for, among other

things, (i) the amendment of the pending tender offer by QVC for

Paramount Common Stock (as so amended, the "Revised QVC Offer"),

which offer had provided for the purchase of approximately 51% of

<PAGE>

Page 3 of 8

the outstanding Shares at a price of $90 per Share, to (A)

increase the purchase price for the Shares to $92 per Share, (B)

amend the conditions to the QVC Offer to conform with the

conditions set forth in Annex A to the QVC Merger Agreement and

(C) extend the expiration date of the QVC Offer until 12:00

midnight on January 7, 1994 and (ii) the institution of amended

and definitive terms of the proposed merger which would follow

consummation of the QVC Offer (as so amended, the "Revised QVC

Second-Step Merger"), which terms had provided for, subject to

change by QVC, the exchange of (1) 1.43 shares of QVC Common

Stock and (2) 0.32 shares of a new series of QVC Cumulative

Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock for each remaining Share

and which now provide for the binding commitment of QVC to

exchange (x) 1.43 shares of QVC Common Stock, (y) 0.32 shares of

a new series of 6% Cumulative Non-Convertible Exchangeable

Preferred Stock and (z) 0.32 Warrants to purchase QVC Common

Stock for each remaining Share.

A copy of the press release of Paramount, dated

December 22, 1993, relating to the above-described transactions

is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 22, 1993

NEW YORK, Dec. 22 -- Paramount Communications Inc. announced today
that it had entered into a merger agreement with QVC Network Inc. The
merger agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of
Paramount this morning. The Board will recommend the QVC proposal to
its shareholders. The agreement provides for a merger of the two
companies following completion of a tender offer by QVC for 61,607,894
shares, or approximately 51%, of the outstanding common stock of
Paramount. Under the terms of the agreement, QVC will amend its
existing tender offer to increase the price from $90 to $92 per share
in cash.

Martin S. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer of
Paramount, said: "The merger agreement with QVC included bidding
procedures previously adopted by the Board of Directors of Paramount. 
In addition, Paramount reported that it had also entered into an
agreement with Viacom, Inc. which incorporated the same bidding
procedures. These procedures," he stated, "are designed to provide
the highest value for Paramount shareholders by creating a level
playing field. They allow existing bidders to increase their bids.
In addition, the procedures give the shareholders of Paramount an
opportunity to choose should there be more than one offer outstanding
in the final stage of the bidding process. Moreover, the merger
agreement does not prohibit any new bids by a third party."

Paramount also announced that in connection with the execution of
its merger agreement with QVC it had terminated its existing merger
agreement with Viacom.

Paramount also said that in connection with the receipt of bids
on December 20, 1993, Viacom advised Paramount that it was considering
raising its offer.

Following completion of the tender offer, under the terms of the
merger agreement, each Paramount share that is not purchased in the
tender offer will be acquired in a second-step merger in exchange for
1.43 shares of QVC common stock, .32 shares of a new series of 6%
cumulative non-convertible exchangeable preferred stock of QVC and .32
warrants to purchase one share of QVC common stock per whole warrant
at a price of $70.34 per share exercisable at any time prior to the
tenth anniversary of the merger.

Based on December 21, 1993, closing prices of QVC, the value of
the consideration in the second step merger would be approximately $76
per share, and the blended value of the total consideration would be
approximately $84.

The New series of QVC preferred stock will bear dividends at a
rate of 6% per annum, payable quarterly, will have a liquidation
preference of $50 per share, will be redeemable by QVC at declining
redemption premiums at any time after the fifth anniversary of the QVC
second-step merger and will be exchangeable by QVC after the third
anniversary of the QVC second-step merger into QVC 6% junior
subordinated debentures. Each QVC warrant will entitle the holder to
purchase one share of QVC Common Stock per whole warrant at a price of
$70.34 per share, will be exercisable at the holder's option at any
time prior to the tenth anniversary of the QVC second-step merger,
will be exercisable using cash or an equivalent amount of liquidation
preference of new QVC preferred stock or principal amount of 6% Junior
Subordinated Debentures, and will be callable by QVC at $15 per
warrant on and after the fifth anniversary of the QVC second-step
merger.
