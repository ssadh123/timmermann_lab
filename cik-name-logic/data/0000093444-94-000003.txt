SPS TECHNOLOGIES
TO REDUCE NON-DIRECT EMPLOYMENT 10 PERCENT,
RECORD FOURTH QUARTER RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

NEWTOWN, PA, January 5, 1994--SPS Technologies (NYSE - ST)
today reported that it is reducing employment by over 200 non-
direct employees or approximately 10 percent of its total non-
direct work force. No reduction of direct labor employees is
anticipated at this time. SPS also announced that it has
substantially reduced its corporate staff and is moving its
corporate headquarters to the Company's Jenkintown, Pennsylvania,
plant. These actions, plus reductions of its executive payroll
and other non-essential expenses are being taken to reduce
overhead costs.

The Company expects to record a fourth quarter restructuring
charge of $20 to $25 million to reflect the costs associated with
the aforementioned actions; modifications to the previously
announced restructuring plan; increased costs to complete plant
consolidations; and the write off of previously deferred costs of
approximately $10 million required as a result of the protracted
period of disposal of the remaining assets held for sale. The
plan modifications include the Company's decision to retain its
European industrial fastener businesses and its hard ferrite
magnetic materials business, which previously had been held for
sale.

It is anticipated that as a result of the above-mentioned
restructuring charge, the Company will be in violation of certain
loan agreement covenants. SPS believes that the cost reduction
program described above will be favorably received by its lenders
and that new covenants will be negotiated.
