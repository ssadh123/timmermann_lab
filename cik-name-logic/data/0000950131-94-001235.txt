WMX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. PROPOSES TO ACQUIRE
CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.'S PUBLIC SHARES

Oak Brook, Illinois, July 28, 1994 -- WMX Technologies, Inc., the global 
environmental services company, announced today that its Board of Directors has 
approved a proposal to acquire all of the Chemical Waste Management, Inc. shares
which it does not already own.

Under the WMX Technologies proposal, each holder of Chemical Waste 
Management shares other than WMX would receive .27 of a WMX Technologies share 
for each share of Chemical Waste Management common stock held.

WMX Technologies owns approximately 78.6 percent of Chemical Waste 
Management's 209.1 million outstanding shares. The proposed transaction would 
result in the issuance of approximately an additional 12.1 million WMX 
Technologies shares. On July 28, 1994, the closing price of Chemical Waste 
Management common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $7.875 per share, and
for WMX was $29.125 per share.

"Our offer recognizes the benefits we believe would flow from the 
integration of our company and Chemical Waste Management," said Dean L. 
Buntrock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WMX Technologies. "It 
underscores our commitment to seeing the WMX-affiliated group of companies 
retain its leadership of the hazardous waste industry."

WMX Technologies said that the proposed transaction would take the form of
a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of WMX into Chemical Waste Management.
Under the proposal, the merger would be subject to the approval of the holders
of a majority of Chemical Waste Management's outstanding shares other than
shares held by WMX who vote on it at a special meeting of Chemical Waste
Management stockholders called for that purpose.

In other action, the Company announced that it was undertaking a 
comprehensive review of WMX Technologies' operations and financial strategies 
and its organizational structure in order to consider other potential strategic 
actions intended to enhance stockholder value. The Board authorized management 
to commence discussions with external financial and strategic advisors to be 
retained to assist with the review. No date was set for the completion of the 
project, but the Company indicated it expected the matter to be discussed at the
Board's annual strategic planning meeting in late January 1995.

WMX Technologies is the world's leading environmental services company.
Based in Oak Brook, Illinois, the Company operates through five principal
subsidiaries: Waste Management, Inc., Chemical Waste Management, Inc.,
Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., Rust International Inc. and Waste Management
International plc.
