Item 2. Acquisition and Disposition of Assets

Since the last Form 8-K filed by New Plan Realty Trust (the
"Company") dated May 20, 1994, as amended by the Form 8-K/A filed
by the Company dated June 10, 1994 and the Form 8-K/A filed by
the Company dated July 6, 1994, the Company, on July 1, 1994,
acquired Sedgefield Apartments, located in Florence, South
Carolina. Sedgefield Apartments is a residential apartment
complex consisting of 280 apartment units on approximately 18.7
acres. Sedgefield Apartments is currently 93% occupied.

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Statements and
Exhibits.

(a) and (b) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired and 
Pro Forma
Financial Information.

The purchase price of the acquired property described in
Item 2 above (the "Property") was approximately $7,700,000, all
of which was paid by the Company in cash. The purchase price of
the Property represents less than 10% of the total unaudited
assets of the Company.

However, because the Property when added to prior unaudited
acquisitions exceeds 10% of the unaudited assets of the Company,
audited statements of revenues and certain operating expenses
relative to the Property and pro forma condensed financial
information reflecting the acquisition of the Property will be
filed under cover of Form 8-K/A as soon as practicable, but not
later than 60 days after this report on Form 8-K.

(c) Exhibits.

None.
