FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BURLINGTON NORTHERN BOARD REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT
TO SANTA FE MERGER

Fort Worth, TX, Oct. 6--The Board of Directors of Burlington Northern Inc. (BN) 
today repeated its commitment to consummate the merger of BN and Santa Fe 
Pacific Corporation (Santa Fe), as announced on June 30. The Board reaffirmed 
its intent to file the Santa Fe merger application with the Interstate Commerce 
Commission (ICC) next week.

BN said the UP proposal would eliminate choice and competition for customers 
throughout the west and increase UP's existing dominance in the Western United 
States. Among its many adverse impacts, the UP proposal would eliminate Santa 
Fe's competition to the UP on the critical Chicago and Midwest to California 
route. In addition, many Kansas and Oklahoma wheat farmers would be captive to 
the UP to move their crops to Gulf ports.

While the BN-Santa Fe merger is an end-to-end combination, more than 5,000 of 
Santa Fe's 8,500-mile route system parallels and overlaps UP's system, which 
means less competition and greater employee impact. The UP and Santa Fe systems 
are essentially parallel from Los Angeles to Chicago and from Kansas to Texas. 
Savings from the UP proposal will come at the expense of rail service, 
employment and facility reductions due to overlapping systems.

BN pointed out that the Union Pacific (UP) has conceded that its proposal will 
not receive ICC approval without massive protective arrangements for other 
carriers. UP wrongly believes that negotiating with other carriers will 
eliminate the substantial anti-competitive impacts of the merger. In contrast, 
the BN-Santa Fe merger enhances competition.
