The Travelers Inc.
Current Report on Form 8-K

Item 5. Other Events

The Travelers Inc.'s ("Travelers") operating earnings for
the fourth quarter, ended December 31, 1993, increased 80% to
$276.6 million from $153.3 million in the 1992 period. Earnings
per share from operations were $1.10, up 67% from $0.66 per share.

For the full year 1993, operating earnings reached $899.5
million, with operating earnings per share up 41% to $3.67 per
share. This compares with 1992 results of $593.0 million, or
$2.61 per share.

Net Income for the Quarter and Year
-----------------------------------

Net income for the 1993 fourth quarter was $297.9 million,
or $1.19 per share, reflecting, as well as operating income, an
additional $21.3 million, or $0.09 per share, from the reversal
of a deferred tax liability no longer required with 100%
ownership of The Travelers Corporation ("old Travelers"), now the
Travelers Insurance Companies subsidiary. This compares to net
income of $221.3 million, or $0.96 per share, in the 1992
quarter, which reflected net gains of $68.0 million, or $0.30 per
share, from sales of various subsidiaries and affiliates.

For the full year 1993, net income reached $915.6 million,
or $3.74 per share, reflecting, in addition to operating
earnings:

- $109.2 million in reported investment portfolio gains and an
$8.1 million gain from the sale of subsidiaries and affiliates

- A charge of $16.7 million related to the cumulative effect
of FAS 106

- A charge of $17.7 million related to the cumulative effect
of FAS 112, which was adopted retroactively to the beginning
of 1993 

- A $65.0 million provision for one-time expenses related to
the Smith Barney and Shearson transaction. 

2

<PAGE>

This compares to 1992 net income of $728.1 million, or $3.22
per share, which reflected, in addition to operating earnings,
reported investment portfolio gains and net gains from sales
of subsidiaries and affiliates of $163.2 million and a one-time
charge of $28.1 million from the cumulative effect of FAS 109.

Investment Services
-------------------

Smith Barney Shearson earned $145.1 million in the quarter,
which includes the contribution from the Shearson acquisition for
the full period. This compares with $34.9 million reported by
Smith Barney alone in last year's quarter. For the full year,
the firm earned a record $371.0 million (before a $65.0 million
after-tax provision for one-time expenses related to the Shearson
acquisition), up from $156.9 million earned by Smith Barney in
1992. These outstanding results reflect the continued
development of the firm's capabilities in investment banking and
capital markets trading as well as its significant position in
retail brokerage in a year of robust markets. The pretax profit
margin for 1993 reached 20.9%, and the firm returned 26% after
tax on its equity for the year.

When compared with Smith Barney in the 1992 quarter, the
combined firm recorded more than a four-fold rise in commission
revenues, more than an eight-fold increase in asset management
fees, and more than triple the amount of revenues from principal
trading. For the year, commissions and net interest income more
than doubled, asset management fees increased 336%, principal
trading revenues rose 84%, and investment banking revenues jumped
54%. 

The Mutual Funds and Asset Management sector reported a 9%
gain in earnings for the quarter to $8.4 million and a 4% gain
for the 1993 year to $32.5 million. Assets under management at
both American Capital Management & Research and RCM Capital
Management rose every quarter in 1993 versus the prior year,
reaching $16.7 billion at American Capital, up 15%, and $24.5
billion at RCM, up 3%. Mutual fund sales at American Capital
continued to rise in the quarter, ending the year up 38%.

With the addition of the businesses acquired in the 
Shearson transaction, total third-party assets under management 
at the company leaped 114% to $116 billion in 1993. 

Consumer Finance Services
-------------------------

Earnings from Consumer Finance increased to $55.5 million
for the quarter, up 8% from the 1992 period. For the year,
operating earnings reached a record $209.1 million, up 8% from
$193.5 million.

3

<PAGE>

The improvement in results is largely attributable to a
substantial year-over-year decline in losses and a 9% increase in
receivables outstanding to $6.34 billion at year-end, up from
$5.79 billion at December 31, 1992. Charge-offs remained at the
record low levels reached last quarter at 2.25%, down from 2.79%
at the end of 1992; 60+ days delinquencies were 2.21% in the
quarter, down from 2.55% in the period last year. 

Insurance Services
------------------

Earnings from Primerica Financial Services for the fourth
quarter were $49.5 million, a 6% increase versus last year's
period. For the year operating earnings reached $188.9 million,
up from $187.3 million.

Sales of new life insurance in the quarter were $13.3
billion, up from $11.3 billion in the 1992 period, bringing full
year sales to $48.3 billion in face amount versus $46.2 billion
for 1992. For the fourth consecutive quarter, total life
insurance in force increased, reaching $309.3 billion, up from
$302.3 billion at year-end 1992, reflecting both higher sales
levels and a significant improvement in policy persistency.

Mutual fund sales (at net asset value) by the PFS sales
force continued to soar, increasing 25% for the quarter to $326.8
million, and reaching almost $1.3 billion for the year. Assets
under management in the Common Sense(R) Trust family of funds,
which account for the majority of PFS's sales, reached $3.l
billion at year end. The loan products marketed by PFS also
continued to grow in popularity, with net receivables outstanding
reaching $765.4 million at the end of 1993, up 57% from year-end
1992 levels.

Transport Life Insurance Company (formerly reported with
Voyager as part of Specialty Life and Health) earned $6.6 million
in the quarter, down from $8.0 million. For the year, operating
earnings were $25.6 million, down from $29.9 million. The
declines are principally attributable to the absence of the
employee benefits business that had been sold to "old Travelers"
when Primerica first made its 27% equity investment at the end of
1992.

The Gulf Insurance Group recorded a decline in earnings for
the 1993 quarter to $7.3 million, and a slight increase in
operating earnings for the full year to $29.7 million versus
$29.2 million in 1992, before "old Travelers'" minority interest.
The combined ratio increased in the quarter to 97.8% versus
94.7%, principally as a result of higher storm-related claims.

Corporate and Other
-------------------

The Corporate and Other segment contributed $29.1 million of
income in the quarter compared to a net expense of $4.2 million
in the 1992 quarter. Corporate expenses were $28.1 million, up
from $18.8 million, with the increase resulting from lower income
from miscellaneous investments and higher interest costs related
to increased borrowings to finance acquisitions, offset by lower
interest rates. Corporate expenses are net of contributions from
retained lines of Voyager business of $2.6 million and $2.5
million, respectively, in the 1993 and 1992 quarters. The 27%
"old Travelers" investment in effect for the 1993 quarter

4

<PAGE>
contributed $35.9 million, while for the 1992 quarter, Fingerhut
Companies, Inc., a former subsidiary of the Company, contributed
$14.6 million. The 1993 Corporate and Other contribution
also includes the reversal of a $21.3 million deferred tax
liability no longer required with 100% ownership of "old
Travelers."

For the 1993 year, the segment contributed $86.9 million
compared to a net expense of $35.9 million in 1992. Corporate
expenses were up, for the reasons already cited, to $70.2 million
versus $63.8 million, net of $9.8 million and $10.1 million,
respectively, from Voyager contributions in 1993 and 1992. The
27% "old Travelers" investment contributed $127.7 million to
operating earnings for the 1993 year, as well as $13.1 million in
reported portfolio gains, compared with a $25.7 million Fingerhut
contribution in 1992. 

The Travelers Inc. is the surviving corporation of the
acquisition on December 31, 1993 by Primerica Corporation of The
Travelers Corporation ("old Travelers"). This diversified
financial services company is engaged in life and property and
casualty insurance services, investment services and consumer
finance. The principal companies that operate under the familiar
Travelers umbrella now include: Primerica Financial Services,
The Travelers Insurance Company, The Travelers Indemnity Company,
Transport Life Insurance and Gulf Insurance Group; Smith Barney
Shearson, American Capital Management & Research and RCM Capital
Management; and Commercial Credit and Primerica Bank.

The results reported herein are only for operations of the
company formerly known as Primerica Corporation; beginning with
the first quarter of 1994, ending March 31, reported results will
include the businesses of the "old Travelers." At year end 1993,
The Travelers had assets of approximately $100 billion.
