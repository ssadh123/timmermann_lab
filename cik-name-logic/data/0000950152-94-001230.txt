Report of Independent Auditors
------------------------------

Shareholder and Board of Directors
Northshore Mining Company

We have audited the accompanying statement of consolidated financial position
of Cyprus Northshore Mining Corporation and consolidated subsidiary as of
December 31, 1993, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash
flows and shareholder's equity for the year then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cyprus Northshore
Mining Corporation and consolidated subsidiary at December 31, 1993, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CYPRUS NORTHSHORE MINING CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION: Cyprus Northshore Mining Corporation (the "Company")
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cyprus Amax Minerals Company ("Cyprus"). The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cyprus Silver Bay
Power Corporation ("Power"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. All
intercompany balances and transactions between Company and Power have been
eliminated.

BUSINESS: The Company's primary business is the production and sale of iron
ore pellets. Crude ore is mined at Babbitt, Minnesota and railed to Silver Bay,
Minnesota where it is concentrated, pelletized and shipped primarily to
integrated steel company customers by lake carriers. One customer accounts for
72.4 percent of the Company's revenues. Electric power is generated at Power's
115 megawatt power station located at Silver Bay, Minnesota for use in iron ore
processing with excess capacity sold to a utility company.

CASH: The Company maintains small cash accounts for local expenditures. All
cash receipts from sales and cash disbursements for employment, material and
service costs are transacted through Cyprus cash accounts (see Note A).

INVENTORIES: Product inventories, primarily finished pellets, are stated at
the lower of cost or market. The cost of product inventories is determined
using the first-in, first-out method. The cost of supplies and coal
inventories is determined by the average cost method.

PROPERTIES: Properties are stated on the basis of cost. Depreciation of plant
and equipment is computed principally by the straight-line method based on
estimated useful lives. Mine development costs are charged to operations as
incurred. Gains or losses upon retirement or replacement of equipment and
facilities are credited or charged to income, as appropriate.

INCOME TAXES: The operations of the Company are included in the consolidated
federal income tax returns filed by Cyprus, the parent company. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect income tax expense on a
separate company basis. The Company has recorded income tax based on statutory
tax rates applied to the Company's reported book income adjusted for permanent
differences. 

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS: In December, 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board ("FASB") issued Statement 106, "Accounting for Postretirement Benefits 
Other than Pensions" which requires that the projected future expense of 
providing postretirement benefits, such as health care and life insurance, be 
recognized as employees render service instead of when the benefits are paid. 
Statement 106 requires the assumption that present benefit plans continue at 
escalating costs. The Company adopted the provisions of this standard in its 
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1992.

<PAGE> 9
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

CYPRUS NORTHSHORE MINING CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: In November, 1992, the FASB issued Statement 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." Statement 112 requires
accrual basis accounting for benefits provided to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement. Although Statement 112 is effective
for years beginning after December 15, 1993, the Company adopted provisions of
this standard in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1992.

CONTINGENCIES: The Company's policy is to conduct business in a manner that
promotes environmental quality. The Company's environmental obligations have
been recognized based on specific estimates for known conditions and required
investigations. Any potential insurance recoveries have not been reflected in
the determination of the reserve. At December 31, 1993, the Company had an
environmental reserve of $1,198,000, of which $12,000 was current.
Environmental expenditures under current laws and regulations are not expected
to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE A - INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNT WITH CYPRUS

The intercompany account with Cyprus included in the statement of financial
position represents a net balance as the result of various transactions between
the Company and Cyprus. The account is non-interest bearing and is settled
every six months by an adjustment to capital in excess of par value of shares.
The balance is primarily the result of the Company's participation in Cyprus'
central cash management program, wherein virtually all the Company's cash is
received by Cyprus and all significant cash disbursements are made by Cyprus.
Other transactions include the Company's calculated share of the current
portion of Cyprus' consolidated federal income tax liability, and corporate
charges incurred by Cyprus on behalf of the Company. An analysis of
transactions in the intercompany account for the year ended December 31, 1993
follows:

NOTE B - RETIREMENT BENEFITS

PENSION PLANS
- - -------------
A defined benefit pension plan covering all hourly employees of the Company is
sponsored by the Company, and a defined benefit pension plan covering all
salaried employees of Cyprus, including all salaried employees of the Company,
is sponsored by Cyprus. The plans are noncontributory and salaried pension
plan benefits generally are based on employees' years of service and average
earnings for a defined period prior to retirement; hourly pension plan benefits
are based on employees' years of service at a defined rate. Pension costs are
funded to the extent necessary to meet Federal requirements.

The components of 1993 pension cost attributed to the Company were as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(In Thousands)
------------ 
<S> <C>
Service cost-benefits earned during the period $ 508
Interest cost on projected benefit obligation 185
Actual return on plan assets (137)
Net amortization and deferral 5
--------

Total pension cost $ 561
========
</TABLE>

The Company's pension funds were held in the Cyprus Minerals Master Trust with
the funds contributed by Cyprus and its other affiliated companies. Plan
assets principally include diversified marketable equity securities and
corporate and government debt securities. Salaried plan assets have been
estimated. The following table presents a reconciliation of the funded status
of the Company's plans at December 31, 1993.

The discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels used in
determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation at
December 31, 1993 were 7.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. The expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets was 9 percent in 1993.

NOTE B - RETIREMENT BENEFITS - Continued

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
- - -------------------------------------------
In addition to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, the Company
currently provides retirement health care and life insurance benefits. The
medical plans provide benefits for most employees who reach normal, or in
certain cases, early retirement age while employed by the Company. The
postretirement medical plans are contributory, with annual adjustments to
retiree contributions, and contain certain other cost-sharing features such as
deductibles and coinsurance. The Company's practice is to prefund a portion of
the following year's projected medical cost in amounts determined at the
discretion of management.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the funded status of the
Company's plans at December 31, 1993.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 includes the following

<CAPTION>
(In Thousands)
------------ 
<S> <C>
Service cost $ 320
Interest cost 85
--------

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 405
========
</TABLE>

The incremental increase in 1993 postretirement benefit cost was $401,000. The
weighted-average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered benefits was 14 percent for 1993, 13.5 percent for 1994, decreasing .5
percent per year for 13 years reaching 7 percent in 2006 and remaining at that
level thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported. For example, changing the assumed health care cost trend
rate by one percentage point would change the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 1993, by $56,000 and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit
cost for 1993 by $14,000.

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 7.5 percent at December 31, 1993.

SAVINGS PLAN
- - ------------
Cyprus sponsors a defined contribution savings plan covering all
non-represented employees of Cyprus, including all employees of the Company.
Contributions by employees of up to 16 percent of base pay are matched by 75%
of the first 6 percent of base pay by the Company. The Company matching
contribution may only be used to purchase common stock of Cyprus. Total
purchases for the year ended December 31, 1993 were $446,000.

NOTE D - COMMITMENTS

During 1991, Power and Northern States Power Company (the "Utility") entered
into a 20-year contract which commits Power to make available to the Utility 40
megawatts of excess capacity. Revenue received by Power for this commitment is
subject to escalation. The contract is based on Power maintaining a Qualifying
Facility ("QF") status which obligates Power to maintain steam co-generation
capability. Loss of QF status would reduce revenues received by Power. The
contract may be terminated by either party for breach or force majeure
continuing for 12 months and is at present in good standing.

NOTE E - LITIGATION

The Company is periodically involved in litigation incidental to its
operations. Management believes that any pending litigation will not result in
material liability in relation to the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

NOTE F - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On September 30, 1994, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc acquired, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary Cliffs Minnesota Minerals Company, all of the outstanding shares of
stock of the Company (renamed Northshore Mining Company) and Power (renamed
Silver Bay Power Company) from Cyprus.

PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC

The accompanying pro forma combined statements of operations for the
year ended December 31, 1993 and the nine months ended September 30, 1994 give
effect to the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of stock of Cyprus
Northshore Mining Corporation (renamed Northshore Mining Company) and its
consolidated subsidiary, Cyprus Silver Bay Power Corporation (renamed Silver
Bay Power Company) by Cliffs Minnesota Minerals Company, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, from Cyprus Amax Minerals Company
("Cyprus") on September 30, 1994. The pro forma information is based on the
historic financial statements of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and Cyprus Northshore
Mining Corporation giving effect to the transaction under the purchase method
of accounting and the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying notes to
the pro forma combined financial statements.

The pro forma combined statements of operations have been prepared by
the management of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc based upon the financial statements of
Cyprus Northshore Mining Corporation. The pro forma adjustments are based upon
the preliminary estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The final allocation of the purchase price will be made
when the complete study of the fair value of the assets and liabilities has
been finalized. The pro forma combined financial statements may not be
indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination
had occurred on January 1, 1993 or which may occur in the future. The pro
forma combined financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc included in the
annual report on Form 10-K and Cyprus Northshore Mining Corporation contained
elsewhere herein for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the unaudited interim
financial statements of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc included in Form 10-Q and Cyprus
Northshore Mining Corporation contained elsewhere herein for the nine months
ended September 30, 1994. A pro forma statement of financial position has not
been included since the transaction has been recorded in the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc as reported in Form
10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 1994.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC

December 31, 1993 and September 30, 1994

NOTE A - PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

Pro forma adjustments relating to the pro forma combined statements of
operations have been provided assuming the acquisition was consummated on
January 1, 1993. The pro forma adjustments for the year ended December 31,
1993 are as follows:

(a) Elimination of investment income on acquisition cash purchase
price, $3.6 million.

(b) Elimination of a non-recurring recovery on a casualty loss,
$.4 million.

(c) Depreciation expense increased to reflect the fair value of
the assets acquired, $.5 million. Write-off of deferred
maintenance, $.7 million.

(d) Favorable tax effect of pro forma adjustments, $2.0 million.

The pro forma adjustments for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 are as
follows:

(e) Depreciation expense increased to reflect the fair value of
the assets acquired, $.2 million. Write-off of deferred
maintenance, $.5 million.

(f) Favorable tax effect of pro forma adjustments, $.3 million.

NOTE B - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

The pro forma combined statements of operations include administrative
expense charges for the year ended December 31, 1993, and the nine months ended
September 30, 1994, by Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, parent of Cyprus
Northshore Mining Corporation, which have been considered by management of
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc to be comparable to administrative expense charges which
would have been incurred by Cyprus Northshore Mining Corporation if the
acquisition by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc had taken place January 1, 1993.

NOTE C - INVESTMENT INCOME

Income from Cleveland-Cliffs Inc investments has been adjusted for the
year ended December 31, 1993 for the effect of the acquisition cash purchase
price, and has not been adjusted for the nine months ended September 30, 1994
in the pro forma combined statements of operations. Management believes there
was no investment income in 1994 attributable to cash that would have been
invested in the acquisition.
