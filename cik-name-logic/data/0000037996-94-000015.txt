Item 5. Other Events.

As a result of the gradual economic recovery in Western Europe
and the restructuring actions undertaken by Ford in Europe during
1993, the operating results of Ford's European automotive
operations (excluding Jaguar's operating results and the
acquisition costs relating to Jaguar) are expected to improve
substantially in 1994, compared with 1993. (In 1993, Ford's
European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) lost $407
million.) In the first quarter of 1994, Ford's European automotive
operations (excluding Jaguar) earned $108 million, compared with
$19 million in the first quarter of 1993.

In the June 27, 1994 edition of Automotive News, Mr. Albert
Caspers, a Vice President of Ford Motor Company and the Chairman of
Ford of Europe Incorporated ("Ford of Europe"), was quoted to have
said that Ford of Europe would earn a substantial profit in 1994. 
This is a misinterpretation. Mr. Caspers intended that the word
"substantial" characterize the expected improvement in operating
results in 1994 compared with 1993, not the level of profitability,
of Ford's European automotive operations.
