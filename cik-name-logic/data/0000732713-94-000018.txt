Item 5. Other Events

Boosted by continued strong customer growth in its core network
services and wireless businesses, BellSouth Corporation reported
the best third quarter in its history. Earnings per share (EPS) of
$1.01 increased from a reported 88 cents in the same quarter of
1993, marking the third time in a row BellSouth has had record EPS
for a calendar quarter.

Last year's third quarter EPS reflected unusual charges totaling 9
cents per share for the nine-month impact of the higher corporate
income tax rate and debt refinancing. Excluding the unusual
charges, third quarter 1993 EPS on an operating basis was 97 cents.

Net income was $499.5 million in the third quarter of 1994,
compared with $434.6 million in the same quarter of 1993 ($484.5
million before the unusual charges). Revenues of $4.20 billion
were up 4.6 percent compared with the third quarter a year earlier.
Quarterly operating expenses increased 3.2 percent.

Buoyed by a solid regional economy and strong demand from consumers
for second telephone lines, BellSouth's access line growth
continued its brisk 1994 pace in the third quarter. The largest
base of customer access lines in the country grew to 19,993,200,
increasing by a third quarter record of 246,800. This is an annual
growth rate of 4.4 percent. So far in 1994, BellSouth has
connected nearly 5,000 net new customers per business day to its
wireline telecommunications network.

BellSouth's cellular business also continued its remarkable growth,
both in the U.S. and abroad. Based on BellSouth's ownership
percentages, U.S. cellular customers increased to 1,929,800, up
546,100, or 39 percent, since last September 30. Domestic net
income was $61.3 million.

In overseas markets, BellSouth's cellular customers increased to
309,100, 113 percent more than a year earlier. The third quarter
of 1994 also saw the company's first wholly owned long distance
operation, BellSouth Chile, inaugurate domestic and international
service in that country. Already in the fourth quarter the company
has announced a memorandum of understanding with China Unicom that
would make BellSouth one of the major and earliest partners in
building cellular, wireless and long distance networks in the
world's largest country.
