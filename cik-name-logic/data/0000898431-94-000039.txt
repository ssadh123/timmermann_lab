FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

SOUTHBURY, CONNECTICUT, October 13, 1994 -- Amdura Corporation
(NYSE:ADU) today announced that it has entered into a definitive
Stipulation of Settlement with the representatives of the
plaintiff class in the case of Saul Jones v. Amdura Corporation,
et al. (United States District Court for the District of
Colorado, Case No. 90-F-167, consolidated with Case No. 90-F-
500). The Jones case, filed in January 1990, was brought on
behalf of a class of persons who purchased Amdura's preferred or
common stock during certain periods prior to Amdura's filing of a
voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, and alleged claims under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to the effect that Amdura's public business and
financial disclosures were materially false or misleading during
those periods. Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, Amdura
will pay $500,000 in cash and issue approximately 564,302 shares
of its common stock.

Amdura expects that the United States District Court for the
District of Colorado will preliminarily approve the Stipulation
of Settlement on or about October 18, 1994. Final settlement of
the Jones case is subject to a number of substantive and
procedural conditions, including the receipt of such preliminary
approval, mailing of Notices of Settlement to claimants, and
final approval of the settlement by the District Court. Amdura
anticipates that completion of these procedures will occur over
the next three to six months, with the proceeds of the settlement
being distributed to holders of proved claims thereafter.

Pursuant to an order issued by Judge John L. Kane, Jr. of the
United States District Court for the District of Colorado on
August 3, 1994 (the effectiveness of which has been stayed) in an
appeal by the plaintiff class of certain bankruptcy orders,
certain bankruptcy proofs of claim in the Jones case, which had
been disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court prior to the October 1991
effectiveness of the confirmation of Amdura's bankruptcy Plan of
Reorganization, were to be reconsidered, and the Bankruptcy
Court's order confirming the Plan was to be reversed. Pending
finalization of the settlement, the parties have agreed to take
all reasonably necessary measures to continue in full force and
effect the stay of the implementation of Judge Kane's order. 
Currently, implementation of the order has been stayed until
December 19, 1994. 

Amdura Corporation, headquartered in Southbury, Connecticut,
operates primarily through The Crosby Group, Inc. and The Harris
Waste Management Group, Inc. Crosby, headquartered in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, designs and manufactures lifting equipment, hardware
and accessories for use in energy, construction, manufacturing,
marine and transportation applications. Harris, headquartered in
Peachtree City, Georgia, is engaged in manufacturing and<PAGE>

marketing equipment for plastic, paper and ferrous and non-
ferrous scrap metal processing, as well as waste recycling and
solid waste disposal.
