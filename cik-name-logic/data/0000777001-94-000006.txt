dividend declared today will be paid in respect of shares of common

dividend of 15 cents per share on the outstanding shares of common
stock, payable May 27, 1994 to shareholders of record on May 13,

per share on the outstanding shares of adjustable rate cumulative
preferred stock, payable July 15, 1994 to shareholders of record on
June 30, 1994. In addition, the Board declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $3.94 per share on the outstanding shares of 7.88%
cumulative preferred stock which is equivalent to 49 1/4 cents per
related depositary share, and a quarterly cash dividend of $3.80
per share on the outstanding shares of 7.60% cumulative preferred
stock which is equivalent to 47 1/2 cents per related depositary share,
both payable July 15, 1994 to shareholders of record on June 30,
1994.

Earlier in the week, the company reported net income for the
third fiscal quarter ended March 25, 1994 of $115.5 million, a 5%
increase from $110.4 million for the comparable quarter a year ago.

million, a 49% increase from $237.7 million a year ago. Giving

quarter were 88 cents per share, versus 88 cents for the same period a 
year ago. Earnings per share for the nine months ended March 25, 1994
were $2.65, a 40% increase from $1.89 for the comparable period
