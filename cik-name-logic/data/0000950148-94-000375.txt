THE FOOTHILL GROUP, INC. REPORTS
STRONG SECOND QUARTER RESULTS 

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, July 18, 1994 . . . The Foothill
Group, Inc. (NYSE-FGI) today reported net income for the second quarter ended
June 30, 1994 of $6,604,000, or 37 cents per fully diluted share, compared
with net income of $6,083,000, or 35 cents per fully diluted share, for the
quarter ended June 30, 1993. For the six months ended June 30, 1994, net
income increased 90% to $18,045,000, or $1.02 per fully diluted share,
compared with net income of $9,502,000, or 56 cents per fully diluted share,
for the same period in 1993.

Henry K. Jordan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, said, "Second quarter results reflect strong profitability due to
improved margins and significant growth in the asset-based loan portfolio of
Foothill Capital Corporation. Finance receivables reached $582,994,000 as of
June 30, 1994, up 27% on an annualized basis from $514,518,000 as of December
31, 1993. Foothill Capital Corporation continues to expand its national
market presence and recently opened a marketing office in Chicago to better
serve the midwest market. We anticipate continued portfolio growth for the
balance of 1994.

"The credit quality of the Company's asset-based loan
portfolio improved to a near record level as of June 30, 1994. Margins
expanded for both the three and six month periods ended June 30, 1994 due in
part to reductions in the Company's cost of funds. Volatility in the
interest rate environment has minimal impact on the Company's margins due to
its policy of matching interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Net
interest revenue,

as a percent of average assets, was 8.99% for the 1994 second quarter, 
compared with 8.64% for the second quarter ended June 30, 1993.

"Equity and purchased bank debt positions owned by the Company
have unrealized gains totaling $33,719,000 as of June 30, 1994. In addition,
investments of Foothill's managed partnerships show substantial unrealized
gains which, if realized, may contribute to future earnings.

"Book value per common share was $9.88 as of June 30, 1994, up
from $9.02 as of December 31, 1993. Total stockholders' equity increased in
the 1994 second quarter to a record $167 million."

The Foothill Group, Inc. is a specialized financial services
company which operates two tightly linked businesses: commercial lending and
money management. Foothill Capital Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary,
provides asset-based financing to businesses throughout the United States.
The parent company's money management operation conducts business through
institutional limited partnerships, seeking above average returns by
investing in debt instruments of companies in reorganization or in the
process of restructuring. As of June 30, 1994, Foothill had total assets
owned or under management of more than $1.2 billion.

operations. We will consider further dividend increases on a semiannual
basis."
