Florida Progress Corporation reports third-quarter earnings of $75.1 million

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (October 20, 1994) -- Florida Progress Corporation, parent
of St. Petersburg-based Florida Power Corporation, today reported third-quarter
earnings of $75.1 million, compared with $82 million earned during the same
period a year ago. 

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 1994, totaled $745 million,
compared with $768.9 million for the third quarter of 1993. Earnings per share
in the third quarter of 1994 were 80 cents, compared with 93 cents a share
earned during the same three-month period last year.

Florida Power, the largest subsidiary of Florida Progress, earned $69.4
million, or 74 cents per share, on revenues of $586.5 million in this year's
third quarter, compared with earnings of $81.5 million, or 92 cents a share, on
revenues of $609 million for the same period a year ago. 

Lower retail kilowatt-hour sales during this year's third quarter contributed
to the reduced earnings at Florida Power. Also reducing utility results were
two one-time charges against earnings - one for work force reduction costs and
another because of a decision to withdraw as an equity partner from a gas
pipeline project. 

During the third quarter, frequent afternoon thunderstorms lowered normally
high temperatures across Florida Power's 32-county service territory. This
reduced electricity demand and customer usage from July to September, compared
with a year ago, when Florida Power customers used record amounts of power. 
Six times last summer, the utility set system demand peaks.

In this year's third quarter, retail energy sales declined 3.7 percent,
compared with the same period in 1993. Florida Power's average residential
customer used 6.5 percent less electricity in the third quarter of 1994 than
during the same three-month period last year. Partly offsetting the decline in
third-quarter sales was customer growth of about 2 percent during the past
year.

Earlier this month, Florida Power announced that about 300 jobs would be
eliminated by the end of the year as part of its continuing efforts to reduce
costs. Expenses associated with these work force reductions resulted in an
after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings of $4.4 million. Later this
year, Florida Power will recognize a pension plan gain related to these work
force reductions, which will increase fourth-quarter earnings by approximately
$2.5 million. In addition, last month's decision to withdraw as an equity
partner from the proposed 715-mile SunShine gas pipeline project reduced
Florida Power's after-tax earnings in the third quarter by $3.9 million.

Earnings from Florida Progress' diversified operations for the quarter ended
September 30, 1994, were $5.7 million, or 6 cents per share, compared with
$500,000, or 1 cent a share, earned during last year's third quarter. 

Electric Fuels Corporation, the company's coal mining and transportation
subsidiary, posted higher operating results this year over the same three-month
period a year ago. Also, diversified results were higher this year than last
year because of the 1993 changes in the federal corporate income tax rate. The
higher tax rate and its related impact on accounting for long-term leveraged
leases lowered third-quarter earnings in 1993. 

Florida Progress (NYSE: FPC) is a diversified utility holding company with
assets of $5.7 billion. Its principal subsidiary is Florida Power Corporation,
the state's second-largest electric utility with more than 1.2 million
customers. Diversified operations include coal mining and transportation, life
insurance, real estate, and lending and leasing.

Florida Progress reports lower third-quarter 1994 earnings

Florida Progress, parent of St. Petersburg-based Florida Power Corporation,
today reported third-quarter earnings of $75.1 million, or 80 cents per
share, compared with $82 million, or 93 cents a share, earned during the
same period a year ago. Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 1994,
totaled $745 million, compared with $768.9 million for the third quarter of
1993. 

Third-quarter earnings were affected by:

-- Lower electricity sales at Florida Power.

-- A one-time charge that resulted from eliminating about
300 jobs.

-- Another one-time charge from withdrawing as an equity
partner in a gas pipeline project.

Florida Power, the largest subsidiary of Florida Progress, earned $69.4
million, or 74 cents per share, on revenues of $586.5 million in this
year's third quarter, compared with earnings of $81.5 million, or 92 cents
a share, on revenues of $609 million for the same period a year ago. 

Lower retail kilowatt-hour sales during this year's third quarter
contributed to the reduced earnings at Florida Power. Also reducing
utility results were two one-time charges against earnings -- one for work
force reduction costs and another because of a decision to withdraw as an
equity partner in a gas pipeline project. 

During the third quarter, frequent afternoon thunderstorms lowered normally
high temperatures across Florida Power's 32-county service territory. This
reduced electricity demand and customer usage from July to September,
compared with a year ago, when Florida Power customers used record amounts
of power. Six times last summer, the utility set system demand peaks.

In this year's third quarter, retail energy sales declined 3.7 percent,
compared with the same period in 1993. Florida Power's average residential
customer used

earnings

6.5 percent less electricity in the third quarter of 1994 than during the
same three-month period last year. Partly offsetting the decline in
third-quarter sales was customer growth of about 2 percent during the past
year.

Earlier this month, Florida Power announced that about 300 jobs would be
eliminated by the end of the year as part of its continuing efforts to
reduce costs. Expenses associated with these work force reductions
resulted in an after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings of $4.4
million, or 5 cents per share. Later this year, Florida Power will
recognize a pension plan gain related to these work force reductions, which
will increase fourth-quarter earnings by approximately $2.5 million. 

In addition, last month's decision to withdraw as an equity partner from
the proposed 715-mile SunShine gas pipeline project reduced Florida Power's
after-tax earnings in the third quarter by $3.9 million, or 4 cents a
share.

Earnings from Florida Progress' diversified operations for the quarter
ended September 30, 1994, were $5.7 million, or 6 cents per share, compared
with $500,000, or 1 cent a share, earned during last year's third quarter.

Electric Fuels Corporation, the company's coal mining and transportation
subsidiary, posted higher operating results during this year's third
quarter over the same three-month period in 1993. Diversified earnings
also were improved this year because, a year ago, Florida Progress
recognized a $1 million after-tax loss on the sale of four apartment
complexes. 

During last year's third quarter, a one-percent increase in the federal
corporate income tax rate went into effect, retroactive to January 1, 1993. 
The increase in the tax rate -- and its impact on accounting for long-term
leveraged leases -- lowered Florida Progress' consolidated earnings related
to the first six months of 1993 by $4.5 million. The retroactive tax rate
change reduced third-quarter 1993 diversified earnings by $3.4 million,
mostly related to a one-time deferred tax adjustment. At Florida Power,
the rate change added $1.1 million in tax expense in the third quarter
related to income earned during the first six months of 1993.

NINE-MONTH SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS

For the nine months ended September 30, 1994, consolidated earnings from
Florida Progress' operations were $163.8 million, or $1.79 per share, on
revenues of $2.056 billion, compared with earnings of $159.4 million, or
$1.81 a share, on revenues of $1.816 billion from a year ago. 

Florida Power's earnings for the first nine months of this year were $148.8
million, or $1.62 per share, on revenues of $1.587 billion. During the
same nine-month

Investor Information - Florida Progress reports lower third-quarter 1994
earnings

period in 1993, utility earnings were $152.1 million, or $1.73 a share, on
revenues of $1.478 billion.

Higher energy sales at Florida Power this year were offset by increased
costs for an early retirement program and work force reductions, as well as
a write-off related to the utility withdrawing as an equity partner from a
gas pipeline project. 

In early 1994, the utility recognized after-tax expenses of $9.5 million,
or 11 cents a share, to cover costs associated with its early retirement
program. Expenses associated with eliminating an additional 300 jobs by
the end of this year resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.4 million, or 5
cents a share, in this year's third quarter. 

Florida Power's decision to withdraw as an equity partner from the proposed
SunShine gas pipeline project reduced 1994 after-tax earnings by $3.9
million, or 4 cents a share. Additional depreciation expenses also lowered
Florida Power's 1994 earnings by $10.5 million.

Year-to-date earnings from Florida Progress' diversified operations were
$15 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with $6.5 million, or 7 cents
a share, for the first nine months of 1993. Electric Fuels has continued
to post a significant earnings increase in 1994 due to an acquisition it
made last year. Also, diversified earnings are up during the first nine
months of this year because, a year ago, the change in the federal
corporate income tax rate reduced nine-month results by $3.3 million.

Florida Progress (NYSE: FPC) is a diversified utility holding company with
assets of $5.7 billion. Its principal subsidiary is Florida Power
Corporation, the state's second-largest electric utility with more than 1.2
million customers. Diversified operations include coal mining and
transportation, life insurance, real estate, and lending and leasing.

Note: Total revenues include billed revenues and unbilled revenues that are 
accrued for accounting purposes. Statistics for total kilowatt-hour sales only

include billed kilowatt-hour sales. The statistic for system requirements is 
based on total system generation, so it includes billed and unbilled sales. 
Since system requirements include billed and unbilled kilowatt-hour sales, it 
is a better measure of total sales growth.
