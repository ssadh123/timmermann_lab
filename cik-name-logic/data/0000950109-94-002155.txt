AMSOUTH BANCORPORATION
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED STATEMENT OF CONDITION
SEPTEMBER 30, 1994
(Dollars In Thousands Except Share Amounts)

(A) Upon consummation of the merger with Tampa, each share of Tampa common 
stock will be converted into 1.5592 shares of AmSouth Common Stock. The
Tampa transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests;
therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase AmSouth
shareholders' equity by the total equity of Tampa. The unaudited pro forma
financial statements have been prepared assuming that AmSouth will issue in
the aggregate approximately 995,000 (1.5592 X 637,827) shares of AmSouth
Common Stock to the shareholders of Tampa. A reclassification from capital
surplus to common stock results from the issuance of the shares.

(B) The following pro forma adjustments are necessary to record the 
transactions for Community:

(1) To recapture a tax bad debt reserve as a 
result of the reversal of a special
deduction for bad debts allowed for certain 
savings and loan associations that is not 
available to commercial banks (441)

(2) To write off miscellaneous assets (56)

(3) To eliminate deferred loan fees-FASB 91 456

(4) To establish deferred taxes on applicable 
items above assuming a 38% tax rate (152)
------
$ (193)
======

(C) These amounts reflect purchase accounting adjustments of the book value of
the assets and liabilities of Community estimated at fair values. Current
market values of investment securities were determined using publicly
quoted prices. Certain long-term fixed rate loans and deposits were valued
based on prevailing market interest rates. The final purchase accounting
adjustments may vary to the extent that the market values of the assets and
liabilities change.

----------- 
$ 17,956
=========== 

</TABLE> 

The fair market values of the fixed assets and the Federal Home Loan Bank
advances are approximately equal to the book value; therefore, no fair
value adjustments are necessary.

Deferred taxes are established on the net difference between the fair value
adjustments and the deductible portion of the estimated acquisition costs.

(D) AmSouth is purchasing all of the outstanding shares of Community for a 
total cash purchase price of $17,069. There is no impact on AmSouth's
shareholders' equity, with all of the Community shareholders' equity being
eliminated and no new shares of AmSouth being issued.

The expected decrease for each of the twelve months ended December 31,
indicated below, on future net income and shareholders' equity of the
projected aggregate purchase accounting adjustments reflected in the
accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
assuming the merger was consummated on January 1, 1993 are as follows:

</TABLE> 

The Excess of Cost Over Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired is being amortized
on a straight line basis over twenty years. The accretion (amortization) of
all other items is generally over a shorter period and generally on an
accelerated method. Therefore, the expected decrease for each of the twelve
months ended December 31, 1994 - 1998 on future net income and shareholders'
equity increases each year.

The Excess of Cost Over Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired is being amortized

all other items is generally over a shorter period and generally on an

equity increases each year.

(G) On December 9, 1993, Mid-State Federal was merged into AmSouth Bank of
Florida, a wholly owned subsidiary of AmSouth, in a transaction accounted
for as a purchase under GAAP. Therefore, the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Statement of Condition at June 30, 1994, includes the balances
acquired from Mid-State Federal, as well as, the necessary purchase
accounting adjustments. Included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Statement of Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31,
1993, is the Mid-State Federal statement of earnings for the twelve months
ended September 30, 1993, the last available twelve month period (which is
