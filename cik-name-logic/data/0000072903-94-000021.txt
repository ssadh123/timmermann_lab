Item 5. Other Events

On July 18, 1994, Michigan Cogeneration Partners Limited Partnership (MCP),
a joint venture between subsidiaries of NRG Energy, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Northern States Power Company (NSP), and Cogentrix Energy, Inc.
reached an agreement with Consumers Power Company (Consumers), an electric
utility headquartered in Jackson, Michigan, to terminate the power sales
contract related to a 65 megawatt cogeneration facility being developed by MCP
in Parchment, Michigan. The MCP project would have provided electricity to
Consumers and steam to a James River Paper Company, Inc. facility. The
agreement to terminate the contract, among other terms, requires Consumers to
pay MCP $29,750,000. Since the contract was initiated in 1987, many factors
changed in Consumers' electric supply options, and other sources became more
attractive for its customers. NSP management expects the agreement will have
a positive financial impact in its 1994 financial results, but the final
impact will not be known until all costs associated with the contract
termination are identified.
