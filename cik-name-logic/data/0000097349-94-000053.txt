TEXACO ANNOUNCES SALE OF PRODUCING PROPERTIES
TO APACHE CORPORATION

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1994.
HOUSTON, Nov. 29 - Texaco and Apache Corporation have signed a 
memorandum of understanding outlining the terms under which Apache would 
purchase more than 300 scattered Texaco producing fields for approximately 
$600 million. The effective date of the sale is to be January 1, 1995, with 
an expected closing in the first quarter of 1995.
On July 5, Texaco announced several key action steps for worldwide 
enhanced growth, one of which was to dispose of underperforming U.S. 
properties which cumulatively contribute zero earnings and less than ten 
percent of Texaco's domestic upstream cash flow. The sale of these 
properties, and the redirection of proceeds from it, represents a significant 
milestone in implementing that plan. 
Commenting on the sale, Texaco Exploration and Production Inc. (TEPI) 
President, Clarence P. Cazalot, Jr., said, "Achieving greater shareholder 
value by focusing human resources and capital assets on our most profitable 
properties is a cornerstone of our plan for growth. The proceeds from this 
sale will be redeployed into growth opportunities across the company, 
including major expenditures on core producing properties in the U.S."
The properties included in the sale are located in the Permian Basin in
Texas, offshore Gulf of Mexico, onshore Louisiana, East and South Texas, 
Rocky Mountains, and the Midcontinent area of the U.S. The sale is subject 
to signing of the purchase and sale agreement, certain government approvals, 
as well as approval by both companies' Boards of Directors.
Not included in this sale are selective other producing properties 
largely in California and the Williston Basin in North Dakota, which Texaco 
also has offered for sale.
