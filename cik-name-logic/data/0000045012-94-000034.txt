HALLIBURTON AND ENSCO FORM EXCLUSIVE
COILED TUBING DRILLING ALLIANCE

DALLAS, Texas -- Halliburton Energy Services, a business segment of
Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL), and ENSCO Technology Company today
announced that they have signed an exclusive alliance agreement to jointly
provide directional and horizontal coiled tubing drilling service on a global
basis. The alliance seeks to maximize the respective strengths of each
company. ENSCO is well-known for its highly reliable and proven downhole
tools for drilling directional and horizontal wells with coiled tubing.
Halliburton is the world's largest provider of coiled tubing equipment and
and services with over 120 coiled tubing units worldwide.

Signed on September 19, the exclusive agreement provides for the two
companies to work jointly on all directional and horizontal coiled tubing
projects worldwide, both land and offshore. The alliance will not affect
current obligations of either party with customers or third parties.

"ENSCO has a very strong reputation for its patented bottom-hole orienting
tool and other technologies used in drilling wells with coiled tubing" said Ken
LeSuer, President and CEO of Halliburton Energy Services. "We believe that
this alliance will allow us to provide a great deal of value to our customers
worldwide who choose to use coiled tubing for certain directional and horizontal
drilling applications".

Using coiled tubing for drilling has significant economic and operational
benefits in certain situations. It has distinct advantages for re-entering
high pressure wells through casing and tubing production strings, is beneficial
in situations where location size or environmental concerns don't allow for
drilling with conventional rotary rigs, and can take less time to drill in some
cases. Also, because of smaller hole size, there is less drilling fluid
required and less cuttings for disposal. This is especially advantageous when
drilling underbalanced to minimize formation damage.

According to Stan Buffington, President of ENSCO Technology Company,
the alliance allows both Halliburton and ENSCO to take advantage of their
respective strengths in order to provide the highest-quality coiled tubing
drilling services to oil and gas operators around the world. "We are extremely
pleased to work with Halliburton in this mutually-beneficial relationship."

ENSCO Technology Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Service
Company, Inc. (ENSCO), is recognized as an industry leader in the supply of
directional and horizontal drilling services and related technology to the oil
and gas industry.
