(a) Financial Statement of Business Acquired.

See exhibits for historical financial statements of Novalta Resources Inc.

<PAGE> 3
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENT

On January 4, 1994, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Seagull Energy
Corporation ("Seagull" or the "Company") acquired all of the outstanding shares
of stock (the "Stock") of Novalta Resources Inc. ("Novalta") and an
intercompany note (the "Note") from Novalta to its parent, Novacor
Petrochemicals Ltd. ("Novacor Petrochemicals"). The Stock and the Note were
acquired for a purchase price of approximately $203 million in cash, subject to
customary post-closing adjustments (the "Seagull Canada Acquisition"). As of
February 1, 1994, the adjusted purchase price was estimated at $200.5 million.
The economic effective date of the Seagull Canada Acquisition was December 31,
1993 (the "Effective Date"). Effective as of the January 4, 1994 Closing Date,
Novalta was amalgamated with one of its subsidiaries along with Seagull Energy
Canada Ltd., the indirect subsidiary of Seagull that acquired Novalta. The
resulting amalgamated company was named Seagull Energy Canada Ltd. ("Seagull
Canada").

The unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 and 
the unaudited pro forma condensed statement of earnings for the year ended 
December 31, 1993 give effect to the Seagull Canada Acquisition, financed
initially under a new $175 million reducing revolving credit facility (the
"Canadian Credit Agreement") as well as borrowings under Seagull's amended
and restated $475 millon revolving credit line (the "Revolver") with a group of
major U.S. and international banks.

The following unaudited pro forma information has been included as required by
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is provided for
comparative purposes only. The unaudited pro forma information presented is
based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Seagull
and Novalta and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements
and the related notes thereto. The historical consolidated financial statements
of Novalta as presented do not reflect the effect of certain transactions
between Novalta and NOVA Corporation of Alberta and its subsidiaries that were 
completed prior to the closing of the Seagull Canada Acquisition, such as the 
elimination of intercompany debt balances. The effect of such transactions are 
reflected in the conforming adjustments to the pro forma unaudited condensed 
financial statements. The unaudited pro forma information presented does not 
purport to be indicative of actual results, if the combinations had been in 
effect on the dates or for the periods indicated, or of future results.

All amounts are in U.S. dollars.

AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Directors of
Novalta Resources Inc.

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Novalta Resources Inc. as at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the consolidated statements of income, deficit
and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31,
1993 and 1992 and the results of its operations and the changes in its
financial position for the years then ended in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in Canada.

NOVALTA RESOURCES INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Novalta Resources
Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries. Substantially all of the exploration
and production activities of the Company are conducted jointly with others, and
accordingly, these financial statements reflect only the Company's
proportionate interest in such activities.

All amounts are reported in Canadian dollars.

FIXED ASSETS

Under the successful efforts method of accounting, costs of land acquisition,
costs to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and costs
to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. All other exploration
costs, including costs to drill unsuccessful exploratory wells, geological and
geophysical costs, and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties
are expensed as incurred. Acquisition costs of unproved properties are
amortized over the remaining term of the lease or until reserves are proved or
the property is impaired and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment.
Proved properties are carried at the lesser of cost or an ultimate recoverable
amount.

Capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are amortized by the
unit-of-production method based on reserve estimates prepared by an independent
consultant using end of the year prices.

Other fixed assets are being depreciated using the declining balance method at
annual rates varying from 10% to 50%, which are designed to amortize the costs
of the assets over their estimated useful lives.

Future removal and site restoration costs for petroleum and natural gas
properties are provided on the unit-of-production method.

INVESTMENTS

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

COMPARATIVE FIGURES

Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the
financial statement presentation adopted for the current year.

Revolving term credit facility $ - $ 5,500
======= ======= 
</TABLE>

As at December 31, the Company had a Revolving Term Credit Facility (the
facility) with a borrowing base of $75,000,000, subject to annual review. The
principal features of this facility were:

Maturity - December 31, 2000, with the amount available under
the facility being reduced quarterly by $2,750,000 
- current repayments were required to the extent
principal amounts outstanding exceed the borrowing
base

Collateral - assignment of proceeds from certain long term
natural gas sales contracts 
- $150,000,000 floating charge debenture 
- assignment of book debts 
- assignment of present and future petroleum and
natural gas properties

Interest - varying rates over the term based on the method of
financing chosen which at December 31, 1992 were
Canadian Dollar Loans at an effective rate of 7.63%

The Revolving Term Credit Facility, at the Company's request, was terminated on
September 16, 1993.

At December 31, 1992, the Company had two interest rate swap agreements
outstanding which had effectively fixed the interest rates on $40,000,000 of
available borrowing at 11.01% and 11.10% for the years 1993 and 1994
respectively. The agreements were terminated during 1993.

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NOVA Corporation of
Alberta ("NOVA"). During 1993, NOVA transferred ownership of the Company to
Novacor Petrochemicals Ltd. ("NPL"). All intercompany amounts disclosed in the
consolidated financial statements relate to companies wholly-owned or
affiliated with NOVA.

12. RECONCILIATION TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY
ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada ("Canadian
basis") which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("US basis") in most areas. The following reconciliations reflect the
differences in these accounting principles, where applicable.

SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" requires the use of the liability
method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Effective January 1, 1992,
the Company adopted the provisions of FAS 109 for US basis accounting purposes.
The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle is included in the
Company's consolidated net loss for US reporting purposes for the year ended
December 31, 1992.

Novalta Resources Inc.

The Company's standardized measure of future net cash flows and changes therein
as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 are provided on the present value of future
net revenues from proved gas and oil reserves estimated by independent
petroleum engineers in accordance with the guidelines
established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These estimates were
computed by applying appropriate current prices for gas and oil to estimated
future production of proved gas and oil reserves over the economic lives of the
reserves assuming continuation of existing conditions. Year end 1993
calculations were made utilizing average prices for gas and oil, condensate and
natural gas liquids that existed at December 31, 1993 of $2.12 per Mcf and
$12.57 per barrel , respectively. Income taxes are computed by applying the
statutory federal and provincial tax rates to the net cash inflows relating to
proved gas and oil reserves less the tax bases of the properties involved and
giving effect to any tax credits and allowances relating to such properties.
The reserve volumes provided by the independent petroleum engineers are
estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities. These may
or may not be recovered and may increase or decrease as a result of future
operations of the Company and changes in market conditions.
