UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

Bankers Trust New York Corporation, 
280 Park Avenue,
New York, New York 10017.

Dear Sirs:

We, as Underwriters (the "Underwriters"), understand that
Bankers Trust New York Corporation, a New York corporation (the
"Corporation"), proposes to issue and sell 80,000 shares of its Adjustable
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Q ($2,500 Liquidation Preference)
(the "Offered Shares") to us, to be deposited against delivery of
depositary receipts (the "Depositary Receipts"), evidencing depositary
shares (the "Depositary Shares", and with the Offered Shares, the
"Securities"), to be issued by Harris Trust Company of New York, as
depositary (the "Depositary") pursuant to a deposit agreement, dated as of
March 28, 1994, among the Corporation, the Depositary and the holders from
time to time of the Depositary Receipts. The terms of the Securities are
set forth in the Registration Statement and Basic Prospectus referred to in
the provisions incorporated herein by reference, as supplemented by a
Prospectus Supplement dated March 21, 1994.

All the provisions contained in the document entitled Bankers
Trust New York Corporation Series Preferred Stock Underwriting Agreement
Standard Provisions (September 1993), a copy of which you have previously
received, are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety and shall
be deemed to be a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if such
provisions had been set forth in full herein; provided, however, that such
provisions shall be supplemented and, to the extent inconsistent with the
following provision, superseded, by the following provision:

(i) This Agreement shall be subject to termination in
the Underwriter's absolute discretion, by notice given to the
Corporation prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities if,
prior to such time, any of the following events occurs: (a) trading
in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or on any
other stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the
Securities are or are to be listed or to which the Securities shall
have been or are to be admitted for quotation, shall have been
suspended or materially limited, (b) trading in securities of the
Corporation specifically on the New York Stock Exchange or the
American Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially
limited and such suspension or material limitation is in effect or
exists on the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

Closing Date, or (c) a general moratorium on commercial banking
activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or
New York State authorities or (d) there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or
the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war
the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is
such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters,
impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner
described in the Prospectus.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein or
incorporated by reference herein, the Corporation hereby agrees to sell and
we hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase the number of
Depositary Shares set forth opposite our respective names in Schedule I
hereto at a purchase price of $24.2125 per Depositary Share, plus accrued
dividends, if any, from March 28, 1994; provided, however, that in the case
of Depositary Shares sold to certain institutional investors, the purchase
price shall be $24.50 per Depositary Share, plus accrued dividends, if any,
from March 28, 1994 to the date of payment and delivery.

We will pay for such Securities upon delivery thereof at the
offices of the Corporation, 130 Liberty Street, New York, New York, at
10:00 A.M. (New York City time), on March 28, 1994 or at such other time,
not later than April 4, 1994, as shall be designated by us, such time being
referred to herein as the "Closing Date". 

The certificate representing the Offered Shares will be
delivered by us to, and deposited with, the Depositary against delivery of
Depositary Receipts representing Depositary Shares. Such Depositary
Receipts shall be issued in such denominations and registered in such names
as we shall request and shall be made available for checking and packaging
at the above office of the Corporation at least 24 hours prior to the
Closing Date.

Please confirm your agreement by having an authorized officer
sign a copy of this Agreement in the
