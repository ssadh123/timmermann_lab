ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

On July 21, 1994, A.L. Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company") issued two press
releases announcing that it had acquired Wade Jones Company, Inc., a Texas
corporation ("Wade Jones"), a distributor of poultry animal health products that
is also actively involved in the development, manufacture and sale of its own
line of products including animal health pharmaceuticals and feed additives.
The Company consummated the acquisition of Wade Jones by acquiring all of the
outstanding capital stock of Mikjan Corporation, an Arkansas corporation
("Mikjan"), which is the parent of Wade Jones. The Mikjan capital stock was
acquired from Mick Wagner, Jan Powell and certain charitable trusts established
by Mr. Wagner and Mr. Powell. Prior to the acquisition, Wade Jones acted as a
distributor of the Company's poultry animal health products. The Company
intends to continue to operate Wade Jones as a stand-alone business maintaining
its historic operations while expanding the scope of such operations.

The Company paid aggregate consideration of $8,219,440 as the initial
purchase price for the Mikjan capital stock, subject to a potential purchase
price adjustment for which certain amounts were retained by the Company. The
Company will pay additional consideration specified in the Stock Purchase
Agreement (defined below) in the event that regulatory approval is obtained
permitting the marketing of certain development stage products and in the event
that such products are successfully marketed by Wade Jones. The Company
obtained funds for the acquisition from a lender through a line of credit. The
identity of such lender has been filed separately with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Mikjan Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mikjan
Corporation and subsidiary (the "Company") as of October 2, 1993 and October 3,
1992, the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings
(accumulated deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Mikjan Corporation and subsidiary as of October 2, 1993 and October 3, 1992 and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

MIKJAN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include
the consolidated accounts of Mikjan Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Wade Jones Company, Inc. (the "Company"). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

NATURE OF BUSINESS - The Company is a manufacturer and distributor of
various feed additives, poultry medication and antibiotics for animals. The
Company extends credit to customers throughout the United States who serve
the poultry industry.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK - Assets which potentially subject the Company
to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable
and cash in financial institutions in excess of the federal deposit
insurance limits of $340,000 at October 2, 1993 and $377,000 at October 3,
1992. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers.

FISCAL YEAR - The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to
September 30.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates market
value. At October 2, 1993 and October 3, 1992, cash equivalents included
repurchase agreements of $440,000 and $477,000, respectively.

INVENTORY - Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, using the weighted
average cost method, or market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the
estimated useful lives of the improvements. Annual depreciation is
primarily computed using the straight-line method. As assets are disposed
of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, Continued

INCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes, reflecting timing differences in
recognizing income and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes,
relate principally to depreciation, deferred compensation and accrued
liabilities.

AMORTIZATION - A covenant not to compete was being amortized over five years
and became fully amortized in 1993. A licensing agreement and the excess of
purchase price over the net assets at the acquisition date of Wade Jones
Company of Texas, Inc., is being amortized over a period of forty years.
Amortization is computed using the straight-line method.

10. FUTURE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS No. 109"): "Accounting for
Income Taxes" which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December

recognized for any difference between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts measured by using
presently enacted tax laws and rates. The Company has not yet determined
the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 109.

Combined Financial Statements
(In thousands of dollars)

1. Basis of Presentation
---------------------

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements (pro forma
financials) are presented for illustrative purposes only, giving effect to the
acquisition, as described and therefore are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results and financial position that might have been achieved had the
combination occurred as of an earlier date, nor are they necessarily indicative
of operating results and financial position which may occur in the future.

On July 21, 1994, the Company acquired the stock of the Mikjan Corporation
(hereinafter referred to as "Wade Jones Company" or "Wade Jones".) The Wade
Jones Company is a major distributor of Poultry Animal Health products with
headquarters in Lowell, Arkansas and five other facilities. In addition, Wade
Jones manufactures and blends certain Animal Health products. The purchase
agreement required a purchase price of approximately $8,200 and provides for
contingent payments based on certain product approvals.

The acquisition will be accounted for in accordance with the purchase method.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
reflect the acquisition as if it occurred as of the beginning of the periods
presented for the income statements and as of June 30, 1994 for the balance
sheet presented. The Wade Jones Company presently has a fiscal year which ends
on the Saturday closest to September 30. Accordingly, the pro forma financials
consolidate the results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 1993
with the Company's year ended December 31, 1993 and the results of operations
for the period October 3, 1993 to March 31, 1994 with the Company's six month
results of operations as of June 30, 1994.

For the pro forma balance sheet the unaudited Wade Jones balance sheet dated
June 30, 1994 has been consolidated with the balance sheet of the Company dated
June 30, 1994.

The actual results of Wade Jones will be consolidated with the Company from
the date of acquisition.

The pro forma balance sheet includes a preliminary allocation of the purchase
price which will be adjusted during the allocation period based on a detail
review of the assets and liabilities acquired.

Transactions between the Company and Wade Jones Company
- - -------------------------------------------------------

during prior years including Wade Jones distributing the Company's primary
Animal Health products to the poultry industry and blending certain of the
Company's products.

market interest rates.

In preparing the pro forma financials these transactions are designated
intercompany and eliminated.

------------------------- -------------- 
be equal to the excess of the consolidated assets of the Companies over the
consolidated liabilities of the Companies calculated in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the Current Balance Sheet at such time.

(b) Net Book Value Adjustment Definition. The "Net Book Value Adjustment"

shall be equal to the amount, if any, by which the Net Book Value, as reflected
on the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Closing Date Net Book Value") is less than or
---------------------------

------------------------------------------------------- 
purpose of determining the Net Book Value Adjustment, within sixty days after

accordance with GAAP, will cause Coopers and Lybrand to audit and will deliver
to the Sellers, the consolidated balance sheet as of July 22, 1994 (the "Closing
-------

parties. The fees and expenses of the Selected Accounting Firm shall be split
equally between the Purchaser and Sellers. In the event that the Net Book Value
Adjustment is negative (reflecting a decrease in the Net Book Value) Sellers

the event that the Net Book Value Adjustment is positive (reflecting an increase
in Net Book Value) the Purchaser shall pay such amount (together with the
Holdback amount) to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.2(b) above. In the
event that there is no Net

provided that, nothing in the foregoing shall preclude an Indemnified Party from

Indemnified Party has additional or separate defenses, or there is otherwise a
conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and any Indemnifying Party,
then, in any such case, the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's Counsel
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not
elect to assume and control the defense of the Third Party claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel
employed by such Indemnified Party in such action and to participate in the
defense thereof. The fees and

- 27 -
<PAGE>

expenses of such counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party.

not in derogation of, any statutory or common law remedy any party may have for
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant.

7.4 SPECIAL INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to the provisions of Section
7.2 and 7.3 above, Wagner and Powell jointly and severally agree to indemnify

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

A. L. LABORATORIES ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF

WADE JONES COMPANY, INC.

FORT LEE, N.J., July 21, 1994 -- A. L. Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BMD)
today announced that it has acquired the Wade Jones Company, Inc. ("Wade
Jones"), headquartered in Lowell, Arkansas. Terms of the transaction were not
disclosed.

Wade Jones is the major poultry animal health products distributor in the
United States, and is also actively involved in the development, manufacture and
sale of its own line of products including animal health pharmaceuticals and
feed additives. Approximately two-thirds of all products sold by A. L.
Laboratories to the poultry industry are distributed by Wade Jones.

The Company estimates that the acquisition will add at least $20 million
of revenue to A. L. Laboratories on an annualized basis, with approximately half
of that amount being derived from Wade Jones' animal health products which are
complementary to the Company's current poultry products line.

Commenting on the announcement, Einar W. Sissener, Chief Executive
Officer of A. L. Laboratories, Inc. said, "A large per-centage of our Animal
Health business is directed to the poultry industry. This strategic
acquisition significantly strengthens 

- M O R E -
<PAGE>

our position in, and our ability to serve that industry. In addition to
integrating forward toward the customer, which is particularly important to our
growth strategy, this acquisition also provides a number of interesting
complementary products, and will allow us greater flexibility in the types of
products we can offer our customers.

"While the full benefit of this acquisition will not be felt until 1995
and beyond, based on Wade Jones' historical performance and the terms of the
transaction, this acquisition will not be dilutive to the Company's earnings in
1994."

David E. Cohen, President of A. L. Laboratories' Animal Health Division
added, "Wade Jones has been an important element of our success and consistent
growth in the poultry market, and we are excited to have their capabilities now
directly available to us. Wade Jones brings a focused, energetic team, a
seasoned sales force and an efficient production and distribution operation.

Additionally, our present line of water-soluble pharmaceu-tical products
will be strengthened by Wade Jones' complementary FDA-approved medications, and
their new product pipeline should provide other profitable products in the
future," Mr. Cohen concluded.

A. L. Laboratories is an international pharmaceutical company developing,
manufacturing and marketing specialty generic and pro-prietary human
pharmaceuticals and animal health products with plant sites in Illinois,
Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Washington State, Denmark and
Indonesia.
