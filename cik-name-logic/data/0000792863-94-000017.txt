The information called for by this Item is included on Pages

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.

The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet data at March

stations WPGC-AM/FM, (collectively, the "Stations"). The unaudited pro forma
combined statements of operations data for the year ended December 31, 1993
and the three months ended March 31, 1994 are presented as if, at the
beginning of such periods, the Company had acquired the Stations and radio

In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary
to present fairly this pro forma information have been made.

The pro forma combined financial statements that follow should
be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes thereto, which appear in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1993 and in the Company's Quarterly

the Financial statements and Notes thereto of the Stations and KRTH-FM

specified, nor is it indicative of the Company's future results.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Infinity Broadcasting Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets of WPGC FM & AM
(stations owned and operated by Cook Inlet Radio Partners, L.P. and Cook
Inlet Radio License Partners, L.P.) pursuant to the asset purchase agreement
referred to in note 2 to the financial statements as of December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related statements of operating revenues and expenses for
the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of
WPGC FM & AM's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the net assets of WPGC FM & AM (pursuant to the
asset purchase agreement referred to in note 2 to the financial statements)
as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and its operating revenues and expenses for
the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

WPGC FM & AM
(Stations owned and operated by Cook Inlet Radio Partners,
L.P. and Cook Inlet Radio License Partners, L.P.)

Notes to Financial Statements

December 31, 1993 and 1992

(1) Disposition of Radio Stations WPGC FM & AM

Effective June 17, 1994, Cook Inlet Radio Partners,
L.P., and Cook Inlet Radio License Partners, L.P., (collectively
referred to as the Partnership) sold certain assets and
liabilities of WPGC FM & AM (stations owned and operated by the
Partnership), as defined in the asset purchase agreement, to
Infinity Broadcasting Corporation of Maryland and Infinity
Broadcasting Corporation (collectively referred to as Infinity)
for $60 million.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

The accompanying statements of net assets include the
net assets of radio stations WPGC FM & AM (the Station) as
contemplated by the aforementioned asset purchase agreement.
These financial statements exclude the Station's assets and
liabilities which are not subject to the asset purchase
agreement, principally cash, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities. The accompanying statements of
operating revenues and expenses reflect the results of operations
for the Station before interest expense, income taxes and other
non-operating expenses, including Corporate expense allocations.
These statements are presented on the basis of the Station's
historical cost, based primarily on allocations of the purchase
price paid for all of the radio stations owned and operated by
the Partnership. Goodwill, arising from a multiple station
acquisition in 1988 which included the Station, has been
allocated to the Station based upon independent appraisals for
each station obtained by the Partnership at time of acquisition.
The accompanying statements of net assets and operating revenues
and expenses are not intended to be a complete presentation of WPGC
FM & AM's assets and liabilities and results of operations. The
accompanying statements of operating revenues and expenses are
not necessarily representative of future operations under the
ownership of Infinity.

The Partnership is headquartered in Greenbelt,
Maryland (Corporate) and owns and operates radio stations in
various markets. The Partnership accounts for each station's
revenues and specifically identifiable costs on a specific
station basis. Interest on outstanding debt is expensed on the
records of Corporate and is not allocated to the stations, and no
interest is charged to the stations for their respective capital
balances. Corporate Charges such as financing and acquisition
costs, management and consulting fees payable to the
Partnership's general partners, deferred compensation related to
certain corporate management, and other charges not directly
related to individual stations, are not allocated to the Station.

Notes to Financial Statements

(b) Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization is provided on the straight-line-
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Transmitters and towers 5-15 years
Equipment and furniture 3-10 years

(c) Intangible Assets

Intangible assets with determinable lives, such as
favorable operating lease, on-air talent contracts, and other
contracts and agreements are recorded at their appraised value on
the acquisition date of the Station. Goodwill includes both
intangible assets with indeterminable lives and the excess of
cost over the fair market value of tangible assets and intangible
assets with determinable lives. Amortization is provided by use
of the straight-line method over the following lives:

Goodwill 40 years
Other intangible assets Term of the contract
or lease
(d) Income Taxes

Federal and state income tax regulations provide that
partnership income or losses be reported by the individual
partners on their respective income tax returns. Accordingly, no
provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying
financial statements.

(3) Nonmonetary Transactions

The Station has entered into nonmonetary transactions
with advertisers, whereby the Station agrees to provide
commercial air time in exchange for goods or services. These
transactions are recorded as the advertising is broadcast, or
when the goods and services are received.

(4) Commitments

(a) Employment Contracts

The Partnership has assumed and entered into contracts
for employment services. Payments to be made under these
contracts related to the Station at December 31, 1993, are as
