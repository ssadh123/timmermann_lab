FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

MELLON REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY NET INCOME IN SECOND QUARTER 1994

o Earnings Per Share Increases 36 Percent and Net Income 
Increases 35 Percent

o Return on Equity is 17.04 Percent; Return on Assets Reaches 
1.47 Percent for Quarter

o Fee Revenue Increases 20 Percent, Comprises Nearly 50 Percent
of Total Revenue for Quarter

PITTSBURGH, July 19, 1994 -- Mellon Bank Corporation today reported 
second quarter 1994 net income of $134 million, or $1.80 per common 
share, compared with net income of $99 million, or $1.32 per common 
share, in the second quarter of 1993. Net income was at the highest 
quarterly level in the Corporation's history, excluding those quarters 
affected by certain nonrecurring gains. Annualized return on common 
shareholders' equity and return on assets were 17.04 percent and 1.47 
percent, respectively, in the second quarter of 1994.

"Mellon continues to generate strong and consistent earnings, and we 
look forward to completing our merger with The Dreyfus Corporation in 
the third quarter," said Mellon Chairman, President and Chief Executive 
Officer Frank V. Cahouet.

Net interest revenue for the quarter was $357 million, up 14 percent 
from $314 million in the prior-year period. Fee revenue was $336 
million, up 20 percent from $281 million in the second quarter of 
1993. The increase in net interest revenue was attributable primarily 
to the Corporation's 1993 acquisitions of The Boston Company and AFCO 
Credit Corporation; the increase in fee revenue was attributable 
principally to The Boston Company acquisition.

Operating expense for the second quarter of 1994 was $456 million, 
compared with $391 million in the second quarter of 1993. The increase 
resulted primarily from the effect of The Boston Company acquisition 
and expenses associated with the Corporation's CornerStone(sm) credit 
card product.

The provision for credit losses was $20 million in the second quarter 
of 1994, compared with $35 million in the prior-year period. Net 
credit losses were $14 million, down significantly from $40 million in 
the second quarter of 1993.

Nonperforming assets totaled $264 million at June 30, 1994, down
$50 million, or 16 percent, from $314 million at March 31, 1994. 
Nonperforming assets decreased by $214 million, or 45 percent, compared 
with June 30, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
- - ------------------------

Pending Dreyfus Corporation Merger
- - ----------------------------------

In December 1993, the Corporation entered into a definitive agreement to merge
with The Dreyfus Corporation (Dreyfus). Dreyfus is the nation's sixth-largest
mutual fund company, with approximately $71 billion of assets under management
and administration at June 30, 1994. The merger of the Corporation and Dreyfus
is expected to create a diversified financial services organization with annual
revenues of approximately $3.2 billion, including fee revenue of approximately
$1.7 billion. Dreyfus is headquartered in New York City and employs
approximately 2,100.

Dreyfus shareholders will receive .88017 shares of the Corporation's common
stock for each share of Dreyfus common stock outstanding. Dreyfus has
approximately 37 million shares outstanding. The transaction will be accounted
for under the pooling-of-interests method, with prior period financial results
restated to reflect the merger. The Corporation's capital ratios following the
merger are expected to be approximately 200 basis points higher than the June
30, 1994 ratios. However, as a result of the approximately 33 million
additional shares of the Corporation's common stock to be issued to the Dreyfus
shareholders, the Corporation's book value per common share is expected to be
approximately 13% lower than previously reported amounts. Earnings per common
share are also expected to be approximately 19% lower than previously reported
amounts.

In connection with the transaction, the Corporation expects to record one-time
after-tax merger expenses of approximately $85 million at closing, which is
anticipated to occur during the third quarter of 1994.
<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
July 19, 1994
Page 5

The Corporation has received notification that its proposed merger with Dreyfus
has received the approval of all required regulatory agencies. Completion of
the merger is contingent upon the approval of the shareholders of the
Corporation and Dreyfus and certain approvals by the boards of directors and
shareholders of the mutual funds managed, advised or administered by Dreyfus.

</TABLE>

The 14% improvement in net interest revenue in the second quarter of 1994,
compared with the second quarter of 1993, primarily reflected a $1.5 billion
higher level of average interest-earning assets resulting from the May 1993
acquisition of The Boston Company and the December 1993 acquisition of AFCO
Credit Corporation (AFCO). In addition, these acquisitions enabled the
Corporation to replace lower-margin money market assets with higher-margin loans
and securities. Average loans increased $3.6 billion and average securities
increased $650 million, partially offset by a decrease of $2.8 billion in money
market assets. Average credit card loans increased approximately $200 million,
or 17%, in the second quarter of 1994, compared with the prior-year period,
primarily driven by the CornerStone credit card product introduced during the
first quarter. At June 30, 1994, this product had generated 495,000 new
accounts with total outstandings of approximately $215 million. A further
reduction in nonperforming assets also contributed to the improved net interest
revenue and net interest margin compared with the prior-year period.

The improvement in net interest revenue in the first six months of 1994
principally resulted from the same factors responsible for the second quarter
increase.

(a) Excludes net credit losses on segregated assets.

Credit quality expense, defined as the provision for credit losses plus the net
expense of acquired property, was $31 million lower in the second quarter of
1994, compared with the prior-year period, reflecting continuing improvement in
the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the lower level of real estate
acquired (OREO). The $3 million in net revenue from acquired property in the
second quarter of 1994 resulted from $3 million in net gains on the sale of
acquired property. Net expense of acquired property of $13 million in the
second quarter of 1993 included $9 million of provision to the reserve for OREO.
No provision to the reserve for OREO was recorded in the second quarter of 1994.
Net credit losses decreased $26 million compared with the second quarter of 1993
primarily resulting from lower commercial real estate net credit losses.

Credit quality expense was $29 million for the first six months of 1994,
compared with $108 million in the first half of 1993. Improved credit
<PAGE>

quality led to a $30 million decrease in the provision for credit losses in the
first half of 1994, compared with the prior-year period. The net expense of
acquired property decreased $49 million in the first half of 1994, compared with
the prior year period. No provision to the reserve for OREO was recorded in the
first half of 1994, compared to $30 million in the first half of 1993. Net
credit losses in the first six months of 1994 were down by $58 million compared
with the first half of 1993, primarily resulting from lower commercial real
estate net credit losses.

</TABLE>

Fee revenue increased by $55 million, or 20%, in the second quarter of 1994,
compared with the second quarter of 1993, primarily reflecting an increase of
$67 million of fee revenue attributable to The Boston Company acquisition
completed in May 1993. Partially offsetting this increase was an approximately
$25 million reduction in fee revenue resulting from the divestiture of three fee
based businesses.

The $59 million improvement in trust and investment management fees in the
second quarter of 1994 resulted principally from $55 million of these fees
earned at The Boston Company. Partially offsetting this increase was the
<PAGE>

Page 8

May 6, 1994, completion of the sale of part of the Corporation's Boston based
third-party mutual fund administration business. As a result of the sale of
this business, trust and investment management fee revenue was reduced by
approximately $4 million in the second quarter of 1994 and will be reduced by
approximately $7 million per quarter in the future.

Information services fees decreased $22 million compared with the prior-year
period, primarily as a result of the Corporation's December 1993 sale of two
information services businesses. The two businesses sold generated quarterly
revenues of approximately $21 million.

The increase in mortgage servicing fees, compared with the prior-year period,
resulted principally from higher levels of mortgage servicing rights acquired in
the first half of 1994 and the second half of 1993. The increase in credit card
revenue in the second quarter of 1994, compared with the second quarter of 1993,
primarily resulted from revenue generated by the Corporation's CornerStone
credit card product.

The increase in foreign currency and securities trading fee revenue in the
second quarter of 1994 was attributable to foreign exchange fees earned,
primarily from global custody customers at The Boston Company. Other fee
revenue included $20 million from the Corporation's seasonal tax refund
anticipation loan program. Fee revenue generated by this seasonal product
increased $2 million compared with the prior-year period. No significant
revenue is expected in the second half of 1994 from this product.

Fee revenue in the first six months of 1994 was up $166 million, or 32%, from
the first six months of 1993, primarily as a result of the same factors
responsible for the second quarter increase.

The Corporation recorded $87 million in gains on the sale of securities during
the first six months of 1993, resulting from the sale of securities in the
available for sale portfolio. These sales were undertaken as part of the
financing plan and balance sheet restructuring related to the acquisition of The
Boston Company.

Operating expense before the net expense of acquired property and merger
expenses increased by $81 million, or 21%, in the second quarter of 1994,
compared with the second quarter of 1993. The increase was primarily the result
of an increase of $58 million attributable to The Boston Company, acquired in
May 1993, and an increase in marketing expense of $7 million, primarily related
to the Corporation's CornerStone credit card product. The increase in expenses
attributable to AFCO were approximately offset by the decrease in expenses
related to the information services businesses
<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
July 19, 1994
Page 10

sold in December 1993. Also impacting second quarter 1994 operating expense
were increases in various categories in support of revenue growth.

Operating expense before the net expense of acquired property and merger
expenses totaled $938 million in the first six months of 1994, compared with
$711 million in the first half of 1993. The increase was primarily the result
of the same factors responsible for the second quarter increase, including the
increased marketing expense of $27 million, recorded in the first six months,
primarily related to the introduction of the Corporation's CornerStone credit
card product.

The Corporation has historically accounted for mergers under the purchase method
of accounting, resulting in the recording of goodwill and other identified
intangibles which are subsequently amortized in future years into operating
expense. These intangibles primarily include goodwill from The Boston Company
and Meritor acquisitions as well as core deposit intangibles and covenants not
to compete. Net income, excluding the after tax impact of the amortization
expense of intangibles recorded in purchase acquisitions of $19 million and $40
million for the second quarter and first half of 1994, would have been $153
million and $305 million, respectively.

The increase in average full-time equivalent staff level, compared with the
prior-year period, primarily reflected the addition of the employees of The
Boston Company.

Merger expenses of $175 million pretax, or $112 million after-tax, were recorded
in the first quarter of 1993 to reflect management's estimate of expenses
associated with the merger of The Boston Company.

Income Taxes
- - ------------

The provision for income taxes totaled $166 million in the first six months of
1994, for an effective tax rate of approximately 38.5%, compared with $104
million in the first six months of 1993. Excluding the impact of the merger
expenses and securities gains, the Corporation's effective tax rate for the
first half of 1993 was 41%. The decrease in the effective rate between periods
is primarily the result of tax legislation, enacted in August 1993, which
permitted the tax deductibility of certain intangible amortization expense.
After completion of the merger with The Dreyfus Corporation, it is currently
anticipated that the effective tax rate will increase to approximately 39%.

estate assets, which include nonperforming commercial and consumer
<PAGE>

real estate loans and OREO net of the reserve, decreased by $37 million during
the quarter primarily as a result of returns to accrual status, asset sales and
repayments. The decrease in other domestic nonperforming loans primarily
resulted from repayments offset, in part, by additions. The decrease in
international nonperforming loans resulted from the sale of loans made to a real
estate developer.

Nonperforming assets decreased by $214 million, or 45%, compared with June 30,
1993, primarily due to the $178 million reduction in domestic nonperforming real
estate assets. The reduction resulted primarily from asset sales, returns to
accrual status and repayments. Other domestic nonperforming loans decreased by
$26 million primarily due to repayments and credit losses. The $8 million
decrease in other assets acquired resulted from asset sales.

(c) The book value per common share assumes full conversion of the Series D
preferred stock to common stock. Accordingly, this includes the additional
paid-in capital on the Series D preferred stock because this paid-in
capital has no liquidation preference over the common stock.

The increase in the Corporation's common and total shareholders' equity in the
second quarter of 1994, compared with March 31, 1994, was the result of earnings
retention.

Note: In accordance with the January 1, 1994 adoption of FAS No. 115, certain
assets available for sale are reported at fair value at June 30, 1994
with the unrealized loss of $32 million, net of taxes, included in
common shareholders' equity. No reclassifications of assets were made
to adopt this new accounting standard. The impact of recording the
unrealized loss resulted in a reduction of book value per common share
at June 30, 1994 of $.49 cents.
