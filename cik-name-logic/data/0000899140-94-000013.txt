Cash Collateral Account. The Cash Collateral Account and the Cash Collateral
shall be subject to the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent
and, except as set forth above, the Cash Collateral shall be retained in the
Cash Collateral Account until the repayment of Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate
Loans, as the case may be, in an amount equal to the amount of the Cash
Collateral deposited therein. Upon any such repayment, an amount equal to the
amount of such repayment shall be transferred from the Cash Collateral Account
to the Company. The Administrative Agent shall invest the Cash Collateral in
Cash Equivalents, and shall pay over to the Company any interest earned on
such investments quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and
December; provided, that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred 
and be continuing (in which case such interest shall be retained as Cash
Collateral). The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any losses or
decreases in value with respect to the Cash Collateral, other than those
occurring as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

2.7 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Company may
elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans to Base
Rate Loans, and/or to convert Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans to C/D Rate
Loans, by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election; provided, that any such conversion of
Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans may only be made on the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. The Company may elect from time to time
to convert Base Rate Loans or C/D Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the
Agent at least three Eurodollar Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of
such election; provided, that any such conversion of C/D Rate Loans may,
subject to the third succeeding sentence, only be made on the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. Any such notice of conversion to
Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans shall specify the length of the initial
Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice
the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. If the last day of the
then current Interest Period with respect to C/D Rate Loans that are to be
converted to Eurodollar Loans is not a Eurodollar Business Day, such
conversion shall be made on the next succeeding Eurodollar Business Day, and
during the period from such last day to such succeeding Eurodollar Business
Day such Loans shall bear interest as if they were Base Rate Loans. All or
any part of outstanding Eurodollar Loans, Base Rate Loans and C/D Rate Loans
may be converted as provided herein; provided, that (i) no Loan may be
converted into a Eurodollar Loan or a C/D Rate Loan when any Event of Default
(upon notice from the Administration Agent, on behalf of the Required Banks,
except such notice shall not be required in the case of the Event of Default
described in Section 7(f)) has occurred and is continuing, (ii) any such
conversion may only be made if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.8 shall
not have been

<PAGE>25

contravened and (iii) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan or a C/D
Rate Loan after the date that is one month or 30 days, respectively, prior to
the Termination Date.

(b) Any Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate Loan may be continued as such
upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto
by the Company giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section
1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans;
provided, that no Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate Loan may be continued as such
(i) when any Event of Default (upon notice from the Administration Agent, on
behalf of the Required Banks, except such notice shall not be required in the
case of the Event of Default described in Section 7(f)) has occurred and is
continuing, (ii) if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.8 would be
contravened or (iii) after the date that is one month or 30 days,
respectively, prior to the Termination Date; provided further, that if the
Company shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this
paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding
proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the
last day of such then expiring Interest Period.

2.8 Minimum Amounts of Tranches. All borrowings, conversions and
continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods
hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so
that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans
comprising (a) each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $15,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (b) each C/D Rate Tranche
shall be equal to $15,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess 
thereof and (c) there shall be no more than 12 different Tranches outstanding
at any one time.

2.9 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan
shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect
thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.

(b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

(c) Each C/D Rate Loan shall bear interest for each day during
each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the C/D
Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin.

(d) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan,
(ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any fee or other amount payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or

<PAGE>26

otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which
is (x) in the case of overdue principal, the rate that would otherwise be
applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9
plus 2%, (y) in the case of overdue interest (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) or fees, the rate described in paragraph (b) of this Section
2.9 plus 2% or (z) in the case of other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the then applicable Base Rate, in each case from the date of such
non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before
judgment).

(e) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date; provided, that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
Section 2.9 shall be payable on demand, or, in the absence of demand, weekly
on Friday of each week.

2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest on Loans and
fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days
elapsed; provided, that interest on Base Rate Loans computed with reference to
the Administrative Agent's reference rate shall be calculated on the basis of
a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. 
The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify in writing the
Company and the Banks of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate or of a C/D
Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in
the Ratings, the Base Rate, the C/D Assessment Rate or the C/D Reserve
Percentage and any change in the commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.4(a)
resulting from a change in the Commitment Fee Rate shall become effective as
of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. 
The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify in writing the
Company and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change
in interest rate.

(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company or a Bank, deliver
to the Company or such Bank, as the case may be, a statement showing the
quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate
pursuant to Section 2.9(a) or (c).

(c) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate or all its
Loans shall be assigned for any reason whatsoever or such Reference Bank shall
fail on two consecutive times to furnish quotations of the rate to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(d), such Reference Bank shall 
thereupon cease to be a Reference Bank, and if, as a result of the foregoing,
there shall only be one Reference Bank remaining, the Administrative Agent
(after consultation with the Company and the Banks) shall, by notice to the
Company and the Banks, designate

<PAGE>27

another Bank as a Reference Bank so that there shall at all times be at least
two Reference Banks.

(d) Each Reference Bank shall use its best efforts to furnish
quotations of rates to the Administrative Agent as contemplated hereby. If
any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or shall otherwise fail to supply
such rates to the Administrative Agent upon its request, the rate of interest
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, be determined on the basis
of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks or Reference Bank.

2.11 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. In the event that prior
to the first day of any Interest Period:

(a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company) that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate or the
C/D Rate for such Interest Period, or

(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Required Banks that the Eurodollar Rate or the C/D Rate determined or to
be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Banks (as conclusively certified in writing by
such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such
Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice (confirmed
in writing) thereof to the Company and the Banks as soon as practicable
thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate
Loans, as the case may be, requested to be made on the first day of such
Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (y) any Loans that were to
have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar
Loans or C/D Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be converted to or
continued as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans or C/D
Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be converted, on the first day of such
Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Company at such time as the conditions set forth in (a) and (b)
above are no longer in effect, and until such notice has been delivered by the
Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans shall be
made or continued as such, nor shall the Company have the right to convert
Loans to Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans, as the case may be.

2.12 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing by the
Company from the Banks of Loans, each payment by the Company on account of any
commitment fee or upfront fee hereunder and any reduction of the Commitments
of the Banks shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment

<PAGE>28

Percentages of the Banks. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the
Company on account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro
rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans
then held by the Banks. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by
the Company hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal,
interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and
shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof
to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Banks, at the
Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 9.2, in Dollars and in 
immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payments to the Banks promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any
payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due
and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of
principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate
during such extension. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Eurodollar Business Day, the maturity thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Eurodollar Business Day unless the
result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar
month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding
Eurodollar Business Day.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by any Bank prior to a Borrowing Date that such Bank will not make the
amount that would constitute its portion of the borrowing to be made on such
date available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Bank has made such amount available to the Administrative
Agent on such Borrowing Date, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. 
If such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after
such Borrowing Date, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand
an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal funds rate
during such period as quoted by the Administrative Agent, times (ii) the
amount of such Bank's portion of such borrowing, times (iii) a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such
Borrowing Date to the date on which such Bank's portion of such borrowing
shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the
denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent
submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this Section
2.12(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank's
portion of such borrowing is not in fact made available to the Administrative
Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest
thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder, on
demand, from the Company. If the Company returns to the Administrative Agent
any amount with

<PAGE>29

interest thereon as described in the immediately preceding sentence, such Bank
shall indemnify the Company for the difference, if any, between (i) the
aggregate interest paid by the Company to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence less (ii) the aggregate
interest which actually accrued on such amount prior to its return to the
Administrative Agent.

2.13 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Bank
hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and
convert Domestic Dollar Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be cancelled
and (b) such Bank's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall
be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of
the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such
earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest
Period with respect thereto, the Company shall pay to such Bank such amounts,
if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.16.

2.14 Other Costs; Increased Costs. (a) The Company agrees to pay
to each Bank which requests compensation under this Section 2.14(a) (by
written notice to the Company), on the last day of each Interest Period with
respect to any Eurodollar Loan made by such Bank, so long as such Bank shall 
be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under
Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or, so
long as such Bank may be required by such Board of Governors or by any other
Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any
category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes
any Eurodollar Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Bank and
notified to the Company) representing such Bank's calculation or, if an
accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such
reasonable means of allocation as such Bank shall determine) of the actual
costs, if any, incurred by such Bank while such Eurodollar Loans were
outstanding as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such
Eurodollar Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of
the following for each day while such Eurodollar Loans were outstanding:

(i) the principal amount of the relevant Eurodollar Loans made by
such Bank outstanding on such day; and

<PAGE>30

(ii) the difference between (x) a fraction the numerator of which is
the Eurodollar Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such
Eurodollar Loans, and the denominator of which is one minus the maximum
rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are
imposed by such Board of Governors or other Governmental Authority on
such date minus (y) such numerator; and

(iii) a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of
which is 360.

(b) In the event that any change in any Requirement of Law or in
the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

(i) shall subject any Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever with
respect to this Agreement, any Note or any Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate
Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Bank
in respect thereof (except for taxes covered by Section 2.15 and changes
in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank);

(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans
or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
any office of such Bank which is not otherwise described in Section
2.14(a) or otherwise included in the determination of the C/D Rate; or

(iii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank,
by an amount which such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans or to reduce any
amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the
Company shall pay such Bank within 15 Business Days following demand therefor
any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such increased
cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14(b), it shall promptly notify
the Company, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which
it has become so entitled. 

(c) In the event that any Bank shall have determined that any
change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the 
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Bank or any
corporation controlling such Bank with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether

<PAGE>31

or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made
subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital as a consequence
of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank or such
corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to
capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from
time to time, after submission by such Bank to the Company (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Company shall pay to
such Bank within 15 Business Days following demand therefor such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.

(d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.14 submitted by the relevant Bank, through the Administrative
Agent, to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
The covenants contained in this Section 2.14 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder. Any notice to be given by a Bank under this Section 2.14 after
termination of this Agreement shall be effective only if given within 120 days
after such Bank becomes aware or should have become aware of the events giving
rise to such notice.

2.15 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Company under this
Agreement and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority, excluding, in the case of each Agent and each Bank,
(i) net income taxes, franchise and branch profit taxes (imposed in lieu of
net income taxes) imposed on such Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, as a
result of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction of the
government or taxing authority imposing such tax and such Agent or such Bank
(excluding a connection arising solely from such Agent or such Bank having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under,
or enforced, this Agreement or the Notes) or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein and (ii) any taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings arising after the Closing
Date, solely as a result of or attributable to such Agent or Bank (x) changing
its designated lending office as of the Closing Date to a lending office
located in any other jurisdiction or (y) designating an additional lending
office located in any other jurisdiction (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions and withholdings being hereinafter
called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts
payable to any Agent or any Bank hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts so
payable to such

<PAGE>32

Agent or such Bank shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such
Agent or such Bank (after payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other
amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this
Agreement and the Notes. Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Company, as
promptly as possible thereafter the Company shall send to the Administrative
Agent for its own account or for the account of such Agent or Bank, as the
case may be, a copy of any original official receipt that may be received by
the Company showing payment thereof. If the Company fails to pay any Taxes
when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the
Administrative Agent the receipts that may be received or other available
documentary evidence, the Company shall indemnify the Agents and the Banks for 
any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any
Agent or any Bank to the United States or other Governmental Authority as a
result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section 2.15(a) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder. If any Taxes constituting a withholding tax
of the United States of America or any other Governmental Authority shall be
or become applicable, after the Closing Date, to such payments by the Company
to an Agent or Bank, such Agent or Bank shall use its best efforts to make,
fund and maintain its Loans through another lending office of such Agent or
Bank in another jurisdiction so as to reduce, to the fullest extent possible,
the Company's liability hereunder, if the making, funding or maintenance of
such Loans through such other office does not otherwise materially adversely
affect such Loans or such Agent or Bank.

(b) Prior to the first Interest Payment Date, each Bank that is not
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof
agrees that it will deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (i)
two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
or 4224 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, and (ii) an Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor applicable form. Each such Bank
also agrees to deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent two further
copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor
applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or
before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously
delivered by it to the Company, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may
reasonably be requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, unless in
any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty,
law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery
would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Bank so advises the Company and the Administrative
Agent. Such Bank shall certify (i) in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224, that
it is entitled to receive

<PAGE>33

payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it
is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. The
Company shall not be required to pay any increased amount on account of Taxes
pursuant to this Section 2.15 to an Agent or Bank that fails to furnish any
form or statement that it is required to furnish in accordance with this
Section 2.15(b) and, to the extent required by law, the Company shall be
entitled to deduct Taxes from the payments owed to such Bank or Agent. In the
event that the Company is required to pay any Bank any additional amount or
indemnify any Bank pursuant to Section 2.15(a) and no change in lending office
is made in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.15(a), after the
Company makes such payment, such Bank shall transfer, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 9.6(c), its Loans and Commitment to a Bank
selected by the Company with the approval of such transferor Bank and the
Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

2.16 Indemnity. The Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and to
hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which such Bank may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Company in payment when due of
the principal amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate Loan,
(b) default by the Company in making a borrowing of, conversion into or
continuation of Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans after the Company has given
a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (c) default by the Company in making any prepayment after the
Company has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (d) the making of a voluntary or involuntary prepayment of
Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans on a day which is not the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto or (e) the conversion of Eurodollar Loans 
to Domestic Dollar Loans pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.13 on a day which is
not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, including,
without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the
reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the
deposits from which such funds were obtained. A certificate setting forth the
computation of any amount payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted
by a Bank, through the Administrative Agent, to the Company shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

2.17 Purpose. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used by the
Company solely for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions
(including the acquisition of Federal Systems).

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 

In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement and to
make the Loans herein provided for, the Company hereby represents and warrants
to each Agent and to each Bank that: 

3.1 Financial Condition. (a) The consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as at March 31, 1993 and the related
consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and of cash flows for
the fiscal year ended on such date, reported on by Coopers & Lybrand and (b)
the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as at December 31, 1993 and the related unaudited consolidated statements of
income and retained earnings and of cash flows for the fiscal quarter ended on
such date, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Bank, are
complete and correct in all material respects and present fairly (except, with
respect to interim reports, for normal year-end adjustments) the consolidated
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and
the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal
period then ended. All such financial statements, including the related
schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by
such accountants and as disclosed therein). Except as disclosed on Schedule
3.1 hereto, such audited financial statements, taken together, disclose, in
accordance with GAAP, all material contingent liabilities and liability for
taxes, long-term leases and unusual forward or long-term commitments of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. 

3.2 No Change. Since March 31, 1993 (a) there has been no change
in the business, operations, property or financial or other condition of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) no dividends or other distributions
have been declared, paid or made upon any shares of capital stock of the
Company nor have any shares of capital stock of the Company been redeemed,
retired, purchased or otherwise acquired for value by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries except as permitted by Section 6.5.

3.3 Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each of the Company
and the Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, (b) has the corporate power and authority and the legal right to
own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and
to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that
the failure to be

<PAGE>35

so qualified could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law
except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

3.4 Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The
Company has the corporate power and authority and the legal right to make,
deliver and perform this Agreement and the Notes and to borrow hereunder and
has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the borrowings on the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Notes and to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Notes. No
consent or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in respect of any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder 
or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of
this Agreement and the Notes, other than those which have been obtained or
made and are in full force and effect. This Agreement has been, and each Note
will be, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company. This Agreement
constitutes, and each Note when executed and delivered will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity
or at law).

3.5 No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Notes by the Company, the borrowings hereunder and the use
of the proceeds thereof, will not violate any Requirement of Law or any
Contractual Obligation applicable to the Company or of any of the
Subsidiaries, and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any of its or their respective properties or revenues pursuant
to any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation.

3.6 No Material Litigation. No litigation, investigation or
proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by or against the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties
or revenues (a) with respect to this Agreement and the Notes or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, excluding litigation described in the
Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1993 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (but not excluding developments with
respect thereto occurring after March 31, 1993 not described in such Form 10-
K).

<PAGE>36

3.7 No Default. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is
in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

3.8 Ownership of Property; Liens. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries has good record and marketable title in fee simple to or valid
leasehold interests in all its real property, and good title to all its other
property, and none of such property is subject to any Lien, except as
permitted in Section 6.3 and except where the failure to have such title could
not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

3.9 Taxes. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has filed or
caused to be filed all tax returns which to the knowledge of the Company are
required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on
said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and
all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by
any Governmental Authority (other than those the amount or validity of which
is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the
books of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and other than
those the non-payment of which could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect); and no federal income tax liens
have been filed and, to the knowledge of the Company, no claims are being
asserted with respect to any such taxes, fees or other charges, except any
such claims which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. 

3.10 Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loans
hereunder will be used for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any
"margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms
under Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as
now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose which
violates the provisions of the Regulations of such Board of Governors. If
requested by any Bank or the Administrative Agent, the Company will furnish to
the Administrative Agent and each Bank a statement to the foregoing effect in
conformity with the requirements of Federal Reserve Form U-1 referred to in
said Regulation U.

3.11 ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which
this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan which has
resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a liability to the
Company or any Substantial Subsidiary in excess of

<PAGE>37

$2,000,000, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single
Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has
arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued
benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to
fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the
date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed, by more than
$35,000,000, the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued
benefits; provided, however, that with respect to the defined benefit pension
plan to be established by Federal Systems, such amount shall be $50,000,000
rather than $35,000,000. Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled
Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan,
and neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become
subject to any liability under ERISA if the Company or any such Commonly
Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as
of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, where such liability could, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No such
Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.

3.12 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. The Company is not
an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Company is not subject to regulation under any Federal or State statute or
regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

3.13 Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.13, the
Subsidiaries listed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal
year ended March 31, 1993 constitute all of the Subsidiaries of the Company on
the Effective Date.

3.14 Environmental Matters. Each of the representations and
warranties set forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this Section 3.14 is
true and correct with respect to each parcel of real property owned or
operated by the Company or any Subsidiary (the "Properties"), except to the
extent that (i) the facts and circumstances giving rise to any such failure to
be so true and correct could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) the Company and the Subsidiaries are fully indemnified
against any liabilities which may result from any such failure to be so true
and correct:

(a) The Properties do not contain, and have not previously
contained, in, on, or under, including, without limitation, the soil and
groundwater thereunder, any Hazardous Materials in concentrations which
violate Environmental Laws.

<PAGE>38

(b) The Properties and all operations and facilities at the
Properties are in compliance with all Environmental Laws, and there is no
Hazardous Materials contamination or violation of any Environmental Law
which could interfere with the continued operation of any of the
Properties or impair the fair saleable value of any thereof.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received
any written complaint, notice of violation, alleged violation,
investigation or advisory action or of potential liability or of
potential responsibility regarding environmental protection matters or
permit compliance with regard to the Properties, nor is the Company aware
that any Governmental Authority is threatening to deliver to the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries any such notice.

(d) Hazardous Materials have not been generated, treated, stored,
disposed of, at, on or under any of the Properties, nor have any
Hazardous Materials been transferred from the Properties to any other
location in violation of any Environmental Law.

(e) There are no governmental, administrative actions or judicial
proceedings pending or (to the knowledge of the Company) contemplated
under any Environmental Laws to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is or (to the knowledge of the Company) will be named as a
party with respect to the Properties, nor are there any consent decrees
or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or other orders,
or other administrative or judicial requirements outstanding under any
Environmental Law with respect to any of the Properties. 

3.15 Full Disclosure. All information heretofore furnished by the
Company to any Agent or any Bank for purposes of or in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby is, and all such information
hereafter furnished by the Company to any Agent or any Bank will be, true and
accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such information is
stated or certified. The Company has disclosed to the Banks in writing any
and all facts which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

SECTION 8. THE AGENTS

8.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates Morgan as
the Documentation Agent of such Bank under this Agreement and each such Bank
irrevocably authorizes Morgan, as the Documentation Agent for such Bank, to
take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Documentation Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank hereby irrevocably
designates and appoints Chemical as the Administrative Agent of such Bank
under this Agreement, and each such Bank irrevocably authorizes Chemical, as
the

<PAGE>56

Administrative Agent for such Bank, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such powers and perform such
duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of
this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each of
Barclays and Continental as an Agent of such Bank under this Agreement, and
each such Bank irrevocably authorizes each of Barclays and Continental, as an
Agent for such Bank, to take action on its behalf under this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly
set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied 
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agents.

8.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agents may execute any of their
duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Agents shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by any of them with
reasonable care.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i)
liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such
Person under or in connection with this Agreement (except for its or such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in
any manner to any of the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations
or warranties made by the Company or any officer thereof contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred
to or provided for in, or received by such Agent under or in connection with,
this Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or the Notes or for any
failure of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as
to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or records
of the Company.

8.4 Reliance by Agents. The Agents shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram,
telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or
conversation believed by them to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the
Company), independent accountants and other

<PAGE>57

experts selected by the Agents. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat
the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written
notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed
with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks
as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction
by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred
by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the Notes in accordance with
a request of the Required Banks, and such request and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all
future holders of the Notes.

8.5 Notice of Default. The Agents shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank or
the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event
that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
reasonably directed by the Required Banks; provided, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from 
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Banks. Each Bank expressly
acknowledges that no Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Company, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by such Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to
the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
the Company and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter
into this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently
and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Bank, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue
to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and/or decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations,

<PAGE>58

property, financial and/or other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required
to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent
shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or
other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and
other condition or creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the
possession of such Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify each Agent in
its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company and without
limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably according to their
respective Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including without limitation at any time following the payment of the Notes)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken
or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from such Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any such amount with respect to
which the Banks have indemnified such Agent is recovered from the Company,
such Agent shall return the amount so recovered to the Banks which so
indemnified such Agent, but without interest, unless the Company has paid
interest. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the
Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder. 

8.8 Each Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Company as though such Agent were not an Agent
hereunder. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note
issued to it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an
Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include each Agent in its
individual capacity. Each Bank and Transferee acknowledges that each of
Morgan, Chemical, Barclays and Continental is an agent and a lender under the
Revolving Credit Agreement. 

8.9 Successor Agents. An Agent may resign as such upon 10 days'
notice to the Banks and the Company; provided, that such resignation shall not
become effective until a successor Agent is appointed in accordance with this
Section 8.9. If such Agent shall resign as an Agent under this Agreement,
then the

<PAGE>59

Required Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the
Banks which successor agent shall be approved by the Company, whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such Agent,
and any references to such Agent herein or in the Notes shall mean such
successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights,
powers and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further
act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the Notes. After any retiring Agent's resignation
as such, the provisions of this Section 8.9 shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under
this Agreement.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement, any Note, nor
any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1. With the written consent
of the Required Banks, the Documentation Agent, on behalf of the Banks and the
Agents, and the Company may, from time to time, enter into written amendments,
supplements or modifications hereto and to the Notes for the purpose of adding
any provisions to this Agreement or the Notes or changing in any manner the
rights of the Banks or of the Company hereunder or thereunder or waiving, on
such terms and conditions as the Documentation Agent may specify in such
instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the Notes or any

the amount or extend the scheduled maturity of any Note, or reduce the rate or

each Bank affected thereby, or (b) amend, modify or waive any provision of
this Section 9.1, or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Banks, or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Company of any

Cash Collateral Account other than in accordance with Section 2.6 in each case
without the written consent of all the Banks, or (c) amend, modify or waive
any provision of Section 8 without the written consent of the then Agents. 
Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply
equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the Company, the Banks,
the Agents and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver,
the Company, the Banks and the Agents shall be restored to their former
position and rights hereunder and under the outstanding Notes, and any Default
or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but
no such

<PAGE>60

waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or
impair any right consequent thereon.

; provided, that any notice, request or demand to or upon the Agents or the
Banks pursuant to Sections 2.3, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 shall not be effective until
received.

9.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the Notes shall operate
as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided or
provided in the Notes are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

9.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document, certificate
or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes.

9.5 Payment of Expenses and Taxes. The Company agrees (a) to pay
or reimburse each Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and execution of, and any
amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the Notes and any
other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and

<PAGE>62

disbursements of counsel to the Agents, (b) to pay or reimburse each Bank and
the Agents for all their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the
Notes and any such other documents, including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel to the Agents and to the several Banks (including,
without limitation, the allocated costs of in-house counsel), (c) to pay,
indemnify, and hold each Bank and the Agents harmless from, any and all
recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or
resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any,
which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
execution and delivery of, or consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any
waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the Notes and any
such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank and the
Agents (and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents)
harmless from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to or arising out
of the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, syndication and
administration of this Agreement, the Notes and any such other documents and
the use of proceeds of the Loans (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"indemnified liabilities"); provided, that the Company shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Agent or any Bank with respect to indemnified
liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
such Agent or any such Bank. The agreements in this Section 9.5 shall survive
repayment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

9.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Banks. (a) 
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company,
the Banks, the Agents, all future holders of the Notes, and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign or transfer any 
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of each Bank.

(b) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or
more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any
Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held by such Bank, the Commitment of such
Bank or any other interest of such Bank hereunder; provided, that if the
Participant is not an Affiliate of such Bank or another Bank, such Bank shall
obtain the prior consent of the Company to such sale of participating
interests (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
provided further, that such Bank shall reserve solely unto itself, and shall
not grant to any Participant, any part or all of its right to agree to the
amendment, modification or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement, its
Note or any document related thereto, except to

<PAGE>63

the extent that such amendment, modification or waiver would reduce the
principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone the date of the
final maturity of, or any date fixed for any payment of interest on, the
Notes, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. In the event
of any such sale by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, such
Bank's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for
all purposes under this Agreement and the Company, the Documentation Agent,
and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. The Company agrees that if amounts outstanding under this
Agreement and the Notes are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or
shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and any Note to
the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement or any Note; provided, that such
right of setoff shall be subject to the obligation of such Participant to
share with the Banks, and the Banks agree to share with such Participant, as
provided in Section 9.7. The Company also agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.5 with respect
to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to
time; provided, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater
amount pursuant to such Sections than the transferor Bank would have been
entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred
by such transferor Bank to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

(c) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, and (if the Purchasing Bank is
not an Affiliate of such Bank or an existing Bank) with the prior consent of
the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), at any time
sell to one or more banks or financial institutions ("Purchasing Banks") all
or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes,
pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Bank
and such transferor Bank, and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its
acceptance and recording in the Register; provided, that if the Purchasing
Bank is not an Affiliate of such Bank or an existing Bank any sale of Loans
shall be in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) such Bank's Commitment and
(ii) $6,250,000; and provided, further, that no Bank may sell any part of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes to a Purchasing Bank
unless a ratable share of its rights and obligations under the Revolving
Credit Agreement are simultaneously sold to such Purchasing Bank. Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and

<PAGE>64

recording, from and after the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to
such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Bank thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder with a
Commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the transferor Bank thereunder shall,
to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of a Commitment
Transfer Supplement covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Bank shall
cease to be a party hereto). Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be
deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent,
necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting
adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such
Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such
transferor Bank under this Agreement and the Notes. On or prior to the
Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, the Company, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the
order of such Purchasing Bank in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by
it pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement and, if the transferor Bank
has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the transferor
Bank in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new
Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of
the Notes replaced thereby. The Note surrendered by the transferor Bank shall
be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Company marked "cancelled".

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred
to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to
it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Company, the
Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Company or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. 

(e) Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed
by a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank together with payment to the
Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $4,000, the
Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Commitment Transfer
Supplement and (ii) on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto
record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of
such acceptance and recordation to the Documentation Agent, the Banks and the
Company. 

<PAGE>65

(f) The Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant
or Purchasing Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any
and all financial information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company
and its affiliates which has been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of
the Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such
Bank by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such Bank's credit
evaluation of the Company and its affiliates prior to becoming a party to this
Agreement; provided, that such Transferee or prospective Transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section
9.14 hereof.

(g) If, pursuant to this Section 9.6, any interest in this
Agreement or any Note is transferred to any Transferee which is organized
under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State
thereof, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with 
the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to the transferor Bank
(for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Agents and the Company) that
under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to be withheld by
the Administrative Agent, the Company or the transferor Bank with respect to
any payments to be made to such Transferee in respect of the Loans, (ii) to
furnish to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank
registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Company) either
U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form
1001 (wherein such Transferee claims entitlement to complete exemption from
U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder) and an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor applicable form (wherein
such Transferee claims exemption from United States backup withholding tax)
and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Agents and the
Company) to provide the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing
Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Company) a
new Form 4224 or 1001 or Form W-8 or W-9 upon the expiration or obsolescence
of any previously delivered form and comparable statements in accordance with
applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments duly executed and
completed by such Transferee, and to comply from time to time with all
applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such withholding and
backup withholding tax exemptions.

(h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Bank from pledging or
assigning any Note to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable
law.

9.7 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank")
shall receive any payment of all or part of its Loans or interest thereon, or
receive any collateral in respect of its Loans (in each case whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of
the nature referred to in clause (f) of Section 7, or otherwise)

<PAGE>66

in a greater proportion than any such payment to and collateral received by
any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans or interest
thereon, or Loans or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for
cash from the other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's Loans, or
shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or
the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably
with each of the Banks; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits
returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Company
agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's Loans may
exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-
off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct
holder of such portion.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by
law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the Company, any
such notice being expressly waived by the Company to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Company
hereunder or under the Notes (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise) to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in
any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency,
in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or
unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the
account of the Company. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and
the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
Bank; provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. 

9.8 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts and all
of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with the Company and the Agent.

9.10 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES AND THE RIGHTS
AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT

<PAGE>67

AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

9.11 Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Company hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Notes, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgement in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive
general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, the courts
of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York,
and appellate courts from any thereof;

(b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in
such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such
action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not
to plead or claim the same;

(c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding
may be affected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
(or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the
Company at its address set forth in Section 9.2 or at such other address
of which the Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

(d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit
the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

(e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right
it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding
referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or
consequential damages.

9.12 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION
OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
THEREIN.

9.13 Integration. This Agreement represents the agreement of the
Company, the Agents and the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any
Agent or any Bank relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set
forth or referred to herein or in the Notes.

9.14 Confidentiality. The Banks shall hold all non-public
information obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement which has 
been identified as such by the Company in accordance with their customary
procedures for handling

<PAGE>68

confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound
banking practices but in any event may make disclosure reasonably required by
a bona fide prospective Purchasing Bank or Participant in connection with the
contemplated transfer of any Note or participation therein (subject to such
prospective Purchasing Bank's or Participant's compliance with Section 9.6(f)
hereof) or as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or
representative thereof or pursuant to legal process.

CREDIT AGREEMENT

[FORM OF OPINION OF WILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER]

February 23, 1994

To the Banks listed on Schedule I
hereto and to the Agents
referred to below

Dear Sirs:

We have acted as counsel to Loral Corporation (the "Company") in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the
following documents:

(a) the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of February 23,
1994 (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, the banks from time to
time party thereto (the "Banks"), Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New
York, as documentation agent for the Banks (the "Documentation Agent"),
Chemical Bank, as administrative agent for the Banks (the "Administrative
Agent"), and Barclays Bank PLC and Continental Bank, N.A., as agents for
the Banks (along with the Administrative Agent and the Documentation Agent,
the "Agents"); and

(b) the Notes of the Company, dated the date hereof (the "Notes").

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.1(b) of the
Credit Agreement. Terms used herein which are defined in the Credit Agreement
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement, unless
otherwise defined herein.

In connection with this opinion, we have made such examinations of law
and inquiries of officers of the Company and have examined certificates of
public officials, execution copies of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and
such corporate documents and records of the Company and certificates of public
officials and officers of the Company, and such other documents, as we have
deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In such
examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity
of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic
original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or
photostatic copies. As to various questions of fact

<PAGE>97

material to this opinion, we have relied upon the certifications,
representations and warranties of officers and representatives of the Company
and upon the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Credit Agreement.

As used herein, "Indentures" is the collective reference to the 9-1/8%
Indenture, the 7% Indenture and the 8-3/8% Indenture. 

A. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Company (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) has the
corporate power and authority to own and operate its property and to conduct its
business in the manner in which it is currently conducted, and (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of New
York, Arizona, California, Washington, D.C., Florida, Maryland, Ohio and
Virginia.

2. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute, make
and deliver the Credit Agreement and the Notes and to borrow and perform its
obligations under the Credit Agreement and Notes. The Company has taken all
necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the borrowings contemplated by the
Credit Agreement. No consent or authorization of, or filing with, any person
pursuant to the Indentures or any Governmental Authority, is required by the
Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes
and the borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement except for filings which
are contemplated by the Credit Agreement, and filings of UCC financing
statements, if any, necessary in connection with the cash collateralization
contemplated by Section 2.6 of the Credit Agreement.

3. The Credit Agreement and Notes have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company. Each of the Credit Agreement 
and the Notes constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation 
of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance 
with their respective terms, except as provided in
paragraph B hereof (other than paragraph B(3)) and except that we express no
opinion as to the enforceability of the last sentence of Section 9.7(a) or
Section 9.7(b), to the extent that it purports to grant to any Bank set-off
rights with respect to any amounts owed by the Company under the Credit
Agreement or the Notes to any other Bank, and no opinion is expressed as to the
enforceability of Section 2.9(d) to the extent it purports to specify the rate
of interest payable after judgment, or as to any indemnity provision which
includes indemnities for environmental matters to the extent the same conflicts
with Section 107(e) of 

<PAGE>98

CERCLA or any comparable provision of laws of the State of New York.

4. Subject to the qualifications set forth in this paragraph, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and
the Notes and the borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement will not
violate the restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, any
law, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America
or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any judgment, decree
or order known to us of any court or governmental or regulatory authority (each
of which is an "Order of Law") or any provision of the Indentures and will not
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the properties or
revenues of the Company pursuant to any such Order of Law or any provision of
the Indentures. We express no opinion, however, as to any law, rule or
regulation (i) the existence or absence of which does not have any material
adverse effect on the Agents or the Banks and does not deprive the Agents or the
Banks of any material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes, (ii)
which violation or Lien can be readily cured without significant delay or
expense to the Agents or the Banks, without loss to the Agents or the Banks of
any material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and without any
material adverse effect on the Agents or the Banks during the period of such
violation or Lien, or (iii) any violation of law, rule or regulation which
results from the status of the Agents or the Banks or facts relating
specifically to the Agents or the Banks.

5. To the best of our knowledge, except as may be described in the
Credit Agreement or in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
1993, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority is pending or threatened by or against the Company or any
Subsidiary or against any of their respective properties or revenues (a) with
respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes, or the performance by the Company
of its obligations thereunder, or (b) which, we have been advised by the
officers of the Company, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, property or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

6. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

B. The opinions expressed herein, however, are subject
to the following:

1. We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and do not
purport to be experts in the laws of jurisdictions other than the State of New
York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws
of the United States

<PAGE>99

of America and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the present laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware and federal laws of the United States, in each case
of the type typically applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the
Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the present judicial interpretations thereof
and to the facts as they presently exist.

2. The opinions set forth in Paragraph A, insofar as they relate to
the enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, are subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to
equitable principles affecting the availability of equitable relief (regardless
of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), 
including principles of commercial reasonableness or conscionability and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Such principles of equity are
of general application, and in applying such principles, a court, among other
things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt for an
immaterial default. Such principles applied by a court might include a
requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and good faith. Such
requirement might be applied, for example, to any provision of the Credit
Agreement and the Notes purporting to authorize conclusive determinations by any
Bank or any Agent. Insofar as provisions contained in the Credit Agreement
provide for indemnification, the enforcement thereof may be limited by public
policy considerations.

3. We have made no independent investigations except as specifically
set forth herein.

4. We express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any Bank or any Agent (or
any assignee of any of the rights and/or obligations of any Bank or any Agent
under the Credit Agreement and the Notes) may be located or wherein enforcement
of the Credit Agreement and the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of
interest legally chargeable or collectible.

5. We express no opinion as to (i) whether a Federal or state court
outside of the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New York law
provided for in the Credit Agreement and the Notes, (ii) sections of the Credit
Agreement insofar as such sections relate to the subject matter jurisdiction of
the courts specified therein to adjudicate any controversy related to such
Credit Agreement and the Notes, (iii) sections of the Credit Agreement insofar
as such sections relate to the waiver of trial by jury or (iv) the waiver of
defenses and the waiver of objection to venue set forth in the Credit Agreement
with respect to proceedings in the courts specified therein.

<PAGE>100

6. We have assumed that all parties other than the Company have duly
authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement.

7. We have assumed that you, as well as all other parties other than
the Company, have all requisite corporate power and authority and have taken all
necessary action to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Credit
Agreement.

8. This opinion has been issued solely for the benefit of the Agents
and the Banks and no one else has the right to rely upon it. We further advise
you that we are not assuming any obligation to notify the Agents or the Banks of
any changes in this opinion as a result of any facts that may come to our
attention in the future which may cause a change in this opinion.

9. This opinion is limited to matters expressly set forth herein and
no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly
stated herein.

Very truly yours,

WILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER

TO 364-DAY 
CREDIT AGREEMENT

[FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL]

February 23, 1994

To the Banks listed on Schedule I
hereto and to the Agents
referred to below

Dear Sirs:

I am Vice President, Assistant Secretary and General Counsel of Loral
Corporation (the "Company") and have acted as such in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the following documents:

(a) the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of February 23,
1994 (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, the banks from time to
time party thereto (the "Banks"), Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New
York, as documentation agent for the Banks (the "Documentation Agent"),
Chemical Bank, as administrative agent for the Banks (the "Administrative
Agent"), and Barclays Bank PLC and Continental Bank, N.A., as agents for
the Banks (along with the Administrative Agent and the Documentation Agent,
the "Agents"); and

(b) the Notes of the Company, dated the date hereof (the "Notes").

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.1(b) of the
Credit Agreement. Terms used herein which are defined in the Credit Agreement
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement, unless
otherwise defined herein.

In connection with this opinion, I have made such examinations of law
and have examined executed copies of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and such
corporate documents and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certificates of public officials and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and such other documents, as I have deemed necessary or
appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In such examination, I have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents
of

<PAGE>102

all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. As
to various questions of fact material to this opinion, I have relied upon
certifications of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the
representations of the Company set forth in the Credit Agreement.

A. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion
that:

1. Each of the Company and each Subsidiary (a) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, (b) has the corporate power and authority to own and
operate its property and to conduct its business in the manner in which it
proposes to do so, and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and
in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership of
property or the conduct or proposed conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except to the extent that the failure to so qualify could
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations, property or financial or other condition of the
Company.

2. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute,
make and deliver the Credit Agreement and the Notes and to borrow and
perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and Notes. The Company
has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the
borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement.

3. The Credit Agreement and Notes have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company. Each of the Credit Agreement and
the Notes constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms,
except as provided in paragraph B hereof and except that I express no
opinion as to the enforceability of the last sentence of Section 9.7(a) or
Section 9.7(b), to the extent that it purports to grant to any Bank set-off
rights with respect to any amounts owed by the Company under the Credit
Agreement or the Notes to any other Bank, and no opinion is expressed as to
the enforceability of Section 2.9(d) to the extent it purports to specify
the rate of interest payable after judgment, or as to any indemnity
provision which includes indemnities for environmental matters to the
extent the same conflicts with Section 107(e)

of CERCLA or any comparable provision of laws of the State of New York.

4. No consent or authorization of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority or any other Person is required by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance,
validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the
borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement, except for filings which
are contemplated by the Credit Agreement, and filings of UCC financing
statements, if any, necessary in connection with the cash collateralization
contemplated by Section 2.6 of the Credit Agreement. I express no opinion,
however, as to any such consent, authorization, filing or act (i) the
existence or absence of which does not have any material adverse effect on
the Agents or the Banks and does not deprive the Agents or the Banks of any
material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes or (ii) which can
be readily cured or obtained without significant delay or expense to the
Agents or the Banks, without loss to the Agents or the Banks of any
material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes and without any
material adverse effect on the Agents or the Banks during the period in
which such consent, authorization, filing or act was not obtained or
effected.

5. Subject to the qualifications set forth in this paragraph, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement
and the Notes and the borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement will
not violate the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, any law, rule or
regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America or the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any judgment, decree or
order known to me of any court or governmental or regulatory authority
(each of which is an "Order of Law") or any Contractual Obligation of the 
Company or its Subsidiaries, and will not result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues
pursuant to any such Order of Law or Contractual Obligation. I express no
opinion, however, as to any law, rule or regulation (i) the existence or
absence of which does not have any material adverse effect on the Agents or
the Banks and does not deprive the Agents or the Banks of any material
benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes, (ii) which violation or
Lien can be readily cured without significant delay or expense to the
Agents or the Banks, without loss to

<PAGE>104

the Agents or the Banks of any material benefit under the Credit Agreement
and the Notes and without any material adverse effect on the Agents or the
Banks during the period of such violation or Lien, or (iii) any violation
of law, rule or regulation which results from the Agents' or the Banks'
status or facts relating specifically to the Agents or the Banks.

6. To the best of my knowledge, except as may be described in the
Credit Agreement or in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
1993, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or threatened by or against
the Company or any Subsidiary or against any of its respective properties
or revenues (a) with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes, or the
performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, or (b) which
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, property or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

B. The opinions expressed herein, however, are subject to the
following:

1. I am a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia and do not
purport to be an expert in the laws of jurisdictions other than the
District of Columbia, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
and the Federal laws of the United States of America and I do not express
any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the present laws
of the District of Columbia, the State of New York (subject to the
qualification stated below), the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and federal laws of the United States, in each case of the type
typically applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit
Agreement and the Notes, and the present judicial interpretations thereof
and to the facts as they presently exist. I am not admitted to the Bar of
the State of New York. As to any opinion as to the laws of the State of
New York, I have relied solely on the opinion dated today, a copy of which
is being delivered to you, of Michael B. Targoff, Esq., Senior Vice
President, Secretary and former General Counsel of the Company.

2. The opinions set forth in Paragraph A, insofar as they relate to
the enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, are subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws

<PAGE>105

affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to
equitable principles affecting the availability of equitable relief
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law), including principles of commercial reasonableness or
conscionability and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
Such principles of equity are of general application, and in applying such
principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to
accelerate the maturity of a debt for an immaterial default. Such
principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor
act with reasonableness and good faith. Such requirement might be applied, 
for example, to any provision of the Credit Agreement and the Notes
purporting to authorize conclusive determinations by any Bank or any Agent. 
Insofar as provisions contained in the Credit Agreement provide for
indemnification, the enforcement thereof may be limited by public policy
considerations.

3. I express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any Bank or any Agent
(or any assignee of any of the rights and/or obligations of any Bank or any
Agent under the Credit Agreement and the Notes) may be located or wherein
enforcement of the Credit Agreement and the Notes may be sought which
limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.

4. I express no opinion as to (i) whether a Federal or state court
outside of the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New
York law provided for in the Credit Agreement and the Notes, (ii) sections
of the Credit Agreement and the Notes insofar as such sections relate to
the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts specified therein to
adjudicate any controversy related to such Credit Agreement and the Notes,
(iii) sections of the Credit Agreement insofar as such sections relate to
the waiver of trial by jury or (iv) the waiver of defenses and the waiver
of objection to venue set forth in the Credit Agreement with respect to
proceedings in the courts specified therein.

5. I have assumed that all parties other than the Company have duly
authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement.

6. I have assumed that you, as well as all other parties other than
the Company, have all requisite corporate power and authority and have
taken all necessary action to

<PAGE>106

consummate the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.

7. This opinion is limited to matters expressly set forth herein and
no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly
stated herein.

This opinion has been issued solely for the benefit of the Agents and
the Banks and no one else has the right to rely upon it. I further advise you
that I am not assuming any obligation to notify the Agents or the Banks of any
changes in this opinion as a result of any facts that may come to my attention
in the future which may cause a change in this opinion.

Very truly yours,

Eric J. Zahler
General Counsel

[FORM OF COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT]

COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT

COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT, dated as of the date set forth in Item
1 of Schedule I hereto, among the Transferor Bank set forth in Item 2 of
Schedule I hereto (the "Transferor Bank"), each Purchasing Bank set forth in
Item 3 of Schedule I hereto (each, a "Purchasing Bank"), and CHEMICAL BANK, as
administrative agent for the Banks under the Credit Agreement described below
(in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent").

W I T N E S S E T H :

WHEREAS, this Commitment Transfer Supplement is being executed and
delivered in accordance with subsection 9.6(c) of the 364-Day Revolving Credit
Agreement, dated as of February 23, 1994, among Loral Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company"), the Transferor Bank, the other Banks party thereto,
Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as Documentation Agent thereunder,
the Administrative Agent, and Barclays Bank PLC and Continental Bank, N.A., as
Agents thereunder (as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified in accordance with the terms thereof, the "Credit Agreement"; terms
defined therein being used herein as therein defined);

WHEREAS, each Purchasing Bank (if it is not already a Bank party to
the Credit Agreement) wishes to become a Bank party to the Credit Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Transferor Bank is selling and assigning to each
Purchasing Bank, rights, obligations and commitments under the Credit Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1. Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of five counterparts of
this Commitment Transfer Supplement, to each of which is attached a fully
completed Schedule I and Schedule II, and each of which has been executed by the
Transferor Bank and each Purchasing Bank (and any other Person required by the
Credit Agreement to execute this Commitment Transfer Supplement), the
Administrative Agent will transmit to the Company, the Transferor 

<PAGE>110

Bank and each Purchasing Bank a Transfer Effective Notice, substantially in the
form of Schedule III to this Commitment Transfer Supplement (a "Transfer
Effective Notice"). Such Transfer Effective Notice shall set forth, inter alia,
the date on which the transfer effected by this Commitment Transfer Supplement
shall become effective (the "Transfer Effective Date"), which date shall be the
fifth Business Day following the date of such Transfer Effective Notice unless a
shorter period is agreed to by the Administrative Agent. From and after the
Transfer Effective Date each Purchasing Bank shall be a Bank party to the Credit
Agreement for all purposes thereof.

2. At or before 12:00 Noon, local time of the Transferor Bank, on
the Transfer Effective Date, each Purchasing Bank shall pay to the Transferor
Bank, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the purchase price, as
agreed between the Transferor Bank and such Purchasing Bank (the "Purchase
Price"), of the portion being purchased by such Purchasing Bank (such Purchasing
Bank's "Purchased Percentage") of the outstanding Loans and other amounts owing
to the Transferor Bank under the Credit Agreement and the Notes. Effective upon
receipt by the Transferor Bank of the Purchase Price from a Purchasing Bank, the
Transferor Bank hereby irrevocably sells, assigns and transfers to such
Purchasing Bank, without recourse, representation or warranty, and each
Purchasing Bank hereby irrevocably purchases, takes and assumes from the
Transferor Bank, such Purchasing Bank's Purchased Percentage of the Commitments
and the presently outstanding Loans and other amounts owing to the Transferor
Bank under the Credit Agreement and the Notes together with all instruments,
documents and collateral security pertaining thereto.

3. The Transferor Bank has made arrangements with each Purchasing
Bank with respect to (i) the portion, if any, to be paid, and the date or dates
for payment, by the Transferor Bank to such Purchasing Bank of any fees
heretofore received by the Transferor Bank pursuant to the Credit Agreement
prior to the Transfer Effective Date and (ii) the portion, if any, to be paid,
and the date or dates for payment, by such Purchasing Bank to the Transferor
Bank of fees or interest received by such Purchasing Bank pursuant to the Credit
Agreement from and after the Transfer Effective Date.

4. (a) All principal payments that would otherwise be payable from
and after the Transfer Effective Date to or for the account of the Transferor
Bank pursuant to the Credit Agreement and its Note shall, instead, be payable to
or for the account of the Transferor Bank and the Purchasing Banks, as the case
may be, in accordance with their respective interests as reflected in this
Commitment Transfer Supplement.

(b) All interest, fees and other amounts that would otherwise accrue
for the account of the Transferor Bank from and after the Transfer Effective
Date pursuant to the Credit

<PAGE>111

Agreement and its Note shall, instead, accrue for the account of, and be payable
to, the Transferor Bank and the Purchasing Banks, as the case may be, in
accordance with their respective interests as reflected in this Commitment
Transfer Supplement. In the event that any amount of interest, fees or other
amounts accruing prior to the Transfer Effective Date was included in the
Purchase Price paid by any Purchasing Bank, the Transferor Bank and each
Purchasing Bank will make appropriate arrangements for payment by the Transferor
Bank to such Purchasing Bank of such amount upon receipt thereof from the
Company.

5. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date, the Transferor Bank
will deliver to the Administrative Agent its Note. On or prior to the Transfer
Effective Date, the Company will deliver to the Administrative Agent Notes for
each Purchasing Bank and the Transferor Bank, in each case in principal amounts 
reflecting, in accordance with the Credit Agreement, their Commitments (as
adjusted pursuant to this Commitment Transfer Supplement). As provided in
subsection 9.6(c) of the Credit Agreement, each such new Note shall be dated the
Closing Date. Promptly after the Transfer Effective Date, the Administrative
Agent will send to each of the Transferor Bank and the Purchasing Banks its new
Note, along with a schedule setting forth the amounts of Loans outstanding for
the Transferor Bank and each Purchasing Bank, and will send to the Company the
superseded Note of the Transferor Bank, marked "Cancelled". 

6. Concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, the
Transferor Bank will provide to each Purchasing Bank (if it is not already a
Bank party to the Credit Agreement) conformed copies of all documents delivered
to such Transferor Bank on the Closing Date in satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in the Credit Agreement.

7. Each of the parties to this Commitment Transfer Supplement agrees
that at any time and from time to time upon the written request of any other
party, it will execute and deliver such further documents and do such further
acts and things as such other party may reasonably request in order to effect
the purposes of this Commitment Transfer Supplement.

8. By executing and delivering this Commitment Transfer Supplement,
the Transferor Bank and each Purchasing Bank confirm to and agree with each
other and the Administrative Agent and the Banks as follows: (i) other than the
representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
interest being assigned hereby free and clear of any adverse claim, the
Transferor Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with the Credit Agreement or the execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of the Credit
Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
thereto; (ii) the Transferor Bank makes no

<PAGE>112

representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of the Company or the performance or observance by the
Company of any of its obligations under the Credit Agreement, the Notes or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) each Purchasing
Bank confirms that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in subsection 3.1, the financial
statements delivered pursuant to subsection 5.1, if any, and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Commitment Transfer Supplement; (iv)
each Purchasing Bank will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, the Transferor Bank or any other Bank and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under the Credit
Agreement; (v) each Purchasing Bank appoints and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under the Credit Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto,
all in accordance with Section 8 of the Credit Agreement; and (vi) each
Purchasing Bank agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all
of the obligations which by the terms of the Credit Agreement are required to be
performed by it as a Bank.

9. Each party hereto represents and warrants to and agrees with the
Administrative Agent that it is aware of and will comply with the provision of
subsection 9.6(g) of the Credit Agreement.

10. Schedule II hereto sets forth the revised Commitments and
Commitment Percentages of the Transferor Bank and each Purchasing Bank as well
as administrative information with respect to each Purchasing Bank. 

11. THIS COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Commitment
Transfer Supplement to be executed by their respective duly authorized officers
on Schedule I hereto as of the date set forth in Item 1 of Schedule I hereto.

SECTION 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF COMMITMENTS

2.1 Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each Bank severally agrees to make revolving credit loans
(the "Loans") to the Company from time to time during the Commitment Period in
an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the
lesser of (i) such Bank's Commitment and (ii) such Bank's Commitment
Percentage of the aggregate Original Commitment. During the Commitment Period
the Company may use the Commitments by borrowing, prepaying the Loans in whole
or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof.

(b) The Loans may from time to time be (i) Eurodollar Loans, (ii)
Base Rate Loans, (iii) C/D Rate Loans or (iv) a combination thereof, as
determined by the Company and notified to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with Sections 2.3 and 2.7; provided, that no Loan shall be made as
a Eurodollar Loan or a C/D Rate Loan after the day that is one month or 30
days, respectively, prior to the Termination Date.

<PAGE>21

2.2 Revolving Credit Notes. The Loans made by each Bank shall be
evidenced by a promissory note of the Company, substantially in the form of
Exhibit A, with appropriate insertions as to payee, date and principal amount
(a "Note"), payable to the order of such Bank and in a principal amount equal
to the lesser of (a) the amount of the initial Commitment of such Bank and (b)
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans made by such Bank. Each
Bank is hereby authorized to record the date, Type and amount of each Loan
made by such Bank, each continuation thereof, each conversion of all or a
portion thereof to another Type, the date and amount of each payment or
prepayment of principal thereof and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans and C/D
Rate Loans, the length of each Interest Period with respect thereto, on the
schedule annexed to and constituting a part of its Note, and any such
recordation shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the
information so recorded; provided, that the failure of any Bank to make any
such recordation or any error in any such recordation shall not affect the
obligations of the Company hereunder or under such Note. Each Note shall (x)
be dated the Closing Date, (y) be stated to mature on the Termination Date and
(z) provide for the payment of interest in accordance with Section 2.9.

2.3 Procedure for Revolving Credit Borrowing. The Company may
borrow under the Commitments during the Commitment Period on any Eurodollar
Business Day, if all or any part of the requested Loans are to be initially
Eurodollar Loans, or on any Business Day, otherwise; provided, that the
Company shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice
must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York
City time, (a) with respect to any of the requested Loans that are to be
initially Eurodollar Loans, three Eurodollar Business Days prior to the
requested Borrowing Date, (b) with respect to any of the requested Loans that
are to be initially C/D Rate Loans, one Business Day prior to the requested
Borrowing Date, or (c) with respect to any of the requested Loans that are to
be initially Base Rate Loans, one Business Day prior to the requested
Borrowing Date; provided, that with respect to any of the requested Loans to
be made on the initial Borrowing Date as Base Rate Loans, notice for such
Loans may be given on such initial Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount
to be borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, (iii) whether the borrowing
is to be of Eurodollar Loans, Base Rate Loans, C/D Rate Loans or a combination 
thereof and (iv) if the borrowing is to be entirely or partly of Eurodollar
Loans or C/D Rate Loans, the respective amounts of each such Loan and the
respective lengths of the initial Interest Periods therefor. Each borrowing
under the Commitments shall be in an amount equal to $10,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or in the remaining amount of the
Available Commitments. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Company, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. Each Bank will
make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing available to the

<PAGE>22

Administrative Agent for the account of the Company at the office of the
Administrative Agent specified in Section 9.2 prior to 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on the Borrowing Date requested by the Company in funds immediately
available to the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made
available to the Company by the Administrative Agent's crediting the account
of the Company on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts
made available to the Administrative Agent by the Banks and in like funds as
received by the Administrative Agent.

2.4 Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a commitment fee for the
period from and including the Closing Date, computed at the Commitment Fee
Rate on the average daily amount of the Unused Commitment of such Bank during
the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears on the last
day of each March, June, September and December and on the Termination Date,
commencing on the first of such dates to occur after the date hereof.

(b) Upfront Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Bank an upfront fee equal to the applicable
Upfront Fee Percentage of the Commitment of such Bank in effect on the Closing
Date, payable on the Closing Date. The "Upfront Fee Percentage" shall be
based on the initial commitment of such Bank for this Agreement, as expressed
in writing by such Bank to the Company (and before final allocation of the
Commitments), in accordance with the following table:
Initial
Commitment (Before Upfront 
Final Allocation) Fee Percentage

$71,000,000 or more 0.07%
$53,250,000 to $70,999,999 0.06%
$35,500,000 to $53,249,999 0.05%
$17,750,000 to $35,499,999 0.04%
Less than $17,750,000, if any 0% 

(c) Other Fees. The Company agrees to pay to each Agent such other
fees as have been agreed to in writing by the Company and such Agent.

2.5 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Company shall
have the right, upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the Agent,
to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of
the Commitments; provided, that no such termination or reduction shall be
permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any payments or prepayments
of the Loans made on the effective date thereof, the aggregate principal
amount of the Loans then outstanding would exceed the aggregate Commitments
then in effect. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $10,000,000
or a whole multiple of

<PAGE>23

$1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the Commitments then
in effect. 

2.6 Prepayments. (a) The Company may at any time and from time to
time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon
at least three Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent
in the case of Base Rate Loans and C/D Rate Loans and at least three
Eurodollar Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent in
the case of Eurodollar Loans, which notice shall specify the date and amount
of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans, Base Rate
Loans, C/D Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination
thereof, the amount allocable to each. Upon receipt of any such notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. If any such
notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable
on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on
the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 
Each prepayment of Eurodollar Loans and C/D Rate Loans shall be subject to
compliance with the provisions of Sections 2.8 and 2.16.

(b) If at any time the principal amount of Loans then outstanding
shall exceed the Commitments, the Company shall immediately prepay or at its
option cash collateralize the Loans as provided in Section 2.6(c) in an amount
equal to such excess. Amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) shall
be applied, first, to prepay any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and second,
to prepay or cash collateralize (at the Company's option) any Eurodollar Loans
or C/D Rate Loans then outstanding (provided, that any Eurodollar Loans or C/D
Rate Loans so cash collateralized shall be prepaid no later than the last day
of the respective Interest Periods therefor). Each prepayment pursuant to
this Section 2.6(b) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount
prepaid and, in the case of prepayments of Eurodollar Loans, any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.16.

(c) The Company shall cash collateralize Eurodollar Loans or C/D
Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.6(b) by depositing in an account with the
Administrative Agent (the "Cash Collateral Account"), to be established and
maintained pursuant to such terms and conditions as shall be specified by the
Administrative Agent in its discretion, an amount determined pursuant to the
second sentence of Section 2.6(b) with respect to Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate
Loans, as the case may be. Such deposited monies shall be held by the
Administrative Agent as cash collateral (the "Cash Collateral") for the
outstanding Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans, as the case may be, on a pro
rata basis; provided, that if any Base Rate Loans shall be made while there is
Cash Collateral on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account, the Administrative
Agent shall apply such Cash Collateral to the immediate prepayment of such
Base Rate Loans and only the Cash

<PAGE>24

Collateral remaining after such prepayment, if any, shall be retained in the
Cash Collateral Account. The Cash Collateral Account and the Cash Collateral
shall be subject to the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent
and, except as set forth above, the Cash Collateral shall be retained in the
Cash Collateral Account until the repayment of Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate
Loans, as the case may be, in an amount equal to the amount of the Cash
Collateral deposited therein. Upon any such repayment, an amount equal to the
amount of such repayment shall be transferred from the Cash Collateral Account
to the Company. The Administrative Agent shall invest the Cash Collateral in
Cash Equivalents, and shall pay over to the Company any interest earned on
such investments quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and
December; provided, that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing (in which case such interest shall be retained as Cash
Collateral). The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any losses or
decreases in value with respect to the Cash Collateral, other than those
occurring as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

2.7 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Company may
elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans to Base 
Rate Loans, and/or to convert Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans to C/D Rate
Loans, by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election; provided, that any such conversion of
Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans may only be made on the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. The Company may elect from time to time
to convert Base Rate Loans or C/D Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the
Agent at least three Eurodollar Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of
such election; provided, that any such conversion of C/D Rate Loans may,
subject to the third succeeding sentence, only be made on the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. Any such notice of conversion to
Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans shall specify the length of the initial
Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice
the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof. If the last day of the
then current Interest Period with respect to C/D Rate Loans that are to be
converted to Eurodollar Loans is not a Eurodollar Business Day, such
conversion shall be made on the next succeeding Eurodollar Business Day, and
during the period from such last day to such succeeding Eurodollar Business
Day such Loans shall bear interest as if they were Base Rate Loans. All or
any part of outstanding Eurodollar Loans, Base Rate Loans and C/D Rate Loans
may be converted as provided herein; provided, that (i) no Loan may be
converted into a Eurodollar Loan or a C/D Rate Loan when any Event of Default
(upon notice from the Administration Agent, on behalf of the Required Banks,
except such notice shall not be required in the case of the Event of Default
described in Section 7(f)) has occurred and is continuing, (ii) any such
conversion may only be made if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.8 shall
not have been

<PAGE>25

contravened and (iii) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan or a C/D
Rate Loan after the date that is one month or 30 days, respectively, prior to
the Termination Date.

(b) Any Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate Loan may be continued as such
upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto
by the Company giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section
1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans;
provided, that no Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate Loan may be continued as such
(i) when any Event of Default (upon notice from the Administration Agent, on
behalf of the Required Banks, except such notice shall not be required in the
case of the Event of Default described in Section 7(f)) has occurred and is
continuing, (ii) if, after giving effect thereto, Section 2.8 would be
contravened or (iii) after the date that is one month or 30 days,
respectively, prior to the Termination Date; provided further, that if the
Company shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this
paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding
proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the
last day of such then expiring Interest Period.

2.8 Minimum Amounts of Tranches. All borrowings, conversions and
continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods
hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so
that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans
comprising (a) each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $15,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (b) each C/D Rate Tranche
shall be equal to $15,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and (c) there shall be no more than 12 different Tranches outstanding
at any one time.

2.9 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan
shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect
thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.

(b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

(c) Each C/D Rate Loan shall bear interest for each day during each
Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the C/D Rate
determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin.

(d) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan,
(ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any fee or other amount payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or

<PAGE>26

otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which
is (x) in the case of overdue principal, the rate that would otherwise be
applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9
plus 2%, (y) in the case of overdue interest (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) or fees, the rate described in paragraph (b) of this Section
2.9 plus 2% or (z) in the case of other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the then applicable Base Rate, in each case from the date of such
non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before
judgment).

(e) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date; provided, that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
Section 2.9 shall be payable on demand, or, in the absence of demand, weekly
on Friday of each week.

2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest on Loans and
fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days
elapsed; provided, that interest on Base Rate Loans computed with reference to
the Administrative Agent's reference rate shall be calculated on the basis of
a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. 
The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify in writing the
Company and the Banks of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate or of a C/D
Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in
the Ratings, the Base Rate, the C/D Assessment Rate or the C/D Reserve
Percentage and any change in the commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.4(a)
resulting from a change in the Commitment Fee Rate shall become effective as
of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. 
The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify in writing the
Company and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change
in interest rate.

(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company or a Bank, deliver
to the Company or such Bank, as the case may be, a statement showing the
quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate
pursuant to Section 2.9(a) or (c).

(c) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate or all its
Loans shall be assigned for any reason whatsoever or such Reference Bank shall
fail on two consecutive times to furnish quotations of the rate to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(d), such Reference Bank shall
thereupon cease to be a Reference Bank, and if, as a result of the foregoing,
there shall only be one Reference Bank remaining, the Administrative Agent
(after consultation with the Company and the Banks) shall, by notice to the
Company and the Banks, designate

<PAGE>27

another Bank as a Reference Bank so that there shall at all times be at least
two Reference Banks.

(d) Each Reference Bank shall use its best efforts to furnish
quotations of rates to the Administrative Agent as contemplated hereby. If
any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or shall otherwise fail to supply
such rates to the Administrative Agent upon its request, the rate of interest
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, be determined on the basis
of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks or Reference Bank.

2.11 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. In the event that prior
to the first day of any Interest Period:

(a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company) that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate or the
C/D Rate for such Interest Period, or

(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Required Banks that the Eurodollar Rate or the C/D Rate determined or to
be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Banks (as conclusively certified in writing by
such Banks) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such
Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice (confirmed
in writing) thereof to the Company and the Banks as soon as practicable
thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate
Loans, as the case may be, requested to be made on the first day of such
Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (y) any Loans that were to
have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar
Loans or C/D Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be converted to or
continued as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans or C/D
Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be converted, on the first day of such
Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Company at such time as the conditions set forth in (a) and (b)
above are no longer in effect, and until such notice has been delivered by the
Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans shall be
made or continued as such, nor shall the Company have the right to convert
Loans to Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans, as the case may be.

2.12 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing by the
Company from the Banks of Loans, each payment by the Company on account of any
commitment fee or upfront fee hereunder and any reduction of the Commitments
of the Banks shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment

<PAGE>28

Percentages of the Banks. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the
Company on account of principal of and interest on the Loans shall be made pro
rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans
then held by the Banks. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by
the Company hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal,
interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and
shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof
to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Banks, at the
Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 9.2, in Dollars and in
immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payments to the Banks promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any
payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due
and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of
principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate 
during such extension. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Eurodollar Business Day, the maturity thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Eurodollar Business Day unless the
result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar
month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding
Eurodollar Business Day.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by any Bank prior to a Borrowing Date that such Bank will not make the
amount that would constitute its portion of the borrowing to be made on such
date available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Bank has made such amount available to the Administrative
Agent on such Borrowing Date, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. 
If such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after
such Borrowing Date, such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand
an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal funds rate
during such period as quoted by the Administrative Agent, times (ii) the
amount of such Bank's portion of such borrowing, times (iii) a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such
Borrowing Date to the date on which such Bank's portion of such borrowing
shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the
denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent
submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this Section
2.12(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank's
portion of such borrowing is not in fact made available to the Administrative
Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest
thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder, on
demand, from the Company. If the Company returns to the Administrative Agent
any amount with

<PAGE>29

interest thereon as described in the immediately preceding sentence, such Bank
shall indemnify the Company for the difference, if any, between (i) the
aggregate interest paid by the Company to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence less (ii) the aggregate
interest which actually accrued on such amount prior to its return to the
Administrative Agent.

2.13 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Bank
hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and
convert Domestic Dollar Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be cancelled
and (b) such Bank's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall
be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of
the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such
earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest
Period with respect thereto, the Company shall pay to such Bank such amounts,
if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.16.

2.14 Other Costs; Increased Costs. (a) The Company agrees to pay
to each Bank which requests compensation under this Section 2.14(a) (by
written notice to the Company), on the last day of each Interest Period with
respect to any Eurodollar Loan made by such Bank, so long as such Bank shall
be required to maintain reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under
Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or, so
long as such Bank may be required by such Board of Governors or by any other
Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against any category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any 
category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes
any Eurodollar Loans), an additional amount (determined by such Bank and
notified to the Company) representing such Bank's calculation or, if an
accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate (using such
reasonable means of allocation as such Bank shall determine) of the actual
costs, if any, incurred by such Bank while such Eurodollar Loans were
outstanding as a result of the applicability of the foregoing reserves to such
Eurodollar Loans, which amount in any event shall not exceed the product of
the following for each day while such Eurodollar Loans were outstanding:

(i) the principal amount of the relevant Eurodollar Loans made by
such Bank outstanding on such day; and

<PAGE>30

(ii) the difference between (x) a fraction the numerator of which is
the Eurodollar Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such
Eurodollar Loans, and the denominator of which is one minus the maximum
rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are
imposed by such Board of Governors or other Governmental Authority on
such date minus (y) such numerator; and

(iii) a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of
which is 360.

(b) In the event that any change in any Requirement of Law or in
the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

(i) shall subject any Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever with
respect to this Agreement, any Note or any Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate
Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Bank
in respect thereof (except for taxes covered by Section 2.15 and changes
in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank);

(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans
or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
any office of such Bank which is not otherwise described in Section
2.14(a) or otherwise included in the determination of the C/D Rate; or

(iii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank,
by an amount which such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans or to reduce any
amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the
Company shall pay such Bank within 15 Business Days following demand therefor
any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such increased
cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14(b), it shall promptly notify
the Company, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which
it has become so entitled. 

(c) In the event that any Bank shall have determined that any
change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Bank or any
corporation controlling such Bank with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether

<PAGE>31

or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made
subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital as a consequence
of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank or such
corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to
capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from
time to time, after submission by such Bank to the Company (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Company shall pay to
such Bank within 15 Business Days following demand therefor such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.

(d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.14 submitted by the relevant Bank, through the Administrative
Agent, to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
The covenants contained in this Section 2.14 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder. Any notice to be given by a Bank under this Section 2.14 after
termination of this Agreement shall be effective only if given within 120 days
after such Bank becomes aware or should have become aware of the events giving
rise to such notice.

2.15 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Company under this
Agreement and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority, excluding, in the case of each Agent and each Bank,
(i) net income taxes, franchise and branch profit taxes (imposed in lieu of
net income taxes) imposed on such Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, as a
result of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction of the
government or taxing authority imposing such tax and such Agent or such Bank
(excluding a connection arising solely from such Agent or such Bank having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under,
or enforced, this Agreement or the Notes) or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein and (ii) any taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings arising after the Closing
Date, solely as a result of or attributable to such Agent or Bank (x) changing
its designated lending office as of the Closing Date to a lending office
located in any other jurisdiction or (y) designating an additional lending
office located in any other jurisdiction (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions and withholdings being hereinafter
called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts
payable to any Agent or any Bank hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts so
payable to such

<PAGE>32

Agent or such Bank shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such
Agent or such Bank (after payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other
amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this
Agreement and the Notes. Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Company, as
promptly as possible thereafter the Company shall send to the Administrative
Agent for its own account or for the account of such Agent or Bank, as the
case may be, a copy of any original official receipt that may be received by
the Company showing payment thereof. If the Company fails to pay any Taxes
when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the
Administrative Agent the receipts that may be received or other available
documentary evidence, the Company shall indemnify the Agents and the Banks for
any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any
Agent or any Bank to the United States or other Governmental Authority as a
result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section 2.15(a) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder. If any Taxes constituting a withholding tax 
of the United States of America or any other Governmental Authority shall be
or become applicable, after the Closing Date, to such payments by the Company
to an Agent or Bank, such Agent or Bank shall use its best efforts to make,
fund and maintain its Loans through another lending office of such Agent or
Bank in another jurisdiction so as to reduce, to the fullest extent possible,
the Company's liability hereunder, if the making, funding or maintenance of
such Loans through such other office does not otherwise materially adversely
affect such Loans or such Agent or Bank.

(b) Prior to the first Interest Payment Date, each Bank that is not
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof
agrees that it will deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (i)
two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
or 4224 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, and (ii) an Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor applicable form. Each such Bank
also agrees to deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent two further
copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor
applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or
before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously
delivered by it to the Company, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may
reasonably be requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, unless in
any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty,
law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery
would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Bank so advises the Company and the Administrative
Agent. Such Bank shall certify (i) in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224, that
it is entitled to receive

<PAGE>33

payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it
is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. The
Company shall not be required to pay any increased amount on account of Taxes
pursuant to this Section 2.15 to an Agent or Bank that fails to furnish any
form or statement that it is required to furnish in accordance with this
Section 2.15(b) and, to the extent required by law, the Company shall be
entitled to deduct Taxes from the payments owed to such Bank or Agent. In the
event that the Company is required to pay any Bank any additional amount or
indemnify any Bank pursuant to Section 2.15(a) and no change in lending office
is made in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.15(a), after the
Company makes such payment, such Bank shall transfer, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 9.6(c), its Loans and Commitment to a Bank
selected by the Company with the approval of such transferor Bank and the
Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

2.16 Indemnity. The Company agrees to indemnify each Bank and to
hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which such Bank may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Company in payment when due of
the principal amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan or C/D Rate Loan,
(b) default by the Company in making a borrowing of, conversion into or
continuation of Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans after the Company has given
a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (c) default by the Company in making any prepayment after the
Company has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (d) the making of a voluntary or involuntary prepayment of
Eurodollar Loans or C/D Rate Loans on a day which is not the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto or (e) the conversion of Eurodollar Loans
to Domestic Dollar Loans pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.13 on a day which is
not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, including,
without limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the
reemployment of funds obtained by it or from fees payable to terminate the
deposits from which such funds were obtained. A certificate setting forth the 
computation of any amount payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted
by a Bank, through the Administrative Agent, to the Company shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

2.17 Purpose. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used by the
Company solely for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions
(including the acquisition of Federal Systems).

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 

In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement and to
make the Loans herein provided for, the Company hereby represents and warrants
to each Agent and to each Bank that: 

3.1 Financial Condition. (a) The consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as at March 31, 1993 and the related
consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and of cash flows for
the fiscal year ended on such date, reported on by Coopers & Lybrand and (b)
the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as at December 31, 1993 and the related unaudited consolidated statements of
income and retained earnings and of cash flows for the fiscal quarter ended on
such date, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Bank, are
complete and correct in all material respects and present fairly (except, with
respect to interim reports, for normal year-end adjustments) the consolidated
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and
the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the fiscal
period then ended. All such financial statements, including the related
schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by
such accountants and as disclosed therein). Except as disclosed on Schedule
3.1 hereto, such audited financial statements, taken together, disclose, in
accordance with GAAP, all material contingent liabilities and liability for
taxes, long-term leases and unusual forward or long-term commitments of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. 

3.2 No Change. Since March 31, 1993 (a) there has been no change
in the business, operations, property or financial or other condition of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which has or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) no dividends or other distributions
have been declared, paid or made upon any shares of capital stock of the
Company nor have any shares of capital stock of the Company been redeemed,
retired, purchased or otherwise acquired for value by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries except as permitted by Section 6.5.

3.3 Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each of the Company
and the Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, (b) has the corporate power and authority and the legal right to
own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and
to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that
the failure to be

<PAGE>35

so qualified could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law 
except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

3.4 Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The
Company has the corporate power and authority and the legal right to make,
deliver and perform this Agreement and the Notes and to borrow hereunder and
has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the borrowings on the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Notes and to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Notes. No
consent or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in respect of any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder
or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of
this Agreement and the Notes, other than those which have been obtained or
made and are in full force and effect. This Agreement has been, and each Note
will be, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company. This Agreement
constitutes, and each Note when executed and delivered will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity
or at law).

3.5 No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Notes by the Company, the borrowings hereunder and the use
of the proceeds thereof, will not violate any Requirement of Law or any
Contractual Obligation applicable to the Company or of any of the
Subsidiaries, and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any of its or their respective properties or revenues pursuant
to any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation.

3.6 No Material Litigation. No litigation, investigation or
proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by or against the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties
or revenues (a) with respect to this Agreement and the Notes or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, excluding litigation described in the
Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1993 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (but not excluding developments with
respect thereto occurring after March 31, 1993 not described in such Form 10-
K).

<PAGE>36

3.7 No Default. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is
in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

3.8 Ownership of Property; Liens. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries has good record and marketable title in fee simple to or valid
leasehold interests in all its real property, and good title to all its other
property, and none of such property is subject to any Lien, except as
permitted in Section 6.3 and except where the failure to have such title could
not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

3.9 Taxes. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has filed or
caused to be filed all tax returns which to the knowledge of the Company are
required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on
said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and
all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by
any Governmental Authority (other than those the amount or validity of which

is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the
books of the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and other than
those the non-payment of which could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect); and no federal income tax liens
have been filed and, to the knowledge of the Company, no claims are being
asserted with respect to any such taxes, fees or other charges, except any
such claims which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

3.10 Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loans
hereunder will be used for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any
"margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms
under Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as
now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose which
violates the provisions of the Regulations of such Board of Governors. If
requested by any Bank or the Administrative Agent, the Company will furnish to
the Administrative Agent and each Bank a statement to the foregoing effect in
conformity with the requirements of Federal Reserve Form U-1 referred to in
said Regulation U.

3.11 ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which
this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan which has
resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a liability to the
Company or any Substantial Subsidiary in excess of

<PAGE>37

$2,000,000, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single
Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has
arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued
benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to
fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the
date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed, by more than
$35,000,000, the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued
benefits; provided, however, that with respect to the defined benefit pension
plan to be established by Federal Systems, such amount shall be $50,000,000
rather than $35,000,000. Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled
Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan,
and neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become
subject to any liability under ERISA if the Company or any such Commonly
Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as
of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, where such liability could, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No such
Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.

3.12 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. The Company is not
an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Company is not subject to regulation under any Federal or State statute or
regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

3.13 Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.13, the
Subsidiaries listed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal
year ended March 31, 1993 constitute all of the Subsidiaries of the Company on
the Effective Date.

3.14 Environmental Matters. Each of the representations and
warranties set forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this Section 3.14 is
true and correct with respect to each parcel of real property owned or
operated by the Company or any Subsidiary (the "Properties"), except to the 
extent that (i) the facts and circumstances giving rise to any such failure to
be so true and correct could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) the Company and the Subsidiaries are fully indemnified
against any liabilities which may result from any such failure to be so true
and correct:

(a) The Properties do not contain, and have not previously
contained, in, on, or under, including, without limitation, the soil and
groundwater thereunder, any Hazardous Materials in concentrations which
violate Environmental Laws.

<PAGE>38

(b) The Properties and all operations and facilities at the
Properties are in compliance with all Environmental Laws, and there is no
Hazardous Materials contamination or violation of any Environmental Law
which could interfere with the continued operation of any of the
Properties or impair the fair saleable value of any thereof.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received
any written complaint, notice of violation, alleged violation,
investigation or advisory action or of potential liability or of
potential responsibility regarding environmental protection matters or
permit compliance with regard to the Properties, nor is the Company aware
that any Governmental Authority is threatening to deliver to the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries any such notice.

(d) Hazardous Materials have not been generated, treated, stored,
disposed of, at, on or under any of the Properties, nor have any
Hazardous Materials been transferred from the Properties to any other
location in violation of any Environmental Law.

(e) There are no governmental, administrative actions or judicial
proceedings pending or (to the knowledge of the Company) contemplated
under any Environmental Laws to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is or (to the knowledge of the Company) will be named as a
party with respect to the Properties, nor are there any consent decrees
or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or other orders,
or other administrative or judicial requirements outstanding under any
Environmental Law with respect to any of the Properties. 

3.15 Full Disclosure. All information heretofore furnished by the
Company to any Agent or any Bank for purposes of or in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby is, and all such information
hereafter furnished by the Company to any Agent or any Bank will be, true and
accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such information is
stated or certified. The Company has disclosed to the Banks in writing any
and all facts which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

SECTION 8. THE AGENTS

8.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates Morgan as
the Documentation Agent of such Bank under this Agreement and each such Bank
irrevocably authorizes Morgan, as the Documentation Agent for such Bank, to
take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Documentation Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank hereby irrevocably
designates and appoints Chemical as the Administrative Agent of such Bank
under this Agreement, and each such Bank irrevocably authorizes Chemical, as
the

<PAGE>56

Administrative Agent for such Bank, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such powers and perform such
duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of
this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each of
Barclays and Continental as an Agent of such Bank under this Agreement, and
each such Bank irrevocably authorizes each of Barclays and Continental, as an
Agent for such Bank, to take action on its behalf under this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly 
set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agents.

8.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agents may execute any of their
duties under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Agents shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by any of them with
reasonable care.

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i)
liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such
Person under or in connection with this Agreement (except for its or such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in
any manner to any of the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations
or warranties made by the Company or any officer thereof contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred
to or provided for in, or received by such Agent under or in connection with,
this Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or the Notes or for any
failure of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as
to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or
conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or records
of the Company.

8.4 Reliance by Agents. The Agents shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram,
telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or
conversation believed by them to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the
Company), independent accountants and other

<PAGE>57

experts selected by the Agents. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat
the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written
notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed
with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks
as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction
by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred
by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the Notes in accordance with
a request of the Required Banks, and such request and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all
future holders of the Notes.

8.5 Notice of Default. The Agents shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank or
the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event
that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
reasonably directed by the Required Banks; provided, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from 
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks.

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Banks. Each Bank expressly
acknowledges that no Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Company, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by such Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to
the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
the Company and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter
into this Agreement. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently
and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Bank, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue
to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and/or decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations,

<PAGE>58

property, financial and/or other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required
to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent
shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or
other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and
other condition or creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the
possession of such Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

8.7 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify each Agent in
its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company and without
limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably according to their
respective Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including without limitation at any time following the payment of the Notes)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken
or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from such Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. If any such amount with respect to
which the Banks have indemnified such Agent is recovered from the Company,
such Agent shall return the amount so recovered to the Banks which so
indemnified such Agent, but without interest, unless the Company has paid
interest. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the
Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder. 

8.8 Each Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Company as though such Agent were not an Agent
hereunder. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note
issued to it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an
Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include each Agent in its
individual capacity. Each Bank and Transferee acknowledges that each of
Morgan, Chemical, Barclays and Continental is an agent and a lender under the
364-Day Credit Agreement. 

8.9 Successor Agents. An Agent may resign as such upon 10 days'
notice to the Banks and the Company; provided, that such resignation shall not
become effective until a successor Agent is appointed in accordance with this
Section 8.9. If such Agent shall resign as an Agent under this Agreement,
then the

<PAGE>59

Required Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the
Banks which successor agent shall be approved by the Company, whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such Agent,
and any references to such Agent herein or in the Notes shall mean such
successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights,
powers and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or further
act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the Notes. After any retiring Agent's resignation
as such, the provisions of this Section 8.9 shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under
this Agreement.

SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS

9.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement, any Note, nor
any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1. With the written consent
of the Required Banks, the Documentation Agent, on behalf of the Banks and the
Agents, and the Company may, from time to time, enter into written amendments,
supplements or modifications hereto and to the Notes for the purpose of adding
any provisions to this Agreement or the Notes or changing in any manner the
rights of the Banks or of the Company hereunder or thereunder or waiving, on
such terms and conditions as the Documentation Agent may specify in such
instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the Notes or any
Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no
such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (a) reduce
the amount or extend the scheduled maturity of any Note, or reduce the rate or
extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any fee payable to
any Bank hereunder, or reduce the principal amount of any Note, or change the
amount of any Bank's Commitment, in each case without the written consent of
each Bank affected thereby, or (b) amend, modify or waive any provision of
this Section 9.1, or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Banks, or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Company of any
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or release amounts in the
Cash Collateral Account other than in accordance with Section 2.6 in each case
without the written consent of all the Banks, or (c) amend, modify or waive
any provision of Section 8 without the written consent of the then Agents. 
Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply
equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon the Company, the Banks,
the Agents and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver,
the Company, the Banks and the Agents shall be restored to their former
position and rights hereunder and under the outstanding Notes, and any Default
or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but
no such

<PAGE>60

waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or
impair any right consequent thereon.

which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
execution and delivery of, or consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any
waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the Notes and any

Agents (and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents)
harmless from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to or arising out
of the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, syndication and
administration of this Agreement, the Notes and any such other documents and
the use of proceeds of the Loans (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"indemnified liabilities"); provided, that the Company shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Agent or any Bank with respect to indemnified
liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
such Agent or any such Bank. The agreements in this Section 9.5 shall survive
repayment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

9.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Banks. (a) 
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company,
the Banks, the Agents, all future holders of the Notes, and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign or transfer any 
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of each Bank.

(b) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or
more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any
Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held by such Bank, the Commitment of such
Bank or any other interest of such Bank hereunder; provided, that if the
Participant is not an Affiliate of such Bank or another Bank, such Bank shall
obtain the prior consent of the Company to such sale of participating
interests (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and
provided further, that such Bank shall reserve solely unto itself, and shall
not grant to any Participant, any part or all of its right to agree to the
amendment, modification or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement, its
Note or any document related thereto, except to

<PAGE>63

the extent that such amendment, modification or waiver would reduce the
principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone the date of the
final maturity of, or any date fixed for any payment of interest on, the
Notes, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. In the event
of any such sale by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, such
Bank's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for
all purposes under this Agreement and the Company, the Documentation Agent,
and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. The Company agrees that if amounts outstanding under this
Agreement and the Notes are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or
shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and any Note to
the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement or any Note; provided, that such
right of setoff shall be subject to the obligation of such Participant to
share with the Banks, and the Banks agree to share with such Participant, as
provided in Section 9.7. The Company also agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.5 with respect
to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to
time; provided, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater
amount pursuant to such Sections than the transferor Bank would have been
entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred
by such transferor Bank to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

(c) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, and (if the Purchasing Bank is
not an Affiliate of such Bank or an existing Bank) with the prior consent of
the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), at any time
sell to one or more banks or financial institutions ("Purchasing Banks") all
or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes,
pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Bank
and such transferor Bank, and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its
acceptance and recording in the Register; provided, that if the Purchasing
Bank is not an Affiliate of such Bank or an existing Bank any sale of Loans
shall be in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) such Bank's Commitment and
(ii) $15,000,000; and provided, further, that no Bank may sell any part of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes to a Purchasing Bank
unless a ratable share of its rights and obligations under the 364-Day Credit
Agreement are simultaneously sold to such Purchasing Bank. Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and

<PAGE>64

recording, from and after the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to
such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Bank thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder with a
Commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the transferor Bank thereunder shall,
to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of a Commitment
Transfer Supplement covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Bank shall
cease to be a party hereto). Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be
deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent,
necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the resulting
adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such
Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such
transferor Bank under this Agreement and the Notes. On or prior to the
Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, the Company, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the
order of such Purchasing Bank in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by
it pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement and, if the transferor Bank
has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the transferor
Bank in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new
Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of
the Notes replaced thereby. The Note surrendered by the transferor Bank shall
be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Company marked "cancelled".

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred
to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to
it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Company, the
Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Company or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. 

(e) Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed
by a transferor Bank and a Purchasing Bank together with payment to the
Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $4,000, the
Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Commitment Transfer
Supplement and (ii) on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto
record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of
such acceptance and recordation to the Documentation Agent, the Banks and the
Company. 

<PAGE>65

(f) The Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant
or Purchasing Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any
and all financial information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company
and its affiliates which has been delivered to such Bank by or on behalf of
the Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such
Bank by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such Bank's credit
evaluation of the Company and its affiliates prior to becoming a party to this
Agreement; provided, that such Transferee or prospective Transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section
9.14 hereof.

(g) If, pursuant to this Section 9.6, any interest in this
Agreement or any Note is transferred to any Transferee which is organized
under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State
thereof, the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with 
the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to the transferor Bank
(for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Agents and the Company) that
under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to be withheld by
the Administrative Agent, the Company or the transferor Bank with respect to
any payments to be made to such Transferee in respect of the Loans, (ii) to
furnish to the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank
registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Company) either
U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form
1001 (wherein such Transferee claims entitlement to complete exemption from
U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder) and an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor applicable form (wherein
such Transferee claims exemption from United States backup withholding tax)
and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Agents and the
Company) to provide the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing
Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent and the Company) a
new Form 4224 or 1001 or Form W-8 or W-9 upon the expiration or obsolescence
of any previously delivered form and comparable statements in accordance with
applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments duly executed and
completed by such Transferee, and to comply from time to time with all
applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such withholding and
backup withholding tax exemptions.

(h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Bank from pledging or
assigning any Note to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable
law.

9.7 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank")
shall receive any payment of all or part of its Loans or interest thereon, or
receive any collateral in respect of its Loans (in each case whether
voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of
the nature referred to in clause (f) of Section 7, or otherwise)

<PAGE>66

in a greater proportion than any such payment to and collateral received by
any other Bank, if any, in respect of such other Bank's Loans or interest
thereon, or Loans or interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for
cash from the other Banks such portion of each such other Bank's Loans, or
shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral, or
the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Bank to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably
with each of the Banks; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Bank,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits
returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Company
agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's Loans may
exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-
off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct
holder of such portion.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by
law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the Company, any
such notice being expressly waived by the Company to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Company
hereunder or under the Notes (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise) to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in
any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency,
in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or
unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the
account of the Company. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and
the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
Bank; provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. 

9.8 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts and all
of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with the Company and the Agent.

it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding
referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or
consequential damages.

9.12 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION
OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM

CREDIT AGREEMENT

[FORM OF OPINION OF WILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER]

February 23, 1994

To the Banks listed on Schedule I
hereto and to the Agents
referred to below

Dear Sirs:

We have acted as counsel to Loral Corporation (the "Company") in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the
following documents:

(a) the Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 1994 (the
"Credit Agreement") among the Company, the banks from time to time party
thereto (the "Banks"), Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as
documentation agent for the Banks (the "Documentation Agent"), Chemical
Bank, as administrative agent for the Banks (the "Administrative Agent"),
and Barclays Bank PLC and Continental Bank, N.A., as agents for the Banks
(along with the Administrative Agent and the Documentation Agent, the
"Agents"); and

(b) the Notes of the Company, dated the date hereof (the "Notes").

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.1(b) of the
Credit Agreement. Terms used herein which are defined in the Credit Agreement
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement, unless
otherwise defined herein.

In connection with this opinion, we have made such examinations of law
and inquiries of officers of the Company and have examined certificates of
public officials, execution copies of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and
such corporate documents and records of the Company and certificates of public
officials and officers of the Company, and such other documents, as we have
deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In such
examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity
of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to authentic
original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or
photostatic copies. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion,
we have relied upon the certifications, 

<PAGE>97

representations and warranties of officers and representatives of the Company
and upon the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Credit Agreement.

As used herein, "Indentures" is the collective reference to the 9-1/8%
Indenture, the 7% Indenture and the 8-3/8% Indenture.

A. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Company (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) has the
corporate power and authority to own and operate its property and to conduct its
business in the manner in which it is currently conducted, and (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of New
York, Arizona, California, Washington, D.C., Florida, Maryland, Ohio and
Virginia.

2. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute, make
and deliver the Credit Agreement and the Notes and to borrow and perform its
obligations under the Credit Agreement and Notes. The Company has taken all
necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the borrowings contemplated by the
Credit Agreement. No consent or authorization of, or filing with, any person
pursuant to the Indentures or any Governmental Authority, is required by the
Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes
and the borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement except for filings which
are contemplated by the Credit Agreement, and filings of UCC financing
statements, if any, necessary in connection with the cash collateralization
contemplated by Section 2.6 of the Credit Agreement.

3. The Credit Agreement and Notes have been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Company. Each of the Credit Agreement and the Notes
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except as
provided in paragraph B hereof (other than paragraph B(3)) and except that we 
express no opinion as to the enforceability of the last sentence of Section 
9.7(a) or Section 9.7(b), to the extent that it purports to grant to any Bank 
set-off rights with respect to any amounts owed by the Company under the Credit
Agreement or the Notes to any other Bank, and no opinion is expressed as to the
enforceability of Section 2.9(d) to the extent it purports to specify the rate
of interest payable after judgment, or as to any indemnity provision which
includes indemnities for environmental matters to the extent the same conflicts
with Section 107(e) of CERCLA or any comparable provision of laws of the State
of New York.

<PAGE>98

4. Subject to the qualifications set forth in this paragraph, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement and
the Notes and the borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement will not
violate the restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, any
law, rule or regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America
or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any judgment, decree
or order known to us of any court or governmental or regulatory authority (each
of which is an "Order of Law") or any provision of the Indentures and will not
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the properties or
revenues of the Company pursuant to any such Order of Law or any provision of
the Indentures. We express no opinion, however, as to any law, rule or
regulation (i) the existence or absence of which does not have any material
adverse effect on the Agents or the Banks and does not deprive the Agents or 
the Banks of any material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes, 
(ii) which violation or Lien can be readily cured without significant delay or
expense to the Agents or the Banks, without loss to the Agents or the Banks of
any material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and without any
material adverse effect on the Agents or the Banks during the period of such
violation or Lien, or (iii) any violation of law, rule or regulation which
results from the status of the Agents or the Banks or facts relating
specifically to the Agents or the Banks.

5. To the best of our knowledge, except as may be described in the
Credit Agreement or in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
1993, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority is pending or threatened by or against the Company or any
Subsidiary or against any of their respective properties or revenues (a) with
respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes, or the performance by the Company
of its obligations thereunder, or (b) which, we have been advised by the
officers of the Company, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, property or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

6. The Company is not an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

B. The opinions expressed herein, however, are subject
to the following:

1. We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and do not
purport to be experts in the laws of jurisdictions other than the State of New
York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws
of the United States of America and we do not express any opinion as to the laws
of any jurisdiction other than the present laws of the State of New York, the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and

<PAGE>99

federal laws of the United States, in each case of the type typically applicable
to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement and the Notes,
and the present judicial interpretations thereof and to the facts as they
presently exist.

2. The opinions set forth in Paragraph A, insofar as they relate to
the enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, are subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to
equitable principles affecting the availability of equitable relief (regardless
of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),
including principles of commercial reasonableness or conscionability and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Such principles of equity are
of general application, and in applying such principles, a court, among other
things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate the maturity of a debt for an
immaterial default. Such principles applied by a court might include a
requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and good faith. Such
requirement might be applied, for example, to any provision of the Credit
Agreement and the Notes purporting to authorize conclusive determinations by any
Bank or any Agent. Insofar as provisions contained in the Credit Agreement
provide for indemnification, the enforcement thereof may be limited by public
policy considerations.

3. We have made no independent investigations except as specifically
set forth herein.

4. We express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any Bank or any Agent (or
any assignee of any of the rights and/or obligations of any Bank or any Agent 
under the Credit Agreement and the Notes) may be located or wherein enforcement
of the Credit Agreement and the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of
interest legally chargeable or collectible.

5. We express no opinion as to (i) whether a Federal or state court
outside of the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New York law
provided for in the Credit Agreement and the Notes, (ii) sections of the Credit
Agreement insofar as such sections relate to the subject matter jurisdiction of
the courts specified therein to adjudicate any controversy related to such
Credit Agreement and the Notes, (iii) sections of the Credit Agreement insofar
as such sections relate to the waiver of trial by jury or (iv) the waiver of
defenses and the waiver of objection to venue set forth in the Credit Agreement
with respect to proceedings in the courts specified therein.

6. We have assumed that all parties other than the Company have duly
authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>100

7. We have assumed that you, as well as all other parties other than
the Company, have all requisite corporate power and authority and have taken all
necessary action to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Credit
Agreement.

8. This opinion has been issued solely for the benefit of the Agents
and the Banks and no one else has the right to rely upon it. We further advise
you that we are not assuming any obligation to notify the Agents or the Banks of
any changes in this opinion as a result of any facts that may come to our
attention in the future which may cause a change in this opinion.

9. This opinion is limited to matters expressly set forth herein and
no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly
stated herein.

Very truly yours,

WILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER

EXHIBIT B-2 
TO REVOLVING 
CREDIT AGREEMENT

[FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL]

February 23, 1994

To the Banks listed on Schedule I
hereto and to the Agents
referred to below

Dear Sirs:

I am Vice President, Assistant Secretary and General Counsel of Loral
Corporation (the "Company") and have acted as such in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the following documents:

(a) the Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 1994 (the
"Credit Agreement") among the Company, the banks from time to time party
thereto (the "Banks"), Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as
documentation agent for the Banks (the "Documentation Agent"), Chemical
Bank, as administrative agent for the Banks (the "Administrative Agent"),
and Barclays Bank PLC and Continental Bank, N.A., as agents for the Banks
(along with the Administrative Agent and the Documentation Agent, the
"Agents"); and

(b) the Notes of the Company, dated the date hereof (the "Notes").

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.1(b) of the
Credit Agreement. Terms used herein which are defined in the Credit Agreement
shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement, unless
otherwise defined herein.

In connection with this opinion, I have made such examinations of law
and have examined executed copies of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and such
corporate documents and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certificates of public officials and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and such other documents, as I have deemed necessary or
appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In such examination, I have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic original documents
of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or

<PAGE>102

photostatic copies. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion, I
have relied upon certifications of officers and representatives of the Company
and upon the representations of the Company set forth in the Credit Agreement.

A. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion
that:

1. Each of the Company and each Subsidiary (a) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation, (b) has the corporate power and authority to own and
operate its property and to conduct its business in the manner in which it
proposes to do so, and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and
in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership of
property or the conduct or proposed conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except to the extent that the failure to so qualify could
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations, property or financial or other condition of the
Company.

2. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute,
make and deliver the Credit Agreement and the Notes and to borrow and
perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and Notes. The Company
has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the
borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement.

3. The Credit Agreement and Notes have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company. Each of the Credit Agreement and
the Notes constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms,
except as provided in paragraph B hereof and except that I express no
opinion as to the enforceability of the last sentence of Section 9.7(a) or
Section 9.7(b), to the extent that it purports to grant to any Bank set-off
rights with respect to any amounts owed by the Company under the Credit
Agreement or the Notes to any other Bank, and no opinion is expressed as to
the enforceability of Section 2.9(d) to the extent it purports to specify
the rate of interest payable after judgment, or as to any indemnity
provision which includes indemnities for environmental matters to the
extent the same conflicts with Section 107(e)

<PAGE>103

of CERCLA or any comparable provision of laws of the State of New York.

4. No consent or authorization of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority or any other Person is required by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance,
validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the
borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement, except for filings which
are contemplated by the Credit Agreement, and filings of UCC financing
statements, if any, necessary in connection with the cash collateralization
contemplated by Section 2.6 of the Credit Agreement. I express no opinion,
however, as to any such consent, authorization, filing or act (i) the
existence or absence of which does not have any material adverse effect on
the Agents or the Banks and does not deprive the Agents or the Banks of any
material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes or (ii) which can
be readily cured or obtained without significant delay or expense to the
Agents or the Banks, without loss to the Agents or the Banks of any
material benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes and without any
material adverse effect on the Agents or the Banks during the period in
which such consent, authorization, filing or act was not obtained or
effected.

5. Subject to the qualifications set forth in this paragraph, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement
and the Notes and the borrowings contemplated by the Credit Agreement will
not violate the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, any law, rule or
regulation of the State of New York or the United States of America or the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any judgment, decree or
order known to me of any court or governmental or regulatory authority
(each of which is an "Order of Law") or any Contractual Obligation of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and will not result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues 
pursuant to any such Order of Law or Contractual Obligation. I express no
opinion, however, as to any law, rule or regulation (i) the existence or
absence of which does not have any material adverse effect on the Agents or
the Banks and does not deprive the Agents or the Banks of any material
benefit under the Credit Agreement and the Notes, (ii) which violation or
Lien can be readily cured without significant delay or expense to the
Agents or the Banks, without loss to

<PAGE>104

the Agents or the Banks of any material benefit under the Credit Agreement
and the Notes and without any material adverse effect on the Agents or the
Banks during the period of such violation or Lien, or (iii) any violation
of law, rule or regulation which results from the Agents' or the Banks'
status or facts relating specifically to the Agents or the Banks.

6. To the best of my knowledge, except as may be described in the
Credit Agreement or in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
1993, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or threatened by or against
the Company or any Subsidiary or against any of its respective properties
or revenues (a) with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes, or the
performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, or (b) which
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, property or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

B. The opinions expressed herein, however, are subject to the
following:

1. I am a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia and do not
purport to be an expert in the laws of jurisdictions other than the
District of Columbia, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
and the Federal laws of the United States of America and I do not express
any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the present laws
of the District of Columbia, the State of New York (subject to the
qualification stated below), the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and federal laws of the United States, in each case of the type
typically applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit
Agreement and the Notes, and the present judicial interpretations thereof
and to the facts as they presently exist. I am not admitted to the Bar of
the State of New York. As to any opinion as to the laws of the State of
New York, I have relied solely on the opinion dated today, a copy of which
is being delivered to you, of Michael B. Targoff, Esq., Senior Vice
President, Secretary and former General Counsel of the Company.

2. The opinions set forth in Paragraph A, insofar as they relate to
the enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, are subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws

<PAGE>105

affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to
equitable principles affecting the availability of equitable relief
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law), including principles of commercial reasonableness or
conscionability and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
Such principles of equity are of general application, and in applying such
principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to
accelerate the maturity of a debt for an immaterial default. Such
principles applied by a court might include a requirement that a creditor
act with reasonableness and good faith. Such requirement might be applied,
for example, to any provision of the Credit Agreement and the Notes
purporting to authorize conclusive determinations by any Bank or any 
Agent. Insofar as provisions contained in the Credit Agreement provide for
indemnification, the enforcement thereof may be limited by public policy
considerations.

3. I express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any Bank or any Agent
(or any assignee of any of the rights and/or obligations of any Bank or any
Agent under the Credit Agreement and the Notes) may be located or wherein
enforcement of the Credit Agreement and the Notes may be sought which
limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.

4. I express no opinion as to (i) whether a Federal or state court
outside of the State of New York would give effect to the choice of New
York law provided for in the Credit Agreement and the Notes, (ii) sections
of the Credit Agreement and the Notes insofar as such sections relate to
the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts specified therein to
adjudicate any controversy related to such Credit Agreement and the Notes,
(iii) sections of the Credit Agreement insofar as such sections relate to
the waiver of trial by jury or (iv) the waiver of defenses and the waiver
of objection to venue set forth in the Credit Agreement with respect to
proceedings in the courts specified therein.

5. I have assumed that all parties other than the Company have duly
authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement.

6. I have assumed that you, as well as all other parties other than
the Company, have all requisite corporate power and authority and have
taken all necessary action to

consummate the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.

no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly
stated herein.

This opinion has been issued solely for the benefit of the Agents and
the Banks and no one else has the right to rely upon it. I further advise you
that I am not assuming any obligation to notify the Agents or the Banks of any

the date on which the transfer effected by this Commitment Transfer Supplement
shall become effective (the "Transfer Effective Date"), which date shall be the
fifth Business Day following the date of such Transfer Effective Notice unless a
shorter period is agreed to by the Administrative Agent. From and after the
Transfer Effective Date each Purchasing Bank shall be a Bank party to the Credit
Agreement for all purposes thereof.

2. At or before 12:00 Noon, local time of the Transferor Bank, on
the Transfer Effective Date, each Purchasing Bank shall pay to the Transferor
Bank, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the purchase price, as
agreed between the Transferor Bank and such Purchasing Bank (the "Purchase
Price"), of the portion being purchased by such Purchasing Bank (such Purchasing
Bank's "Purchased Percentage") of the outstanding Loans and other amounts owing
to the Transferor Bank under the Credit Agreement and the Notes. Effective upon
receipt by the Transferor Bank of the Purchase Price from a Purchasing Bank, the
Transferor Bank hereby irrevocably sells, assigns and transfers to such
Purchasing Bank, without recourse, representation or warranty, and each
Purchasing Bank hereby irrevocably purchases, takes and assumes from the
Transferor Bank, such Purchasing Bank's Purchased Percentage of the Commitments
and the presently outstanding Loans and other amounts owing to the Transferor
Bank under the Credit Agreement and the Notes together with all instruments,
documents and collateral security pertaining thereto.

3. The Transferor Bank has made arrangements with each Purchasing
Bank with respect to (i) the portion, if any, to be paid, and the date or dates
for payment, by the Transferor Bank to such Purchasing Bank of any fees
heretofore received by the Transferor Bank pursuant to the Credit Agreement
prior to the Transfer Effective Date and (ii) the portion, if any, to be paid,
and the date or dates for payment, by such Purchasing Bank to the Transferor
Bank of fees or interest received by such Purchasing Bank pursuant to the Credit
Agreement from and after the Transfer Effective Date.

4. (a) All principal payments that would otherwise be payable from
and after the Transfer Effective Date to or for the account of the Transferor
Bank pursuant to the Credit Agreement and its Note shall, instead, be payable to
or for the account of the Transferor Bank and the Purchasing Banks, as the case
may be, in accordance with their respective interests as reflected in this
Commitment Transfer Supplement.

(b) All interest, fees and other amounts that would otherwise accrue
for the account of the Transferor Bank from and

<PAGE>111

after the Transfer Effective Date pursuant to the Credit Agreement and its Note
shall, instead, accrue for the account of, and be payable to, the Transferor
Bank and the Purchasing Banks, as the case may be, in accordance with their
respective interests as reflected in this Commitment Transfer Supplement. In
the event that any amount of interest, fees or other amounts accruing prior to
the Transfer Effective Date was included in the Purchase Price paid by any
Purchasing Bank, the Transferor Bank and each Purchasing Bank will make
appropriate arrangements for payment by the Transferor Bank to such Purchasing
Bank of such amount upon receipt thereof from the Company.

5. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date, the Transferor Bank
will deliver to the Administrative Agent its Note. On or prior to the Transfer
Effective Date, the Company will deliver to the Administrative Agent Notes for
each Purchasing Bank and the Transferor Bank, in each case in principal amounts

reflecting, in accordance with the Credit Agreement, their Commitments (as
adjusted pursuant to this Commitment Transfer Supplement). As provided in
subsection 9.6(c) of the Credit Agreement, each such new Note shall be dated the
Closing Date. Promptly after the Transfer Effective Date, the Administrative
Agent will send to each of the Transferor Bank and the Purchasing Banks its new
Note, along with a schedule setting forth the amounts of Loans outstanding for
the Transferor Bank and each Purchasing Bank, and will send to the Company the
superseded Note of the Transferor Bank, marked "Cancelled". 

6. Concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, the
Transferor Bank will provide to each Purchasing Bank (if it is not already a
Bank party to the Credit Agreement) conformed copies of all documents delivered
to such Transferor Bank on the Closing Date in satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in the Credit Agreement.

7. Each of the parties to this Commitment Transfer Supplement agrees
that at any time and from time to time upon the written request of any other
party, it will execute and deliver such further documents and do such further
acts and things as such other party may reasonably request in order to effect
the purposes of this Commitment Transfer Supplement.

8. By executing and delivering this Commitment Transfer Supplement,
the Transferor Bank and each Purchasing Bank confirm to and agree with each
other and the Administrative Agent and the Banks as follows: (i) other than the
representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
interest being assigned hereby free and clear of any adverse claim, the
Transferor Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with the Credit Agreement or the execution, legality,

decision to enter into this Commitment Transfer Supplement; (iv) each Purchasing
Bank will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Transferor Bank or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement; (v) each Purchasing
Bank appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Credit Agreement as
