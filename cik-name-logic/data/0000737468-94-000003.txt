Item 5. Other Events
------------
On February 28, 1994, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), the primary federal regulator of the
Registrant's subsidiary bank, agreed to release the
subsidiary bank from a January 1993 board of directors
resolution regarding the payment of dividends and other
matters.

The January 1993 resolution stated that the subsidiary bank
would not pay any dividend to the Registrant unless it
provided advance notification to its federal and state
regulators and received no reasonable objection. The board
resolution also required the subsidiary bank to continue to
maintain plans and procedures for the maintenance of asset
quality, risk control and capital adequacy. The resolution
had been accepted by the FDIC pursuant to the termination of
a 1991 memorandum of understanding which required the
subsidiary bank to obtain prior regulatory approval for
payment of dividends to the Registrant.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Other Exhibits
