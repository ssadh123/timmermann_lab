ARTICLE VI

MUTUAL COVENANTS OF MMI, MMI SUB, MEDIQ AND MEDIQ SUB

Each of MMI, MMI Sub, MEDIQ and MEDIQ Sub, as the case may be, agrees and
covenants to the others, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, as

every way in carrying out the transactions contemplated herein and in delivering
all documents and instruments deemed reasonably necessary or useful by legal
counsel for any Party hereto.

6.2 Publicity. Each Party agrees that, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party without the prior written
consent of each other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange or the NASDAQ
National Market System, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow each other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

6.3 Best Efforts. Each Party will use all reasonable efforts to cause all
conditions to the Closing to be satisfied.

6.4 Warrant Agreement. MMI and MEDIQ agree, prior to the Closing, to
execute and deliver the Warrant Agreement.

Party, each such other Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such further or other actions as such other Party may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.6 Actions Contrary to Stated Intent. Each Party will use its best
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under
Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code and accordingly will not,
either before or after consummation of the Merger, take any action or fail to
take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a tax-free

such qualification.

6.7 Employee Matters.

(a) Except as a provided in Section 9.2(d) hereof, the Parties agree
that each of MMI, MMI Sub and the surviving corporation shall not be
required pursuant to this Agreement to offer employment or to continue
employment to persons employed by MEDIQ Sub ('MEDIQ Sub Employees') as of
the Closing Date.

(b) The Parties agree that each of MMI and MMI Sub shall not be
required pursuant to this Agreement to maintain after the Closing any
compensation and employee benefit plans, arrangements and perquisites
provided by MEDIQ Sub for any MEDIQ Sub Employee retained by MMI, MMI Sub
or the surviving corporation.

(c) MEDIQ and MEDIQ Sub shall take all action necessary so that MMI
and the surviving corporation do not incur any liability or continuing
obligation after the Closing for any Plan, except to the extent such
liability has been specifically accrued on the MEDIQ Sub Financials,
including without limitation MEDIQ Sub's participation in MEDIQ's fully
funded employee benefits plan(s) and its 401(k) plan and the distribution

provide to all employees of the surviving corporation, or cause to be
provided, as of the Effective Time, medical, dental, disability, workers

6.8 Tax Matters.

(a) MEDIQ will be responsible for and will cause to be prepared and
duly filed all Returns (as defined in Section 6.8(h)) in which MEDIQ Sub is
includible for all taxable years ending on or before the Effective Time,
and all consolidated, combined or similar Returns for periods beginning
September 30, 1993 and ending at the Effective Time with respect to which
MEDIQ Sub is includible for such period. MEDIQ shall prepare that portion
of any such Returns related to MEDIQ Sub in accordance with the methodology
used in prior years. MEDIQ will not amend that portion of any Return
related to MEDIQ Sub without the written approval of MMI, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld. MEDIQ will pay or cause to be paid, and
shall indemnify and hold MEDIQ Sub and MMI harmless against, all Taxes (as
defined in Section 6.8(h)) to which such Returns relate, but only to the
extent such Taxes have not been specifically accrued on the Closing Balance
Sheet.

(b) Other than Returns to be prepared by MEDIQ pursuant to paragraph
(a), MMI will be responsible for and will cause to be prepared and duly
filed any and all Returns of MEDIQ Sub for any and all taxable periods
which include and end after the Effective Time (the 'Overlap Period'), and
any taxable period beginning after the Effective Time. MEDIQ will be
responsible for and will indemnify and hold harmless MEDIQ Sub and MMI with
respect to all Taxes for the Overlap Period in an amount equal to the
liability for Taxes that would have resulted had the Overlap Period ended
at the Effective Time (utilizing, if applicable, the actual tax rate
imposed on a particular category of income by the applicable taxing
jurisdiction) and which Taxes have not been accrued on the Closing Balance
Sheet. Any amount so payable by MEDIQ will be remitted to MEDIQ Sub at
least ten business days prior to the due date of the respective returns
pursuant to written notice by MMI of such due date; provided that MEDIQ
approves of the amount (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld). MEDIQ Sub shall remit the full amount received from MEDIQ
pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) to the appropriate Tax authority within the
time period required by law.

(c) MMI will pay or cause to be paid and shall indemnify and hold
MEDIQ harmless from and against the following Taxes with respect to taxable
items of MEDIQ Sub: (i) any and all Taxes arising in or attributable to
any taxable period (or that portion of any taxable period) beginning after
the Closing Date, due or payable by MEDIQ Sub or MEDIQ (computed in a
manner consistent with the allocation of Taxes for the Overlap Period);
(ii) any and all Taxes not incurred in the ordinary course of business
attributable to acts or omissions of MMI or MEDIQ Sub occurring after the
Closing but on the Closing Date; (iii) any and all Taxes attributable to an
Overlap Period other than that portion of such Taxes for which MEDIQ is
responsible pursuant to Section 6.8(b) above; and (iv) any and all Taxes
arising in or attributable to any taxable period (or that portion of any
taxable period) ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent provided
for in the Closing Balance Sheet.

(d) MMI and MEDIQ Sub agree that, with respect to any Tax, MEDIQ Sub
shall not carry back a net operating loss which arises in any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date ('Subsequent Loss') to any taxable
period of MEDIQ ending on or before the Closing Date. If a Subsequent Loss
with respect to any Tax is carried back into any taxable period of MEDIQ
ending on or before the Closing Date, MEDIQ shall be entitled to any refund
or credit of Taxes realized as a result thereof. This paragraph (d) shall
not apply to any adjustment to which paragraph (e) applies.

(e) (i) If any adjustment is made to any Tax Return relating to MEDIQ
or any of its Affiliates (including MEDIQ Sub) for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (whether such
adjustment is a result of or in settlement of any audit, other
administrative proceeding or the filing of an amended return to reflect the
consequences of any determination made in connection with any such audit or
proceeding or otherwise) and there is a correlative offsetting adjustment
applicable to MMI or any of its Affiliates (including MEDIQ Sub) for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date, the
party whose adjustment is favorable (i.e., the party to which there inures,
directly or indirectly, a net Tax benefit as the result of any adjustment
(MMI or MEDIQ, as the case may be)) shall pay to the other party the amount
of such net Tax benefit at such time or times as and to the
extent that such benefit is realized through a refund of Tax or actual
reduction in the amount of Taxes which would otherwise be paid if such
adjustment had not been made; provided, however, that the party whose 
adjustment is favorable shall not be required to make a payment to the 
other party in excess of the amount (if any) of the net Tax detriment to 
such other party correlative to such net Tax benefit; provided, further, 
that if the party whose adjustment is favorable realizes a net Tax 
benefit prior to the time the other party realizes a net Tax detriment, 
the party whose adjustment is favorable shall not be required to make any
payment to the other party until such time or times as the net Tax 
detriment is actually realized by such other party.

(ii) If any adjustment is made to any Tax Return relating to MMI or
any of its Affiliates (including MEDIQ Sub) for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date (whether as a result of
or in settlement of any audit, other administrative proceeding or
judicial proceeding or the filing of an amended Return to reflect the
consequences of any determination made in connection with
any such audit or proceeding or otherwise) and there is a correlative
offsetting adjustment applicable to MEDIQ or any of its Affiliates
(including MEDIQ Sub) for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, the party whose adjustment is favorable
(i.e., the party to which there inures, directly or indirectly, a net
Tax benefit as the result of any adjustment (MMI or MEDIQ, as the case
may be)) shall pay to the other party the amount of such net Tax benefit
at such time or times as and to the extent that such benefit is realized
through a refund of Tax or actual reduction in the amount of Taxes which
would otherwise be paid if such adjustment had not been made; provided,
however, that the party whose adjustment is favorable shall not be
required to make a payment to the other party in excess of the amount
(if any) of the net Tax detriment to such other party correlative to
such net Tax benefit; provided, further, that if the party whose
adjustment is favorable realizes a net Tax benefit prior to the time the
other party realizes a net Tax detriment, the party whose adjustment is
favorable shall not be required to make any payment to the other party
until such time or times as the net Tax detriment is actually realized
by such other party.

(iii) If either MMI or MEDIQ makes a payment to the other party
pursuant to subparagraphs (i) or (ii) above and (a) it is later
determined by the applicable taxing authority that the party who made
such payment is not entitled to the net Tax benefit which gave rise to
such payment, then the party who received such payment shall promptly
remit to the party who made such payment the amount of such payment that
is attributable to the disallowed Tax benefit or (b) if, as a result of
a correlative adjustment, an attribute arising in a later period which
would otherwise be able to be carried back to the taxable year or years
in which the party making the payment thereunder realized a net Tax
benefit (a 'Displaced Carryback') cannot be utilized, the party
receiving a payment pursuant to this subsection (e) will repay to the
payer an amount sufficient to place the payer in the same position
(ignoring for the purpose any potential carryforward of the Displaced
Carryback) as it would have been if the correlative adjustment had not
occurred, except that the payer shall subsequently return an amount up
to such repayment when, as and to the extent the payer actually receives
a net Tax benefit from the Displaced Carryback.

(iv) For purposes of determining whether a correlative adjustment
described in this paragraph (e) has a net Tax benefit or detriment to 
the party affected, (a) all effects of such adjustment, including, 
without limitation, interest, penalties and additions to Tax required 
to be paid or received, any Tax imposed upon a refund or reduction in 
Tax and any Tax consequences occasioned by any payment made or to be 
made by one party to the other shall be taken into account, and (b) 
whether a party suffers a Tax detriment or receives a Tax benefit will 
be determined as if such party filed a separate Return for all periods.

(f) After the Effective Time, MMI and MEDIQ Sub, on the one hand, and
MEDIQ, on the other hand, will make available to the other, as reasonably
requested, all information, records or documents relating to the liability
for Taxes for all periods prior to or including the Effective Time and will
preserve such information, records or documents until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof.

(g) Any and all tax sharing, tax indemnity, or tax allocation
agreements with respect to which MEDIQ Sub was a party at any time prior to
the Effective Time shall terminate upon the Effective Time. No further
amounts shall be payable under such agreements following the Effective
Time, other than amounts due MEDIQ Sub with respect to all periods through
and including the Effective Time.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) the term 'Taxes' means (A)
all federal, state, local, foreign and other net income, gross income,
gross receipts, sales, use, ad valorem, value added, intangible, unitary,
capital gain, transfer, franchise, profits, license, lease, service,

with respect thereto, (B) any liability for payment of amounts described in
clause (A) whether as a result of transferee liability, of being a member
of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group for any period,
or otherwise through operation of law and (C) any liability for the payment
of amounts described in clauses (A) or (B) as a result of any tax sharing,

corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income tax law)
apply to any disposition of any asset owned by it;

(11) MEDIQ Sub was not acquired in a 'qualified stock purchase'

338(g) of the Code, protective carryover basis elections, or offset

this Agreement and all actions contemplated hereby for approval of MMI's
shareholders. MMI, with the cooperation of MEDIQ, will use all reasonable best
efforts to obtain and furnish the information required to be included by it in a
Proxy Statement or, if MMI, with the advice of legal counsel, reasonably
determines, an Information Statement (i) to file a Proxy Statement or
Information Statement, as the case may be, with the SEC as soon as practicable
after the date hereof, (ii) to respond as soon as possible to any comments of
the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement or Information Statement, as the case 
may be, and any preliminary version thereof and (iii) to cause the definitive 
Proxy Statement or Information Statement, as the case may be, relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to be mailed to
its shareholders, as soon as reasonably practicable. The Proxy Statement or
Information Statement, as the case may be, and all amendments and supplements
thereto, shall comply with applicable law. Each of MMI and MEDIQ agrees to
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
financial statements and affairs as the other shall reasonably request and as
shall be reasonably required in connection with the action to be taken by MMI to
prepare the Proxy Statement or Information Statement, as the case may be, or any
amendments or supplements thereto, and each of MMI and MEDIQ agrees to cause
their respective counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and
auditors in the preparation thereof. MMI will promptly advise MEDIQ, and MEDIQ
will promptly advise MMI, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time
either MMI or MEDIQ shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it
necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement or
Information Statement, as the case may be, in order to make the statements
contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading 
or to comply with applicable law. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, MMI shall not include in the Proxy Statement
or Information Statement, as the case may be, any information with respect to
MEDIQ or its affiliates or associates, the form and content of which information
shall not have been approved by MEDIQ prior to such inclusion, such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld.

Schedule 6.11(a) to MMI setting forth a list (by name, address and person to
contact) of the 20 largest customers of MEDIQ Sub and (b) as soon as practicable
after the date hereof, MEDIQ Sub shall deliver Schedule 6.11(b) to MMI setting

nor MMI Sub shall contact the suppliers set forth on Schedule 6.11(b) regarding
the accounts described therein without MEDIQ's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Except as set forth in Schedule
6.11(b), MEDIQ Sub does not have any sole source suppliers (othen than in

request but subject to Section 13.10 below (confidentiality and nondisclosure 
agreements); provided, that subject to Section 9.2(b) hereof, any furnishing 
of such information pursuant hereto or any investigation by MMI shall not 
affect MMI's right to rely on the representations, warranties, agreements and 
covenants made by each of MEDIQ and MEDIQ Sub in this Agreement; and, provided,

and MEDIQ Sub shall deliver to MMI all written documentation requested by it

practicable following the registration of the MMI Shares by MMI pursuant to the
terms and conditions of Article XI hereof, but in no event later than 60 days
following such registration; provided, however, that MEDIQ may distribute the
MMI Shares to its stockholders without registration thereof but only if Wilson,
Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati shall have delivered to MMI, in a form reasonably
acceptable to MMI and its legal counsel, its legal opinion that such
distribution shall not violate Federal or applicable state securities laws and

8.1 Nomination of Two Directors to MMI Board.

after the Closing Date and not later than 60 days in advance of the next 
meeting held for the purpose of electing directors to be nominated for 
election to the board of directors of MMI; provided, however, that MEDIQ 
in its written designation of such individuals shall provide MMI with (i)
such information regarding each designee proposed by MEDIQ as would be 
required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy 
rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had the 
nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of 
Directors of MMI, (ii) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director
of MMI if so elected and (iii) any other information reasonably requested

obligation to distribute the MMI Shares in accordance with Section 7.12
hereof or (ii) upon a distribution by MEDIQ of the MMI Shares or the

to designate another individual, reasonably acceptable to a majority of the
other members of the board of directors of MMI, to fill the vacancy created
by such cessation in order to serve as a member of the board of directors
of MMI; provided, however, that MEDIQ in its written designation of such
individual shall provide MMI with such information regarding each designee
proposed by MEDIQ as would be required to be included in a proxy statement
filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be
nominated, by the board of directors of MMI, and any other information
reasonably requested by MMI. The board of directors of MMI shall review
such information and determine whether such designee is reasonably
acceptable to serve as a member of the board of directors of MMI (such
chosen designee, a 'Successor') as soon as reasonably practicable following
MEDIQ's designation of such individual. The process set forth in this
Section 8.1(b) shall be repeated until such vacancy no longer exists.

(c) MMI hereby covenants and agrees (i) to exercise its reasonable and
good faith efforts as of the Effective Time and until the MMI Shares are
distributed by MEDIQ to its stockholders, to cause the MEDIQ Designees and
any Successor to serve as members of the board of directors of MMI and (ii)

ordinary course of business;

(e) amend MMI's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; or

course of MMI's business as currently conducted.

8.3 Material Operating Decisions. Prior to the Effective Time MMI agrees
to consult with MEDIQ concerning any of its material operating decisions
(including, without limitation, proposed employee hiring, layoff and termination
decisions). Notwithstanding the foregoing MEDIQ expressly acknowledges that MMI
alone shall make such operating decisions and if the Merger does not close,
MEDIQ shall have no liability to MMI in respect to such consultation; and if the
Merger does close, such consultation shall not effect the rights of MEDIQ set
forth in Article X hereof.

shall not affect MEDIQ's right to rely on the representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants made by each of MMI and MMI Sub in this Agreement.

8.5 Commitment to Favorable Vote. MMI agrees to vote all shares of MMI
Sub Common Stock held by it in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein.

8.6 MEDIQ Guarantees. MMI will use its reasonable efforts to obtain

ARTICLE X

INDEMNITY

10.1 Indemnification of MMI and the Surviving Corporation. MEDIQ agrees
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless MMI, and the surviving corporation from
and against and shall reimburse MMI and the surviving corporation against and in
respect of any and all Losses that MMI or the surviving corporation shall incur
or suffer and which arise from or are attributable to, by reason of or in
connection with any breach or inaccuracy of or any failure to perform or comply
with any of MEDIQ's or MEDIQ Sub's representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants contained in this Agreement, including all schedules and certificates
referred to herein or officers' certificates required to be delivered hereunder;
provided, however, that indemnification for matters specifically contemplated by
Section 11.6 shall be governed by such section and not this Section 10.1.

The indemnity obligations of MEDIQ pursuant to this Section 10.1 for a
breach or inaccuracy of or a failure to perform or comply with any or all of
such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall terminate upon
the earlier of (i) the distribution of the MMI Shares to the stockholders of
MEDIQ pursuant to a registration statement prepared by MMI in accordance with
Article XI hereof and (ii) April 30, 1995 (the earlier date, the
'Indemnification Cut-off Date'), except with respect to the obligations,
representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.8(i) hereof (tax matters)
which shall terminate sixty days following the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to the Tax with respect to which the representation or
warranty applies (the 'Tax Indemnification Cut-off Date'), and, in either case,
except to the extent that a Notice (as defined in Section 10.3 below) has been
delivered to MEDIQ prior to the Indemnification Cut-off Date or the Tax
Indemnification Cut-off Date, as applicable in respect of claims for
indemnification set forth in such Notice.

Except as set forth in the immediately succeeding sentence, MEDIQ shall
have no obligations under this Section 10.1 unless and until the aggregate
amount of liability for Losses to MMI and the surviving corporation exceeds
$300,000, whereupon MEDIQ shall be liable to indemnify for all such amounts over
$300,000 up to a maximum aggregate of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000).

In any case in which claims for indemnification have been asserted by MMI
or the surviving corporation and have been set forth in a Notice, all Parties
agree that the indemnity obligations of MEDIQ with respect to such matters shall
continue in full force and effect until such matters have been settled by
agreement of the Parties or by resolution of such matters in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Subject to Section 9.2(b) no
disclosure by MEDIQ or MEDIQ Sub other than the disclosure contained in this
Agreement, including the schedules hereto, nor any investigation made by or on
behalf of MMI or MMI Sub with respect to MEDIQ or MEDIQ Sub shall be deemed to
affect MMI's reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by MEDIQ or MEDIQ Sub contained in this Agreement
and shall not constitute a waiver of MMI's or the surviving corporation's
rights to indemnity as herein provided for the breach or inaccuracy of or
failure to perform or comply with any of MEDIQ's or MEDIQ Sub's representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement.

10.2 Indemnification of MEDIQ. MMI agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless MEDIQ from and against and shall reimburse MEDIQ against and in respect
of any and all Losses that MEDIQ shall incur or suffer and which arise from or
are attributable to, by reason of or in connection with any breach or inaccuracy
of or any failure to perform or comply with any of MMI's representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this Agreement, including all
schedules and certificates referred to herein and officers' certificates
required to be delivered hereunder; provided, however, that indemnification for
matters specifically contemplated by Section 11.6 shall be governed by such
section and not this Section 10.2.

The indemnity obligations of MMI pursuant to this Section 10.2 for a breach
or inaccuracy of or a failure to perform or comply with any or all of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall terminate upon the
Indemnification Cut-off Date, except to the extent a Notice (as defined in
Section 10.3) has been delivered to MMI prior to the Indemnification Cut-off
Date in respect of claims for indemnification set forth in such Notice.

MMI shall have no obligations under this Section 10.2 unless and until the
aggregate amount of liability for Losses to MEDIQ exceeds $300,000, whereupon
MMI shall be liable to indemnify MEDIQ for all such amounts over $300,000 up to
a maximum aggregate of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000).

In any case in which claims for indemnification have been asserted by MEDIQ
and have been set forth in a Notice, all Parties agree that the indemnity
obligations of MMI with respect to such matters shall continue in full force and
effect until such matters have been settled by agreement of the Parties or by
resolution of such matters in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Subject to Section 9.3(b), no disclosure by MMI or MMI Sub other
than the disclosure contained in this Agreement, including the schedules hereto,
nor any investigation made by or on behalf of MEDIQ or MEDIQ Sub, with respect
to MMI or MMI Sub shall be deemed to affect MEDIQ's reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by MMI or MMI Sub
contained in this Agreement and shall not constitute a waiver of MEDIQ's rights
to indemnity as herein provided for the breach or inaccuracy of or failure to
perform or comply with any of MMI's or MMI Sub's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements under this Agreement.

10.3 Procedure for Indemnification

(a) In the event that a Party shall incur or suffer any Losses in
respect of which indemnification may be sought by such party pursuant to
the provisions of this Article X, the party seeking to be indemnified
hereunder (the 'Indemnitee') shall assert a claim for indemnification by
written notice (a 'Notice') to the party from whom indemnification is
sought (the 'Indemnitor') briefly stating the nature and basis of such
claim. In the case of Losses arising by reason of any third party claim,
the Notice shall be given within 25 days of the filing or other written
assertion of any such claim against the Indemnitee, but the failure of the
Indemnitee to give the Notice within such time period shall not relieve 
the Indemnitor of any liability that the Indemnitor may have to the 
Indemnitee except to the extent that the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced
thereby; provided, however, that any such notice shall be given no later 
than the Indemnification Cut-off Date, or the Tax Indemnification Cut-off
Date, as applicable.

(b) The Indemnitee shall provide to the Indemnitor on request all
information and documentation reasonably necessary to support and verify
any Losses which the Indemnitee believes give rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall give the Indemnitor reasonable access
to all books, records and personnel in the possession or under the control
of the Indemnitee which would have bearing on such claim.

(c) In the case of third party claims for which indemnification is
sought, the Indemnitor shall have the option (i) to conduct any proceedings
or negotiations in connection therewith, (ii) to take all other steps to
settle or defend any such claim (provided that the Indemnitor
shall not settle any such claim without the
consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and (iii) to employ counsel to contest any such claim or
liability in the name of the Indemnitee or otherwise. In any event, the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate at its own expense with its own
counsel in any proceedings relating to any third party claim. The
Indemnitor shall, within 25 days of receipt of the Notice, notify the
Indemnitee of its intention to assume the defense of the claim. Until the
Indemnitee has received notice of the Indemnitor's election whether to
defend any claim, the Indemnitee shall take reasonable steps to defend (but
may not settle) such claim and the reasonable costs and expenses (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection therewith shall
be reimbursed by Indemnitor if and to the extent the claim itself is one
for which indemnification is owing hereunder. If the Indemnitor shall
decline to assume the defense of any such claim, or shall fail to notify
the Indemnitee within 25 days after receipt of the notice of the
Indemnitor's election to defend such claim, the Indemnitee may settle such
claim (provided that any such settlement without the prior written consent
of the Indemnitor shall not be determinative of the amount of any
Loss). If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that it wishes to accept
a bona fide written offer from any such claimant or plaintiff (which offer
includes a release of the Indemnitor from all liability in respect of such
claim), and the Indemnitee does not consent to such settlement, the
Indemnitor shall not be liable under this Section 10.3 for the amount by
which any subsequent settlement or judgment with respect to such claim
exceeds such bona fide written settlement offer. The expenses of all
proceedings, contests or lawsuits in respect of such claims shall be borne
by the Indemnitor if and to the extent such third party claim itself is one
for which indemnification is owing hereunder. Regardless of which Party
shall assume the defense of the claim, the Parties agree to cooperate fully
with one another in connection therewith. If and to the extent the
Indemnitor is responsible pursuant hereto to indemnify the Indemnitee in
respect of a third party claim then within 10 days after the occurrence of
a settlement or judgment with respect to such third party claim, the
Indemnitor shall deliver to the Indemnitee, at the Indemnitor's option
either: (a) the number of shares (in whole shares) of MMI Common Stock that
have an aggregate value (valued at $5.25 per share) most nearly equal to 
the amount of any Losses (or such portion thereof as the
Indemnitor shall be responsible for pursuant to the provisions hereof), or
(b) cash equal to the amount of any Losses (or such portion thereof as the
Indemnitor shall be responsible for pursuant to the provisions hereof). 
In the event that any Losses incurred by the Indemnitee do not involve 
payment by the Indemnitee of a third party claim, then, if and to the 
extent the Indemnitor is responsible pursuant hereto to indemnify the 
Indemnitee against such Losses, the Indemnitor shall within 10 days after
agreement on the amount of Losses or the determination of the amount by 
an arbitrator in accordance with Section 10.4 hereof deliver to the 
Indemnitee at the Indemnitor's option either: (a) the number of shares 
(in whole shares) of MMI Common Stock that have an aggregate value (valued
at $5.25 per share) most nearly equal to the amount of such Losses
(or such portion thereof as the Indemnitor shall be responsible for 
pursuant to the provisions hereof), or (b) cash equal to the amount of 
such Losses (or the portion thereof as the Indemnitor shall be responsible
for pursuant to the provisions hereof). Any shares of MMI Common Stock 
delivered by (i) MEDIQ to MMI to satisfy Losses shall be cancelled and 
(ii) MMI to MEDIQ to satisfy Losses shall be deemed fully paid and 
nonassessable.

10.4 Arbitration. Any controversy involving a claim by an indemnified
party pursuant to this Article X shall be finally settled by arbitration in Los
Angeles, California, in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. Such arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator chosen by mutual
agreement of MMI and MEDIQ. Failing such agreement, the arbitration shall be
conducted by 3 independent arbitrators, none of whom shall have any competitive
interest with MMI or MEDIQ: MMI shall choose one such arbitrator, MEDIQ shall
choose one such arbitrator, and such two arbitrators shall mutually select a
third arbitrator. Any decision of two such arbitrators shall be binding on MMI
and MEDIQ. There shall be limited discovery prior to the arbitration hearing,
subject to the discretion of the arbitrators, as follows: (a) exchange of
witness lists and copies of documentary evidence and documents related to or
arising out of the issues to be arbitrated, (b) depositions of all party
witnesses, and (c) such other depositions as may be allowed by the arbitrator
upon a showing of good cause. Depositions shall be conducted in accordance with
the California Code of Civil Procedure. Each party shall pay its own costs and
expenses (including counsel fees) of any such arbitration except that the
arbitrator can compel one Party to pay all or a portion of the other Party's
costs and expenses.

10.5 Survivability of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements. Except as expressly set forth herein, each Party's respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and any other document delivered in connection herewith shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect after the date which is the
Indemnification Cut-off Date, except with respect to (i) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 6.8(i) hereof (tax matters) which shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect after the date which is the Tax
Indemnification Cut-off Date and (ii) the covenants and agreements of either MMI
or MEDIQ set forth herein which by their terms pertain to periods following the
Indemnification Cut-off Date.

10.6 Exclusive Remedy. Except as set forth herein, the respective
indemnity obligations of MMI and MEDIQ pursuant to this Article X, (together
with all of MMI Parties' and MEDIQ Parties' representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements) shall survive the Closing and the indemnity
obligations set forth in this Article X, absent fraud, shall be the exclusive
remedy of MMI and MEDIQ, with respect to matters resulting in Losses; provided
that the Parties recognize and agree that in the event of a breach by the MMI
Parties on the one hand or the MEDIQ Parties on the other hand of the covenants
and agreements set forth in Sections 6.5, 7.5, 7.9, 7.11, 7.12, 8.1, 8.5, and
Article 11 that money damages would not be an adequate remedy to either for such
breach and, even if money damages were adequate, it would be impossible to
ascertain or measure with any degree of accuracy the damages sustained by the
respective Parties therefrom and, accordingly, if there should be a breach or
threatened breach of such sections, the Party to be harmed thereby shall be
entitled to an injunction restraining the other or others from any breach
without showing or proving actual damages. Nothing in the preceding sentence
shall limit or otherwise affect any remedies the Parties may otherwise have
against each other under Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, such covenants and agreements shall survive the
Closing and terminate only upon expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitations.

ARTICLE XI

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

11.1 Definitions. For purposes of this Article XI:

(a) The terms 'register,' 'registered,' and 'registration' refer to a
registration effected by preparing and filing a registration statement in
compliance with the 1933 Act and the declaration or ordering of
effectiveness of such registration statement; and

(b) The term 'Registrable Securities' refers to the MMI Shares, the
Noncompetition Shares, the Warrant and Warrant Shares and any MMI Common
Stock issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in
exchange or in replacement thereof except that the MMI Shares, the
Noncompetition Shares, the Warrant or Warrant Shares (or any particular
shares thereof) shall cease to be Registrable Securities when and to the
extent (i) except as otherwise contemplated by Section 11.2(b) hereof, a
registration statement with respect to the sale of the MMI Shares, the
Noncompetition Shares, the Warrant or Warrant Shares has become effective
under the 1933 Act and the MMI Shares, the Noncompetition Shares, the
Warrant and Warrant Shares have been disposed of in accordance with such
registration statement; or (ii) the MMI Shares, the Warrant or Warrant
Shares cease to be outstanding; or (iii) except as otherwise contemplated
by Section 11.2(b), the MMI Shares shall have been distributed to the
stockholders of MEDIQ pursuant to the provisions beginning 'provided,
however' in Section 7.12 hereof.

11.2 Registration.

(a) MMI shall employ its reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable
Securities to be registered under the 1933 Act as soon as reasonably
practicable after the filing of its annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ending April 28, 1995; provided, however, that if MMI shall
furnish to MEDIQ a certificate signed by its President stating that, in the
good faith judgment of the board of directors of MMI, it would be 
detrimental to MMI or its shareholders for a registration statement to be
filed in the near future, then MMI shall have the right to defer the 
filing of a registration statement with respect to such Registrable 
Securities until such time as the board of directors of MMI deems 
advisable, but in no event later than November 30, 1995, and thereafter 
shall employ its reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable Securities 
to be registered under the 1933 Act as soon as practicable.

MMI shall be obligated to effect only one registration pursuant to this
Article XI.

(b) The registration referred to in Section 11.2(a) hereof shall cover
the subsequent sale of Registrable Securities distributed to any MEDIQ
stockholders who may also then be deemed an 'affiliate' (as defined in the
1933 Act) of MMI (each such Person, an 'Affiliate Stockholder'), and MMI
shall cause the registration statement with respect to such Affiliate
Stockholders' Registrable Securities to remain effective for 180 days after
first becoming effective; provided, however, that no Affiliate Stockholder
shall sell an amount of Registrable Securities to any one purchaser
constituting more than 5% of then outstanding MMI Common Stock pursuant to
the registration statement.

(c) MMI and MEDIQ shall enter into a 'piggy-back' registration rights
agreement which shall contain customary terms and conditions,
including without limitation (i) the transfer of such rights from MEDIQ to
Affiliate Stockholders upon distribution pursuant to Section 7.12 hereof,
(ii) the period such rights shall survive which shall be for a period of
two years following the expiration of the 180-day period referred to in
Section 11.2(b) above and (iii) indemnification provisions substantially
similar to those provided for in Section 11.6 hereof.

(d) Nothwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13.13 hereof,
it is expressly agreed that the Affiliate Stockholders at the time of the
distribution pursuant to Section 7.12 are intended thrid party
beneficiaries of Article XI as applicable to such Affiliate Stockholders.

11.3 Obligations of MMI. Whenever required under paragraph 11.2 to use
its reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities,
MMI shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

(a) Prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with
respect to such Registrable Securities and use its best efforts to cause
such registration statement to become effective.

(b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such
registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by
such registration statement.

(c) Furnish to MEDIQ such numbers of copies of a prospectus, and such
other documents as it may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of Registrable Securities owned by it.

(d) Use its reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities
covered by such registration statement under such other securities or Blue
Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably appropriate for the
distribution of the securities covered by the registration statement,
provided that MMI shall not be required in connection therewith or as a
condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to
service of process in any such states or jurisdictions.

11.4 Condition Precedent. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of MMI to take any action pursuant to this Article XI that MEDIQ
shall furnish to MMI information regarding MEDIQ, the Registrable Securities
held by MEDIQ and other such information as MMI shall reasonably request and as
shall be required in connection with the action to be taken by MMI.

11.5 Expenses of Registration. All expenses incurred by MMI in connection
with preparation of a registration statement, I including without limitation all
registration and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and
disbursements of counsel for MMI shall be borne by MMI.

11.6 Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in Article X hereof, in connection with the Registrable Securities being
included in a registration statement under this Article XI:

(a) To the extent permitted by law, MMI will indemnify and hold
harmless MEDIQ and each Person, if any, who controls MEDIQ within the
meaning of the 1933 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
to which they may become subject under the 1933 Act insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based on any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments
or supplements thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; 
and will reimburse MEDIQ or such controlling person of MEDIQ for any 
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection 
with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, 
liability, or action; provided, however, that the indemnity 
agreement contained in this paragraph 11.6(a) shall not (i) apply
to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability,
or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of MMI (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); or (ii) apply to any such case
for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that
it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission made in connection with such
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, or
amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished by MEDIQ or such controlling person of MEDIQ
for use in connection with such registration.

(b) To the extent permitted by law, MEDIQ will indemnify and hold
harmless MMI, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed
the registration statement, each Person, if any, who controls MMI within
the meaning of the 1933 Act, and each agent for MMI against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities to which MMI or any such director, officer,
controlling person or agent of MMI may become subject under the 1933 Act
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material
fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or
supplements thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in 
each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in such registration statement, preliminary or final
prospectus, or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished by MEDIQ for use in connection with
such registration; and MEDIQ will reimburse any legal or other expenses 
reasonably incurred by MMI or any such director, officer, controlling 
person or agent of MMI in connection with investigating or defending any 
such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however, that 
the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 11.6(b) shall not 
apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, 
liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of
MEDIQ (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). This indemnity
will be in addition to any liability which MEDIQ may otherwise have.

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will: (i) give
notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification; and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for
any settlement made without its consent (but such consent will not be
unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified
by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the
reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may
exist between such indemnified party and any other such indemnified parties
with respect to such claim. The failure to notify an indemnifying party of
the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to
defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability
to the indemnified party under this paragraph, but the omission to notify
the indemnifying party will not relieve him of any liability that he may
have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this paragraph.

11.7 Transfer of Registration Rights. The registration rights of MEDIQ
under this Article XI shall not be transferred to any transferee who acquires
any shares of the Registrable Securities without the prior written consent of
MMI which may be withheld for any reason or no reason at all, provided, however,
that the registration rights of MEDIQ under this Article XI may be transferred
to one transferee who acquires all the shares of Registrable Securities in a
transaction where MEDIQ is selling all of its outstanding capital stock or
substantially all of its assets or where MEDIQ is merged into another
corporation and is not the surviving entity with the prior written consent of
MMI which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

ARTICLE XII

TERMINATION

12.1 Termination by Mutual Consent. Notwithstanding approval of the
Merger by MMI, MMI Sub, MEDIQ or MEDIQ Sub, or their respective stockholders,
this Agreement may be terminated (i) at any time prior to the Closing by written
consent of MMI and MEDIQ or (ii) by either MMI or MEDIQ if the Closing does 
not occur within 120 days of the date of this Agreement provided that no MMI 
Party as to MMI and no MEDIQ Party as to MEDIQ is in breach of any of its 
representations, warranties, consents or agreements contained herein.

12.2 Termination by MMI. MMI may terminate this Agreement at any time
prior to the Closing by delivery of written notice to MEDIQ if: (a) MMI
determines in the exercise of its reasonable judgment that the pendency of any
lawsuit or the institution or threat of any governmental or administrative
action, investigation or inquiry which questions the validity or the legality of
the transactions contemplated hereby or which seeks to prevent, restrain, change
or obtain damages in respect of such transactions, makes it inadvisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding that such
lawsuit, action, investigation or inquiry may be deemed to be without merit; (b)
MEDIQ or MEDIQ Sub have breached or violated this Agreement in any material
respect and, if such breach or violation is curable, has failed to cure such
violations within 10 days of receiving written notice thereof.

12.3 Termination by MEDIQ. MEDIQ may terminate this Agreement at any time
prior to the Closing by delivery of written notice to MMI if: (a) MEDIQ
determines in the exercise of its reasonable judgment that the pendency of any
lawsuit or the institution or threat of any governmental or administrative
action, investigation or inquiry which questions the validity or the legality of
the transactions contemplated hereby or which seeks to prevent, restrain, change
or obtain damages in respect of such transactions, makes it inadvisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding that such
lawsuit, action, investigation or inquiry may be deemed to be without merit; (b)
MMI or MMI Sub has breached or violated this Agreement in any material respect
and, if such breach or violation is curable, has failed to cure such violations
within 10 days of receiving written notice thereof; or (c) any representation or
warranty made by MMI or MMI Sub is false or inaccurate in any material respect
or there is any material misrepresentation or omission by either MMI or MMI Sub;
or (d) the average of the daily closing prices for 10 consecutive trading days
of the MMI Common Stock between the date of this Agreement and the second day
preceding the Closing falls below $4.00 (a 'Stock Price Default') provided MEDIQ
delivers written notice of its election to terminate within 10 business days of
the occurrence of a Stock Price Default. For purposes of this Section 12.3, the
closing price for each day shall be the last such reported sales price, or, in
case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing
bid and asked prices for such day of the MMI Common Stock in the over-the
counter market as reported by the Nasdaq National Market System or any
comparable system.

12.4 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination as provided
above, all parties hereto shall bear their own costs associated with this
Agreement and all transactions mentioned herein and there shall be no obligation
on the part of either party's officers, directors or share/stockholders;
provided, that (a) Sections 13.5 (publicity), 13.9 (each party to bear own
costs), 13.10 (confidentiality) and 13.11 (attorneys' fees) shall survive such
termination and continue in full force and effect and (b) nothing herein will
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

EXHIBIT A -- Form of Warrant Agreement

WARRANT AGREEMENT

This WARRANT AGREEMENT (the 'Agreement') is made as of [__________], 1994
between MMI Medical, Inc., a California corporation ('MMI'), and MEDIQ
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ('MEDIQ').

RECITALS

WHEREAS, in connection with that certain Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization among MMI, MMI Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., MEDIQ and MEDIQ
Equipment and Maintenance Services, Inc. dated [______________], 1994 (the
'Reorganization Agreement'), MMI shall issue to MEDIQ (i) 2,050,000 shares (the
'MMI Shares') of $0.01 par value common stock of MMI (the 'MMI Common Stock')
and (ii) one warrant (the 'Warrant') entitling MEDIQ to purchase an aggregate of
325,000 shares of MMI Common Stock (the shares of MMI Common Stock issued upon
exercise of the Warrant are referred to herein as the 'Warrant Shares'); and

WHEREAS, in connection with the Reorganization Agreement, MMI and MEDIQ
have agreed to enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
set forth herein and in the Reorganization Agreement, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

ISSUANCE AND DELIVERY OF THE WARRANT

1.01. Issuance of the Warrant. Subject to the Closing (as defined and as
such other capitalized terms used herein without definition are defined in the
Reorganization Agreement) having occurred MMI will issue and deliver the Warrant
to MEDIQ on the Closing Date. The Warrant shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit 1 attached hereto. The Warrant shall be dated the Closing Date, and
shall be signed on behalf of MMI by its President or a Vice President under its
corporate seal reproduced thereon and attested by its Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary.

ARTICLE II

DURATION AND EXERCISE OF THE WARRANT

2.01. Duration of Warrant. The Warrant may be exercised on or after the
business day following the Closing and prior to the close of business on the
fourth anniversary thereof, except as otherwise provided in Article IV hereof.

2.02. Terms of Exercise. The Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to
purchase the number of shares of MMI Common Stock stated therein, adjusted as
provided in Article III, upon payment of $6.25 per share, adjusted as provided
in Article III. Such price, as in effect from time to time as provided in
Article III, is referred to herein as the 'Exercise Price.'

2.03. Exercise of the Warrant.

(a) The Warrant shall be exercised in whole or in part by surrendering
it, together with a subscription in the form appearing on the reverse side
thereof duly executed and accompanied by a certified or official bank 
check in payment of the Exercise Price.

(b) In lieu of paying the Exercise Price to MMI with respect to the
exercise of the Warrant into Warrant Shares as required by Section 2.03(a)
hereof, the holder may pay all or any portion of the Exercise Price with 
respect to such Warrant Shares by surrendering the Warrant to MMI to the 
extent representing Warrant Shares equal to (A) the aggregate Exercise 
Price of the Warrant Shares so surrendered, divided by (B) the excess of 
(1) the current market price per share of MMI Common Stock (determined as
provided in Section 3.01(d) below) on the business day immediately 
preceding the date on which the Warrant is delivered to the Company for 
exercise, over (2) the Exercise Price per share in effect at such time.
Any Warrant surrendered pursuant to this Section 2.03(b) shall be
accompanied by a duly completed and executed Assignment in such form as 
attached to the Warrant set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto assigning
the right to purchase surrendered Warrant Shares to the Company.

(c) The Warrant shall be exercisable during the period provided in
Section 2.01 hereof at any time in whole or from time to time in part. As
soon as practicable after the Warrant has been so exercised, MMI shall
issue and deliver or cause to be delivered to, or upon the order of, the
holder of such Warrant, in such name or names as may be directed by such
holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares
to which such holder is entitled, and cash as provided in Section 3.09 in
respect of any remaining fractional interest in a Warrant Share and, if
such Warrant shall not have been exercised in full, a new Warrant for the
number of full shares of MMI Common Stock as to which such Warrant shall
not have been exercised. Any Warrant so surrendered shall be cancelled by
or on behalf of MMI.

2.04. Common Stock Issued upon Exercise of the Warrant.

(a) All Warrant Shares, when issued in accordance with the terms
hereof, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and shall be free and clear of all Encumbrances. MMI shall
pay all documentary stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the initial
issuance of Warrant Shares. MMI shall not be required, however, to pay any
tax imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue of the
Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the holder of the Warrant who
shall have exercised the same. In such case, MMI shall not be required to
issue any certificate for Warrant Shares until the person or persons
requesting the same shall have paid to MMI the amount of any such tax or
shall have established to MMI's reasonable satisfaction that the tax has
been paid or that no tax is due.

(b) Irrespective of the date of issue of certificates for any Warrant
Shares, each person in whose name any certificate is issued shall be deemed
to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Shares represented
thereby on the date on which the Warrant was exercised and payment of the
Exercise Price was tendered as provided in Section 2.03.

ARTICLE III

ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS

3.01. Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of Warrant Shares. The
number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant
and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(a) If MMI shall (i) pay a dividend in shares of MMI Common Stock or
make a distribution in shares of MMI Common Stock, (ii) subdivide its
outstanding shares of MMI Common Stock, (iii) combine its outstanding
shares of MMI Common Stock or (iv) issue by reclassification of its shares
of MMI Common Stock other securities of MMI (including any such
reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which MMI
is the surviving corporation), the number of Warrant Shares purchasable
upon exercise of each Warrant immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted
so that the holder of each Warrant shall be entitled to receive the kind
and number of Warrant Shares or other securities of MMI which the holder
would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening
of any of the events described above, had such Warrant been exercised
immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date with
respect thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall
become effective immediately after the effective date of such event
retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event. Such adjustment
shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur.

(b) If MMI shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of
the outstanding MMI Common Stock, without any charge to such holders,
entitling them (for a period within 45 days after the record date mentioned
below) to subscribe for or purchase shares of MMI Common Stock at a price
per share which is lower at the record date mentioned below than the then
current market price per share of MMI Common Stock (as defined in paragraph
(d) below), the number of Warrant Shares thereafter purchasable upon the
exercise of each Warrant shall be determined by multiplying the number of
Warrant Shares theretofore purchasable upon exercise of each Warrant by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of MMI
Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options or
warrants plus the number of additional shares of MMI Common Stock offered
for subscription or purchase, and the denominator of which shall be the
number of shares of MMI Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of
such rights, options or warrants plus the number of shares which the
aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of MMI Common Stock
so offered would purchase at the current market price per share of MMI
Common Stock at such record date. Such adjustment shall be made whenever
such rights, options or warrants are issued, and shall become effective
immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such rights, options and warrants.

(c) If MMI shall distribute to all holders of shares of MMI Common
Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a
consolidation or merger in which MMI is the surviving corporation)
evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or
distributions payable out of consolidated earnings or earned surplus and
dividends or distributions referred to in paragraph (a) above or in the
paragraph immediately following this paragraph) or rights, options or 
warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right 
to subscribe for or purchase shares of MMI Common Stock (excluding those 
referred to in paragraph (b) above) then, in each case, the number of 
Warrant Shares thereafter purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant 
shall be determined by multiplying the number of Warrant Shares 
theretofore purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant by a fraction, 
the numerator of which shall be the then current market price per share of
MMI Common Stock (as defined in paragraph (d) below) on the date of such 
distribution, and the denominator of which shall be the then current 
market price per share of MMI Common Stock (as defined in paragraph (d)
below), less the then fair value (as determined in good faith by the 
board of directors of MMI, whose determination shall be conclusive
if made in good faith) of the portion of the assets or evidences of 
indebtedness so distributed or of such subscription rights, options or 
warrants, or of such convertible or exchangeable securities applicable to
one share of MMI Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever 
any such distribution is made, and shall become effective on the date of 
distribution retroactive to the record date for the determination of 
shareholders entitled to receive such distributions.

If MMI shall make a distribution to all holders of the shares of MMI 
Common Stock of stock of a subsidiary or securities convertible into or 
exercisable for such stock, then in lieu of an adjustment in the number of
Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant, the holder 
of each Warrant, upon the exercise thereof at any time after such 
distribution, shall be entitled to receive from MMI, such subsidiary or 
both, as MMI shall determine, the stock or other securities to which such
holder would have been entitled if such holder had exercised such Warrant
immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided 
in this Section 3.01; provided, however, that no adjustment in respect of
dividends or interest on such stock or other securities shall be made
during the term of a Warrant or upon the exercise of a Warrant.

(d) For the purpose of any computation under (i) Section 2.03(b), (ii)
paragraphs (b) or (c) of this Section 3.01 and (iii) Section 3.05, the
current market price per share of MMI Common Stock at any date shall be the
average of the daily closing prices for 20 consecutive trading days
commencing 30 trading days before the date of such computation. The closing
price for each day shall be the last such reported sales price regular way
or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such day, the average of
the closing bid and asked prices regular way for such day, in each case on
the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of MMI
Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or
admitted to trading, the closing sale price, or if none available, the
average of the closing bid and asked prices of the MMI Common Stock in the
over-the-counter market as reported by the NASDAQ National Market System 
or any comparable system or if not approved for quotation on the NASDAQ 
National Market System or any comparable system, the average of the 
closing bid and asked prices as furnished by two members of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. selected from time to time by MMI
for that purpose.

(e) No adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares purchasable
hereunder shall be required unless such adjustment would require an
increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the number of Warrant
Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant; provided, however,
that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (e) are not required
to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment. All calculations shall be made to the nearest
one-thousandth of a share.

(f) Whenever the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the
exercise of each Warrant is adjusted, as herein provided, the Exercise
Price payable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be adjusted by
multiplying the Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Warrant Shares
purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant immediately prior to such
adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the number of Warrant
Shares purchasable immediately thereafter.

(g) No adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the
exercise of each Warrant need be made under paragraphs (b) and (c) if MMI
issues or distributes to each holder of Warrants the rights, option,
warrant, or convertible or exchangeable securities, or evidences of
indebtedness or assets referred to in those paragraphs which each holder of
Warrants would have been entitled to receive had the Warrants been
exercised prior to the happening of such event or the record date with
respect thereto. No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value
of the Warrant Shares.

(h) In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made
pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the holders of Warrant shall become
entitled to purchase any securities of MMI other than shares of MMI Common
Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so purchasable upon
exercise of each Warrant and the Exercise Price of such shares shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly
equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Warrant
Shares contained in paragraphs (a) through (g), inclusive, above, and the
provisions of Sections 2.01 (duration), 2.02 (terms of exercise), 3.02
(notice) and 3.03 (no adjustment for dividends), with respect to the
Warrant Shares, shall apply on like terms to such other securities.

(i) Upon the expiration of any rights, options, warrants or conversion
or exchange privileges, if any thereof shall not have been exercised, the
Warrant Price and the number of shares of MMI Common Stock purchasable 
upon the exercise of each Warrant shall, upon such expiration, be 
readjusted and shall thereafter be such as it would have been had it been
originally adjusted (or had the original adjustment not been required, as
the case may be) as if (i) the only shares of MMI Common Stock so issued 
were the shares of MMI Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold upon
the exercise of such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange 
rights and (ii) such shares of MMI Common Stock, if any, were issued or 
sold for the consideration actually received by MMI upon such exercise 
plus the aggregate consideration, if any, actually received by MMI for the
issuance, sale or grant of all such rights, options, warrants or 
conversion or exchange rights whether or not exercised; provided,
however, that no such readjustment shall have the effect of increasing the
Warrant Price or decreasing the number of shares of MMI Common Stock 
purchasable upon the exercise of each Warrant by an amount in excess of 
the amount of the adjustment initially made in respect to the issuance, 
sale or grant of such rights, options, warrants or conversion or exchange
rights.

3.02. Notice of Change in Shares Issuable, etc. Whenever the securities
issuable or deliverable in exchange for Warrant is changed pursuant to this
Article III, MMI promptly shall prepare a certificate executed by its chief
financial officer, setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring the
change and specifying the effective date of such change and the number or amount
of, and describing the shares or other securities issuable or deliverable in
exchange for, each Warrant as so changed. MMI shall mail such a notice to each
holder of Warrant at the address registered with MMI. Failure to file such
statement or to publish such notice, or any defect in such statement or notice,
shall not affect the legality or validity of any such change.

3.03. No Adjustment for Dividends. Except as provided in Section 3.01, no
adjustment in respect of any dividends shall be made during the term of a
Warrant or upon the exercise of a Warrant.

3.04. Form of Warrant. The form of Warrant need not be changed because of
any change in the amounts or nature of securities issuable or deliverable
pursuant to this Article III, and Warrants issued after such change may state
the same number of shares issuable in exchange for the Warrant as is stated in
the Warrant initially issued pursuant to this Agreement. However, MMI at any
time, in its sole discretion (which shall be conclusive), may change the form of
Warrant to reflect any such change in the amounts or nature of securities
issuable or deliverable upon exercise, provided such change in form does not
otherwise affect the substance thereof; and any Warrant thereafter issued or
countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant or
otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.

3.05. Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares. MMI shall not be required to
issue fractional shares of MMI Common Stock upon exercise of Warrants. If, by
reason of any change be made pursuant to this Article III, the holder of any
Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of any rights evidenced thereby, to
receive a fractional interest in a share, MMI, upon such exercise, shall
purchase such fractional interest for an amount in cash equal to the current
market price per share of MMI Common Stock (as defined in Section 3.01(d)) on
the trading day immediately preceding the date the Warrant is presented for
exercise multiplied by such fractional interest.

ARTICLE IV

PRESERVATION OF PURCHASE RIGHTS UPON MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, ETC.

In case of any consolidation of MMI with or merger of MMI into another
corporation or in case of any sale, transfer or lease to another corporation of
all or substantially all the property of MMI, MMI or such surviving or
purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with each holder of
Warrants an agreement that each holder shall have the right thereafter upon
payment of the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such action to
purchase upon exercise of each Warrant the kind and amount of shares and other
securities, cash and property which the holder would have owned or would have
been entitled to receive after the happening of such consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer or lease had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to
such action; provided, however, that no adjustment in respect of dividends,
interest or other income on or from such shares or other securities, cash and
property shall be made during the term of a Warrant or upon the exercise of a
Warrant. Such agreement shall provide for adjustments, which shall be as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in Article 
III. The provisions of this Article IV shall similarly apply to successive 
consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or leases.

ARTICLE V

OTHER PROVISIONS FOR PROTECTION OF WARRANT HOLDERS

5.01. Reservation of Shares. MMI at all times shall reserve and keep
available such number of shares of its authorized but unissued MMI Common Stock
as from time to time shall be sufficient to permit the exercise of all
outstanding Warrants. If at any time the number of authorized but unissued
shares of MMI Common Stock shall not be sufficient for such purpose, MMI will
take such action as, in the opinion of its counsel, may be necessary to 
increase its authorized but unissued MMI Common Stock to such number of shares
as shall be sufficient for such purpose. Prior to the issuance of any Warrant
Shares, MMI shall secure the listing of such Warrant Shares upon any securities
exchange upon which shares of Common Stock are then listed, if any.

5.02. Lost and Misplaced Warrant Certificates. If any Warrant becomes
lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, MMI, on such terms as to indemnity or
otherwise as it may in its discretion impose, will issue a new Warrant of like
denomination, tenor and date as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed. Any such new Warrant shall constitute an original contractual
obligation of MMI, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed Warrant shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.

5.03. Enforcement of Warrant Rights. All rights of action are vested in
the respective holders of the Warrant. Any holder of any Warrant may, in his
own behalf and for his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any
suit, action or proceeding against MMI suitable to enforce, or otherwise in
respect of, his right to exercise his Warrant for the purchase of the number of
Warrant Shares issuable or deliverable in exchange therefor, in the manner
provided in the Warrant and in this Agreement.

5.04. Notice of Distributions. Whenever MMI shall authorize the payment
or distribution of a cash or other dividend to all holders of the MMI Common
Stock which does not require an adjustment to the Warrant pursuant to
Subsections (a), (b) or (c) of Section 3.01 hereof, then MMI will cause to be
mailed to the holder of the Warrant by first class mail addressed to such holder
at the address appearing in the records of MMI, at least 10 days before the
applicable record date with respect to such dividend or distribution, a notice
stating (A) the date on which record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend or distribution, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of
which the holders of MMI Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend
or distribution are to be determined and (B) a brief description of the kind and
aggregate amount of such dividend or distribution, including, if available, the
amount thereof on a per share of MMI Common Stock basis.

ARTICLE VI

TRANSFER AND OWNERSHIP OF WARRANT

6.01. Negotiability and Ownership. Any Warrant issued hereunder shall not
be sold, transferred, assigned or hypothecated or in any manner transferred by
MEDIQ except in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any
applicable state securities laws. Any attempt to sell, transfer, assign or
hypothecate in contravention of this Section shall be null and void.

6.02. Exchange of Warrant. Upon the issuance and prior to the expiration
thereof, one or more Warrant may be surrendered at the office MMI for exchange
and, upon cancellation thereof, one or more new Warrant shall be issued as
requested by the holder of the cancelled Warrant or Warrants for the same
aggregate number of shares as were issuable in exchange for the Warrant or
Warrants so cancelled.

ARTICLE VII

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

regard to the choice of law rules thereof.

THIS NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT (the 'Agreement') is made and entered into as
of [ ], 1994, by and between MMI Medical, Inc., a California
corporation ('MMI'), MEDIQ Equipment and Maintenance Services, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ('MEDIQ Sub') and MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
('MEDIQ').

RECITALS

WHEREAS, MEDIQ has this date conveyed to MMI, all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of MEDIQ Sub pursuant to that certain Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization among MMI, MMI Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc. ('MMI Sub'),
MEDIQ Sub and MEDIQ (the 'Reorganization Agreement');

WHEREAS, upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the
Reorganization Agreement, MMI Sub merged with and into MEDIQ Sub with MMI
holding all of the outstanding capital stock of MEDIQ Sub as the 'surviving
corporation' (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement);

WHEREAS, the business of MEDIQ Sub as currently conducted, including
without limitation the business of providing repair and maintenance services,
and sales of parts for, and management of the technical operation of, CT
scanners, nuclear medicine equipment, magnetic resonance imaging
systems and other diagnostic imaging equipment for hospitals and mobile and
fixed-site operators (the 'Business') has heretofore been conducted in the
Territory (as defined below);

WHEREAS, MMI through MEDIQ Sub intends to carry on the Business;

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 7.8 of the Reorganization Agreement, MEDIQ has
agreed to enter into a noncompetition agreement in favor of MMI and the
surviving corporation;

WHEREAS, if MEDIQ were to compete with MMI's operation of the Business in
the Territory through the surviving corporation other than as permitted herein,
MMI could be deprived of the benefit of any reputation or goodwill of the
surviving corporation as may exist after the date hereof; and

WHEREAS, the covenants provided herein are material, significant and
essential to effecting the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization
Agreement, and the Noncompetition Shares (defined below) and the consideration
under the Reorganization Agreement has been transferred from MMI to MEDIQ in
exchange for such covenants.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the sum of 20,000 shares (the
'Noncompetition Shares') of MMI Common Stock, as that term is defined in the
Reorganization Agreement, and the premises and of the respective representations
and warranties contained herein and the respective covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement and to induce MMI
to perform its obligations thereunder, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of the
Closing, as that term is defined in the Reorganization Agreement, and shall
terminate on the fifth anniversary of the date of the Closing,
except that the covenant set forth in Section 2(c) shall terminate on the third
anniversary of the date of the Closing.

2. Covenant Not to Compete. For the term of this Agreement, MEDIQ shall
not, directly or indirectly:

(a) engage in the Business or any business competing with the
Business;

(b) have any interest in, own, manage, operate, control, be connected
with as a stockholder (other than as a stockholder of less than one percent
(1%) of the issued and outstanding stock of a publicly held corporation),
joint venturer, officer, partner, employee or consultant, or otherwise
engage or invest or participate in the Business or any business which shall
compete with the Business conducted by the surviving corporation or any
successor of the surviving corporation in the Territory; or

(c) solicit any then current employee of the surviving corporation to
leave the employ of the surviving corporation.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, MEDIQ shall not be restricted from
repairing or maintaining (directly or indirectly through subsidiaries)
nuclear medicine equipment in conjunction with MEDIQ Sub's business of
providing nuclear medicine and ultrasound services, so long as MEDIQ does
not bid for nuclear medicine equipment maintenance contracts currently held
by MMI when such contracts are renewed.

3. Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto agree that damages would be an
inadequate remedy for MMI or the surviving corporation in the event of breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement and thus, in any such event, MMI or the
surviving corporation may, either with or without pursuing any potential damage
remedies, immediately obtain and enforce an injunction prohibiting MEDIQ from
violating this Agreement.

4. Territory. For purposes of this Agreement, 'Territory' means the
Business carried on by the surviving corporation in those counties in the
respective states listed on Schedule 1.

5. Enforceability. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that
the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. Accordingly, if any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated to
be invalid or unenforceable, such provision, without any action on the part of
the parties hereto, shall be deemed amended to delete or to modify (including,
without limitation, a reduction in duration, geographical area or prohibited
business activities) the portion adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable,
such deletion or modification to apply only with respect to the operation of
such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is
made, and such deletion or modification to be made only to the extent necessary
to cause the provision as amended to be valid and enforceable.

6. Noncompetition Shares. As an inducement to MEDIQ to enter into this
Agreement, MMI represents and warrants that (a) the Noncompetition Shares which
are to be transferred to MEDIQ by MMI pursuant hereto are free and clear of any
and all Encumbrances (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement); (b) MMI has
the full right, power and authority to issue and transfer the Noncompetition
Shares to MEDIQ pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and (c) the
Noncompetition Shares to be issued to MEDIQ as contemplated hereunder are duly
authorized and, when issued pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable, not subject to any
preemptive or similar rights.

7. Amendment; Beneficiary; Termination. This Agreement may be amended
only by a written instrument signed by each of the parties hereto. Nothing in 
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any third person
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement 
may be terminated only upon the written agreement of MMI, the surviving 
corporation and MEDIQ. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall 
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly 
provided.

8. Complete Understanding. This Agreement constitutes the full and
complete understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and
agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof.

9. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, applications, services of
process, and other communications required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by telex,
