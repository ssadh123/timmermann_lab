CHEVRON ANNOUNCES SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH IRS

SAN FRANCISCO, August 3 -- Chevron Corporation announced that it has reached a
settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service that substantially
resolves all open tax issues for the nine years 1979 through 1987.

Details of the settlement are subject to a confidentiality agreement. However,
Chevron's net expenditure for the settlement will be approximately $550
million after taking into account the tax deductibility of the interest
portion. The agreed adjustments increase the company's total U.S. Federal tax
payments for this nine-year period by about 10 percent. Because of the
substantial time period involved, the majority of the settlement amount
represents net interest on these adjustments. Reserves, primarily interest,
established in prior years for the contested issues significantly exceed the
amount of the total payment.

"We're very pleased with this outcome," noted Chevron Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Ken Derr. "Although we'll be paying out a sizable amount
for the settlement, our reserve will more than offset that. More important,
we're putting nearly a decade of open issues behind us. This settlement moves
us strongly toward our goal of becoming current in our tax audits and
resolving all tax issues in a timely manner."

The settlement resolves many significant issues, such as the appropriate
treatment of shipping demurrage, intercompany interest and services, crude and
product pricing, offshore insurance operations, the sale of Chevron's European
downstream operations, and numerous domestic oil and gas issues.

The settlement also resolves the so-called "Aramco Advantage" issue, which
was the subject of a 1993 Tax Court decision in favor of other former Arabian
American Oil Company shareholders Exxon Corporation and Texaco Inc.

The agreement leaves two issues open for further resolution. First, in
February 1994, a Tax Court trial was held to determine what method Chevron
should use in 1977 - 1978 to allocate state income taxes in determining
allowable foreign tax credits. The decision in that case will be applied to
the subsequent years. Second, the IRS is reviewing the creditability of
income taxes paid by Chevron affiliates to the Government of Indonesia.
