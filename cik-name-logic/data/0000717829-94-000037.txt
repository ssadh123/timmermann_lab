FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CINCINNATI, OHIO, December 6, 1994 -- Gibson Greetings, Inc. (NASDAQ:GIBG)
said that its customer F&M Distributors, Inc. (F&M) today announced that
it had filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. F&M
represented less than 3% of Gibson's revenues in 1993.

F&M has stated that it will continue to operate while it develops a
reorganization plan.

As of October 31, 1994 Gibson's books reflected approximately $7.7 million
of outstanding F&M trade receivables, approximately $2.6 million of fixtures
located in F&M stores and approximately $6.3 million of deferred costs
relating to a long-term F&M sales agreement. Gibson's accounting treatment
of these various items will depend upon future developments at F&M. Gibson
noted that at this time it is too early to speculate about possible changes
in its sales volume as the result of F&M's actions.

While it is not possible without additional information to accurately determine
the impact on earnings for its fourth quarter ending December 31, 1994,
Gibson expects to record a significant charge against its earnings to reflect
the exposure resulting from the F&M bankruptcy filing.
