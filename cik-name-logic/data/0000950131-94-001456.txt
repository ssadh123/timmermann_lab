ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On September 9, 1994, Maxus Energy Corporation sold its geothermal subsidiary,
Thermal Power Company ("TPC"), to Calpine Corporation for $60 million in cash
and a note receivable for $6.5 million payable in three years.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

(B) PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

An unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 has been prepared as if
the TPC divestiture had occurred at that date. The effect of other previously
reported divestitures during 1994, which includes the sale of certain producing
oil and gas properties in Maxus' Southern Division owned directly by Maxus and
the sale by Maxus and its subsidiaries of its general partners' interests and
units of limited partnership interests in Diamond Shamrock Offshore Partners
Limited Partnership ("DSP") to affiliates of Burlington Resources Inc., is
reflected in the historical financial data presented in the unaudited pro forma
balance sheet as of June 30, 1994. The unaudited pro forma statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended June
30, 1994 have been prepared as if all such divestitures had occurred at January
1, 1993 and January 1, 1994, respectively, after giving effect to the pro forma
financial adjustments described in Notes 1 and 2. The pro forma data are not
necessarily indicative of the financial results which would have occurred had
the divestitures been effective on those dates and should not be viewed as
indicative of the financial results of Maxus in future periods.
