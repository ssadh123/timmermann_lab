Item 5. Other Events

On September 22, 1994, Food Lion (the "Company") announced
the appointment of Margaret Kluttz to it Board of Directors. Mrs.
Kluttz has served as Mayor of the City of Salisbury since 1991, on
the North Carolina Board of Transportation since 1993 and was
recently named to chair the North Carolina Rail Commission. She
replaced Dan A. Boone, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, who
voluntarily resigned as a member of the Board to complete Food
Lion's plan to increase the number of directors on the Board not
affiliated with Food Lion or Etablissements Delhaize Freres et Ce
"Le Lion" S.A. ("Delhaize `Le Lion'") and as further reflected in
the provisions of a new shareholders agreement ("1994 Shareholders
Agreement" or "Agreement"), described further below. Mr. Boone
will continue as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and
advisor to the Board.

The 1994 Shareholders Agreement among Delhaize "Le Lion,"
Delhaize The Lion America, Inc. ("Detla") and the Company
supersedes a previous Shareholders Agreement entered into in 1988.
Section 1 of the 1994 Shareholders Agreement provides for a
Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors for the purpose of
nominating the slate of directors to be submitted to the
shareholders for election to the Board and filling any vacancy
that may arise from time to time. The composition of the
Nominating Committee, of each slate of directors and the other
responsibilities of the Nominating Committee are set forth in the
Agreement. Section 2 of the Agreement reflects a voting agreement
between Delhaize and Detla with respect to the election of
directors of the Company and related matters.

Section 3 of the 1994 Shareholders Agreement provides, among
other things, that the By-Laws of the Company shall be modified so
as to require an affirmative vote of at least 70 percent of the
directors to approve certain actions, including to elect a chief
executive officer other than Tom Smith, sell or otherwise dispose
of a substantial part of the Company's assets other than in the
ordinary course of business, and for the merger or consolidation
of the Company with and into any other corporation. Until the
required shareholders vote is obtained to render such provision
effective, subparagraph 3(a) of the 1988 Shareholders Agreement
remains in full force and effect. The foregoing description of
the Shareholders Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the
Agreement itself which is attached hereto as an exhibit.

Board of Directors. The Shareholders and the Company recognize
that they have had a mutually beneficial relationship of

other past and present management shareholders of the Company) and
believe that the continuation of such relationship on a long-term
basis is in the best interest of the Company. The Shareholders
and the Company further recognize that provision must be made for

AGREEMENT

1. Nomination and Election of Directors. Subject
to the fiduciary duties of directors under North Carolina law or
except as the Board of Directors of the Company by Special Vote
(as defined in subparagraph 3(b) below) shall otherwise direct:

(a) The Company's Board of Directors shall
establish a Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors for the
purpose of nominating the slate of directors to be submitted to
the shareholders for election at the annual meeting or any meeting
of the shareholders at which a director or directors are to be
elected and filling any vacancies that may arise from time to
time. The composition of the Nominating Committee, the
composition of each slate of directors to be nominated and the
other responsibilities of the Nominating Committee shall be as set
forth below:

(i) The Nominating Committee shall
consist of three directors, one of whom shall have
been designated by the Shareholders, one of whom shall
be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his
designee from among the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company) and one of whom shall be an
independent director;

(ii) The slate of directors nominated
by the Nominating Committee shall consist of ten (10)
persons, four (4) of whom shall have been proposed by
the Chief Executive Officer of Delhaize (hereinafter
the "Delhaize Designees"), two (2) of whom shall have
been proposed by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company (hereinafter the "CEO Designees") and four (4)
of whom shall be independent directors;

(iii) In the event that any director
ceases to be a director of the Company, then the
Nominating Committee shall nominate an appropriate
person to fill such vacancy, selected in the same
manner as the director who ceased being director.
Thus, in the event a Delhaize Designee ceases to be a
director, the vacancy left thereby shall be filled by

-2-
a new Delhaize Designee, in the event a CEO Designee
ceases to be a director, the vacancy left thereby
shall be filled by a new CEO Designee, and in the
event an independent director ceases to be a director,
the vacancy left thereby shall be filled by a new
independent director.

(iv) The Nominating Committee shall
meet at least once a year to determine the proposed
slate of directors to be submitted to the annual
meeting of shareholders for election. In addition, it
shall meet each time a meeting of the shareholders is
called for the purpose of electing one or more
directors. It shall also meet within thirty (30) days
of notice of any vacancy occurring in the Board of
Directors to nominate a director to fill such vacancy.
It may solicit the views of other Shareholders of the
Company for suggestions with regard to possible
independent directors. It will assess the
independence of each such candidate (which shall at a
minimum require that the candidate not be currently or
previously employed, nor currently paid as a
consultant, by the Company or its affiliates or
officers or by either of the Shareholders or their
respective affiliates or officers) and will consider
any other potential for conflict of interest of each
such candidate. It will determine the appropriate
qualifications for directorship and will evaluate
candidates against the requisite qualifications;

(v) The Nominating Committee shall
recommend its slate of directors or any individual
nominee to the Board of Directors of the Company.
Approval of any such nomination(s) by the Board of
Directors shall be by Special Vote. In the event that
the Board of Directors fails to approve a slate or
any individual nominee proposed by the Nominating
Committee, the Nominating Committee shall meet to
propose another slate, or nominee, as the case may be,
acceptable to the Board of Directors; and

-3-
(vi) Meetings of the Nominating
Committee shall be held at such place as may from time
to time be fixed by the Chairman thereof in the Notice
of Meeting. Any meeting may be held without notice if
all members are present or if notice is waived in
writing either before or after the meeting by those
not present. Two members of the Nominating Committee
shall constitute a quorum and all decisions of the
Nominating Committee shall require the affirmative
vote of at least two members. The Nominating
Committee may take action without a meeting upon
unanimous written consent signed by all members of the
Nominating Committee. Meetings of the Nominating
Committee may be held by means of conference telephone
or similar communications equipment and participation
in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person
at such meeting.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this
paragraph 1 to the contrary, if at any time it is determined that
the composition of the Company's Board of Directors does not
comply with applicable corporate governance rules contained in
Part III, Section 5(c), of Schedule D to the By-Laws of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or similar rules
of any national securities exchange on which the Company's
securities may be listed (the "Requirement"), the Nominating
Committee shall meet to determine the action necessary to comply
with the Requirement and shall recommend such action, including
the nomination of an additional director or additional directors
and the removal of any director or directors. The Board of
Directors, by Special Vote (as defined in subparagraph 3(b)
below), shall take such actions as are necessary to comply with
the Requirement, but which to the extent possible shall be
consistent with the intentions of the parties as set forth in this
Agreement.

2. Voting Agreement. At each election of directors of the
Company, the Shareholders shall vote their voting shares as
follows:

-4-
(i) In the event cumulative voting is
not in effect for such election, to elect the slate of
directors proposed by the Nominating Committee and
approved by the Board of Directors; and

(ii) In the event cumulative voting is
in effect for such election of directors, first, to
the extent necessary, to elect the Delhaize Designees
and thereafter to retain or remove any such Delhaize
Designees as the Shareholders shall direct; second, to
the extent possible, to elect the CEO Designees and
thereafter to retain or remove any such CEO Designees
as the CEO shall direct; and third, to the extent
possible, to elect the independent directors nominated
by the Committee and thereafter to retain or remove
any such independent directors as the Committee shall
direct. The Shareholders agree not to participate,
directly or indirectly, in any effort to cause
cumulative voting to be in effect for any election of
directors of the Company.

established pursuant to Article 5, Section 2 of the By-Laws of the
Company shall be abolished and such By-Law provision shall be
