Item 5. Other Events

On August 17, the Company announced its decision not to seek renewal of
its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to continue to
manage its nuclear facility at Rocky Flats in Colorado. On August 25,
the Company announced it will not compete as a prime contractor to
manage the DOE's facility at the Nevada Test Site. The Company 
presently holds two contracts there through its subsidiaries Energy
Measurements, Inc. and Reynolds Electrical & Engineering Company. These
announcements are consistent with a re-examination of the Company's
varied business segments as the Company redeploys its resources to more
attractive business opportunities.

The current contracts to manage both facilities expire December 31,
1995. The Company intends to continue to meet its obligations under the
terms and conditions of its present contracts.
