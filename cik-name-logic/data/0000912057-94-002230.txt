DEBT SECURITIES

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

June 23, 1994

To the Representatives of the
several Underwriters to be named in the
respective Pricing Agreements
hereinafter described.

Dear Sirs:

From time to time Protective Life Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing
Agreements in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as
the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions
stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to
the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters"
with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein)
certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to
such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated
Securities").

The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated
Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and
in or pursuant to the indenture (such indenture, including any supplement
thereto relating to the Designated Securities, the "Indenture") identified in
such Pricing Agreement.

1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time
to time to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, for whom the firms
designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities
in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the
"Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm
acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act
without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting
Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of
the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the
Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the
Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the
Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the
Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify
the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public
offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the
Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of
such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such
Underwriters and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be
purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of
delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing
Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and
the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of
such

<PAGE>

Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed
writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of
telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to
produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the
Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several
and not joint.

2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of
the Underwriters that:

(a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 33-52831) in
respect of the Securities and Preferred Stock of the Company and the
Preferred Securities of PLC Capital L.L.C., a limited liability company
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, (collectively, the
"Registered Securities") has been filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statement and any
post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or
to be delivered to the Representatives and, excluding exhibits to such
registration statement, but including all documents incorporated by
reference in the prospectus contained therein, to the Representatives for
delivery to each of the other Underwriters, have been declared effective
by the Commission in such form; no other document with respect to such
registration statement or document incorporated by reference therein has
heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission; and
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement
has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or
threatened by the Commission (any preliminary prospectus included in such
registration statement or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), being hereinafter called a
"Preliminary Prospectus"; the various parts of such registration
statement, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated
by reference in the prospectus contained in the registration statement at
the time such part of the registration statement become effective but
excluding any Forms T-1 and, if applicable, including the information
contained in the form of final prospectus filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a)
hereof and deemed by virtue of Rule 430A under the Act to be a part of
such registration statement at effectiveness, each as amended at the time
such part of the registration statement become effective, being
hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"; the prospectus
(including, if applicable, any prospectus supplement) relating to the
Registered Securities, in the form in which it has most recently been
filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, being hereinafter called the "Prospectus"; any
reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be
deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference
therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of
such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any
reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or
the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed
with the Commission after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or
Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such
Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to
any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to
and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the
Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement; and any reference to the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in the
form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)
under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof, including any
documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such
filing);

2
<PAGE>

(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when
they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement
thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the
Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to
the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty
shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and
in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an
Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly
for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such
Securities;

(c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any
further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of
the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust
Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the
Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable
filing date as to the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto,
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not misleading and
(ii) in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that this
representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions
made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Securities through
the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented relating to such Securities;

(d) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been (i) any
material change in the capital stock or any increase in the long-term debt
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in excess of $9 million, (ii)
any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective
material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management,
financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (iii) any reduction in
the statutory capital or surplus of the Company's subsidiaries engaged in
the business of insurance (each an "Insurance Subsidiary," and
collectively, the "Insurance Subsidiaries"), taken as a whole in excess of
$9 million, in each case otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in
the Prospectus;

(e) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing
as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and
conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and has been duly
qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business under
the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties,
or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, or is
subject to no material liability or disability by reason of the failure to
be so qualified in any such jurisdiction;

3
<PAGE>

(f) Protective Life Insurance Company ("Protective Life Insurance")
has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with
power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and
conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and has been duly
qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is
in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it

reason of the failure to be so qualified in any such jurisdiction;

(g) Protective Life Insurance is duly organized and licensed as an
insurance company in its state of incorporation and is duly licensed or
authorized as an insurer in each other jurisdiction where it is required
to be so licensed or authorized to conduct its business as described in
the Prospectus, except for any such jurisdiction in which the failure to
be so licensed or authorized would not have a material adverse effort on
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole; and except as otherwise
specifically described in the Prospectus, neither the Company nor
Protective Life Insurance has received any notification from any insurance
regulatory authority to the effect that any additional authorization,
approval, order, consent, license, certificate, permit, registration or
qualification from such insurance regulatory authority is needed to be
obtained by either of the Company or Protective Life Insurance in any case
where it could be reasonably expected that the failure to obtain any such
additional authorization, approval, order, consent, license, certificate,
permit, registration or qualification would have a material adverse effect
on the business, financial position or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries, considered as a whole;

(h) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and all of the issued shares of
capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and
issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and conform in all material
respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus; and all
of the issued shares of capital stock of Protective Life Insurance have
been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and
non-assessable and (except for directors' qualifying shares) are owned

encumbrances, equities or claims;

(i) The Securities have been duly authorized, and, when Designated
Securities are issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the
Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities, such
Designated Securities will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued
and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, which will
be substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement; the Indenture has been duly authorized and duly qualified under

terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the
Indenture conforms, and the Designated Securities will conform, to the
descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented with respect to such Designated Securities;

(j) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the
Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, this
Agreement and any Pricing Agreement, and the consummation of the
transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (1) conflict with or
result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a

4
<PAGE>

default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or
other agreement or instrument to which the Company or Protective Life
Insurance is a party or by which the Company or Protective Life Insurance
is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or
Protective Life Insurance is subject, except, in all such cases, for such
conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and Protective Life Insurance taken as a whole or would not affect
the validity of or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the
issuance or sale of the Designated Securities or (2) result in any
violation of the provisions of (A) the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws of the Company or Protective Life Insurance or (B) any statute or
any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory
authority or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over
the Company or Protective Life Insurance or any of their properties;
provided, however that in the case of clause (B) of this paragraph 2(j),
this representation and warranty shall not extend to such violations as
would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and Protective Life Insurance taken
as a whole or would not affect the validity of or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on the issuance or sale of the Designated
Securities; provided further, that insofar as this representation and
warranty relates to the performance by the Company of its obligations
under this Agreement, the Pricing Agreement or the Indenture relating to
the Designated Securities, such performance is subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity principles; and no consent, approval, authorization,
order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or
insurance regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body having
jurisdiction over the Company or Protective Life Insurance is required for
the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Pricing Agreement
or the Indenture, except such as have been, or will have been prior to the
Time of Delivery, obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and
such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or
qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws
or insurance securities laws in connection with the purchase and
distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and except those which,
if not obtained, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and Protective Life
Insurance taken as a whole or would not affect the validity of or
otherwise have a material adverse effect on the issuance or sale of the
Designated Securities;

(k) Other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, there
are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity (if
applicable), total surplus (if applicable) or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by
governmental authorities or threatened by others; and

3. Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any
Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of
such Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer such
Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented.

4. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Agreement,
global certificates for Designated Securities to be purchased by each
Underwriter pursuant to such Pricing Agreement, registered in the name Cede &
Co., shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to The Depository Trust
Company, which shall release such Designated Securities to the accounts of the

5
<PAGE>

Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such
Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by certified or
official bank check or checks, payable to the order of the Company or, if so
requested by the Company, by wire transfer to a bank account specified by the
Company and described in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement, in the funds
specified in such Pricing Agreement, all at the place and time and date
specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as
the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and
date being herein called the "Time of Delivery" for such Securities.

5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any
Designated Securities:

(a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in
relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the
Representatives (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld) and to
file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than
the Commission's close of business on the second business day following
the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such other time as may
be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement
to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented
after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and
prior to the Time of Delivery for such Securities which shall be
reasonably disapproved by the Representatives for such Securities promptly
after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of
any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery and furnish
the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and
any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the
Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is
required in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities, and
during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the
Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any
supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with
the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of
any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to
the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Securities
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening
of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the
Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement
or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the
issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or
suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or
suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to
obtain its withdrawal;

(b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the
Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Securities for
offering and sale under the securities laws of such United States
jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably request and to comply
with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings
therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete
the distribution of such Securities, provided that in connection therewith
the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or
to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction and
provided further that in connection therewith the Company shall not be
required to qualify such Designated Securities for offering and sale under
the securities laws of any such jurisdiction for a period in excess of
nine months after the initial time of issue of the Prospectus as amended
or supplemented relating to such Designated Securities;

(c) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from
time to time reasonably

6
<PAGE>

request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in
connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time
any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then
amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for
any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or
supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the
Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the
Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to
prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer
in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time
reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the
Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such
compliance, provided, however, that in case any Underwriter is required
under the Act to deliver a prospectus in connection with the offering or
sale of the Designated Securities at any time more than nine months after
the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities,
the costs of such preparation and furnishing of such amended or
supplemented Prospectus shall be borne by the Underwriters of such
Designated Securities;

(d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as
practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the
effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c)),
an earning statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not
be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (including at the option of the
Company Rule 158); and

(e) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing
Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including
the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such
Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives
and (ii) the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, not to
offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities
of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery
and which are substantially similar to such Designated Securities, without
the prior written consent of the Representatives.

6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters
that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees,
disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in
connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other
expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the
Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and, subject to the proviso
to Section 5(c), the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the
mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii)
the cost of producing and printing or duplicating any Agreement among
Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Indenture, any Blue Sky
and Legal Investment Memoranda and any other documents in connection with the
offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in
connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under
state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection
with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment
surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the
Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to any required review by the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the
Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the cost of
qualifying the Securities with the Depository Trust Company (if applicable);
(viii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee and any agent of any Trustee and the
fees and disbursements of counsel for any Trustee in connection with any
Indenture and the Securities; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to
the performance of its obligations

7
<PAGE>

hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It
is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 8 and
Section 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and
expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any
of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any
offers they may make.

7. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities
under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be
subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all
representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or
incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated
Securities are, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have

amended or supplemented and other related matters as the Representatives
may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers
and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon
such matters;

(c) Deborah J. Long, Esq., Senior Vice President and General Counsel
of the Company, or any successor having substantially equivalent
responsibilities with the Company, shall have furnished to the
Representatives such counsel's written opinion, dated each Time of
Delivery for such Designated Securities, respectively, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:

(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, with power and authority (corporate and other) to
own its properties and conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and has been duly qualified
as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in
good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it
owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to
require such qualification, or is subject to no material liability
or disability by reason of the failure to be so qualified in any
such jurisdiction;

(ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set
forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and all of the
issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and
validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and
conform in all material respects to the description thereof in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented; and all of the issued shares
of capital stock of Protective Life Insurance have been duly and
validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and
(except for directors' qualifying shares) are owned directly

<PAGE>

or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of any perfected
security interests and, to such counsel's best knowledge, any other
security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances;

(iii) The issue and sale of the Designated Securities being
delivered at such Time of Delivery and the compliance by the Company
with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the
Indenture, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated
will not (i) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any
of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other
agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company
or Protective Life Insurance is a party or by which the Company or
Protective Life Insurance is bound or to which any of the property
or assets of the Company or Protective Life Insurance is subject,
except, in all such cases, for such conflicts, breaches, violations
or defaults as would not have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of the Company and Protective Life Insurance
taken as a whole or would not have a material adverse effect on the
issuance or sale of the Designated Securities, or (ii) result in any
violation of the provisions of (A) the Certificate of Incorporation
or By-Laws of the Company or Protective Life Insurance or (B) any
statute known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or
Protective Life Insurance or any of their respective properties, or
any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or
insurance regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body
having jurisdiction over the Company or Protective Life Insurance or
any of their respective properties, except, with respect to clause
(B) of this paragraph (iii), such violations as would not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and Protective Life Insurance taken as a
whole or would not affect the validity of or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on the issuance or sale of the Designated
Securities; and except that for purposes of this paragraph (iii)
such counsel need not express any opinion as to any violation of any
federal or state securities laws or Blue Sky or insurance securities
laws; provided further, that insofar as performance by the Company
of its obligations under the Indenture, this Agreement and the
Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities is
concerned, such counsel need not express any opinion as to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and as to
general equity principles;

(iv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, no consent,
approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or
with any court or insurance regulatory authority or other
governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is required for the issue and sale of the
Designated Securities being delivered at such Time of Delivery or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, the Designated Securities or
the Indenture, except such as have been, or will have been prior to
each Time of Delivery, obtained under the Act, the Trust Indenture
Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders,
registrations or qualifications as may be required under state
securities or Blue Sky laws or insurance securities laws in
connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated
Securities by the Underwriters, and except those which, if not
obtained, would not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operation of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole;

9
<PAGE>

(v) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no
legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject of a character
required under the Federal securities laws to be disclosed in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus which are not adequately
disclosed in the Registration Statement or Prospectus;

(vi) The documents incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial
statements and related notes, the financial statement schedules and
other financial and statistical data included therein as to which
such counsel need express no opinion), when they become effective or
were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of
the Commission thereunder;

In rendering the opinion required by subsection (c) of this Section, (i)
such counsel may state that she is admitted to the Bar of the State of Alabama
only, and (ii) such counsel may rely (A) as to any matter to which you consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), to the extent specified in
such opinion, upon the opinions (copies of which shall have been provided to the
Representatives) of other counsel in good standing whom such counsel believes to
be reliable, provided that such counsel shall state that she believes that both
she and the Representatives are justified in relying on such opinions and (B) as
to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers and representatives of the
Company and of public officials (copies of which shall have been provided to the
Representatives), provided that such counsel shall state that she believes that
both she and the Representatives are justified in relying upon such
certificates.

Such counsel shall also have stated that, while she has not herself
checked the accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified, and is not
passing upon and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of,
the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, in the
course of her review and discussion of the contents of the Registration
Statement and Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto with certain
officers and employees of the Company and its independent accountants, but
without independent check or verification, no facts have come to her attention
that would cause her to believe that the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as of the date of the Pricing Agreement
with respect to the Designated Securities and the Time of Delivery for such
Designated Securities (other than the financial statements and related notes,
the financial statement schedules, other financial and statistical data included
therein and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 under the
Trust Indenture Act as to which she need express no opinion) contained or
contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(d) Debevoise & Plimpton, or other counsel for the Company
satisfactory to the Representatives, shall have furnished to the
Representatives their written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such
Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Representatives, to the effect that:

(i) The Designated Securities have been duly authorized,
issued, executed, authenticated and delivered and constitute valid
and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the
benefits provided by the Indenture, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general
equity principles

10
<PAGE>

(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity); and the Designated Securities conform in all material
respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Securities;

(ii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Trustee, the Indenture constitutes a valid and
legally binding instrument enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general
equity principles (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity); the Indenture has been duly qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act; and the Indenture conforms in all material
respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Securities;

(iii) This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect
to the Designated Securities being delivered at such Time of
Delivery have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company;

(iv) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements
thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other
than the financial statements and related notes, the financial
statement schedules and other financial and statistical data
included therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion)
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder; and

(v) The statements contained in the Prospectus under the
caption "Description of Debt Securities of Protective Life" and the
corresponding sections and any section describing tax matters in any
prospectus supplement relating to the Designated Securities being
delivered at such Time of Delivery, insofar as such statements
constitute summaries of certain provisions of the documents or U.S.
tax laws referred to therein, fairly summarize the material
provisions of such documents or U.S. tax laws.

In rendering the foregoing opinion, Debevoise & Plimpton may state
that they express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and The
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Debevoise & Plimpton shall also have stated that, while they have
not themselves checked the accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified,
and are not passing upon and assume no responsibility for the accuracy or
completeness of, the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, except to the limited extent stated in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (v)
above, in the course of their review and discussion of the contents of the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus with certain officers and employees of
the Company and its independent accountants, but without independent check or
verification, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that would
cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus,
as amended or supplemented, as of the date of the Pricing Agreement with respect
to the Designated Securities and the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities (other than the financial statements and related notes, the financial
statement schedules, and other financial and statistical data included therein,
and except for the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 under the
Trust Indenture Act, as

11
<PAGE>

to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained or contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(e) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated
Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the
independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the
Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement, and a
letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth
in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of
Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably
request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;

(f) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any
change in the capital stock or any increase in the long-term debt of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development
involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs,
management, financial position, stockholders' equity, total surplus (if
applicable) or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries
(in the case of the Insurance Subsidiaries on either a GAAP or statutory
basis), otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described
above, is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse
as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public
offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in
the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

(g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in any rating
of the Company or Protective Life Insurance or the rating accorded the
Company's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard &
Poor's Corporation, A.M. Best Company, Inc. or Duff & Phelps Inc. and (ii)
no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under
surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, any such
rating;

(h) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following:
(i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally
on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial
banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York
State authorities; or (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities
involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a
National Emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in
this clause (iii) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the
delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner
contemplated by the Prospectus as amended and supplemented; and

(i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to
the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities
a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to
the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to
the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be
performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set
forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other
matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.

12
<PAGE>

8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any
preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (i) in the case of
the Registration Statement, not misleading and (ii) in the case of the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, or any other such prospectus, in light
of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse
each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or
claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage
or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary
Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement,
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to
the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter
of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities and provided,
further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the
indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any Preliminary
Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus supplement to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact such
Underwriter sold Designated Shares to a person as to whom it shall be
established that there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written
confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents
incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the
Act if such Underwriter failed to make reasonable efforts generally consistent
with the then prevailing industry practice to effect such delivery and the
Company has previously furnished copies thereof in sufficient quantities to such
Underwriter (or to the Representatives) and the loss, claim, damage or liability
of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material
fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus
supplement which was corrected in the Prospectus (excluding incorporated
documents) (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding incorporated
documents)).

(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may
become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement,
the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any
other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, not
misleading and (ii) in the case of the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented,
or any such prospectus, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was
made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other
prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use
therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending
any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

13
<PAGE>

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection
(a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such
action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who
shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the
indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such
subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in
each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event,
shall any indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (in addition to local counsel) separate from their own counsel for
all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but
related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters
of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated
Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect
thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately
preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified
party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such
relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and
the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with
the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the
one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting
expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and
commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand
or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro
rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this
subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending
any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection
(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities
underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public
exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been

14
<PAGE>

required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d)
to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting
obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend,
upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the
Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which
the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same
terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to
purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the
Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives
may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties
to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within
thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do
not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company
shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to
procure another party or other parties reasonably satisfactory to the
Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the
event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify
the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated
Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged
for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the
Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such
Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to
effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other
documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which
in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term
"Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted
under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a
party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.

(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of
the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains
unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of
the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each
non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated
Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement
relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each
non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the
principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to
purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been
made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability
for its default.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of
the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased
exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated

15
<PAGE>

Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not
exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting
Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities
shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting
Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company
and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and
contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a
defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations,
warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as
set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively,
pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on
behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the
Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and
shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section
9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter
with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement
except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other
reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as
provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the
Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the
Representatives, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel,
reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase,
sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be
under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated
Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.

12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the
Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such
Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any
statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or
given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any,
as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.

All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be
in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex
or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in
the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail,
telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the
Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice
to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by
mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set
forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such
Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the
Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or
agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon,
and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the
extent provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors
of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and
their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and
no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this
Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities
from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of
such purchase.

14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used
herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in
Washington, D.C. is open for business.

16
<PAGE>

15.THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any
one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Very truly yours,

published rules and regulations thereunder;

(ii) In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules (and, if applicable, prospective financial statements

incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules
and regulations;

(iii) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a
reading of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and other
information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the
minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by

applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those
statements;

II-1
<PAGE>

(D) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to
the date of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock,
increase in long-term debt, or any decreases in consolidated net
current assets or shareholder's equity of the Company and its
subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net sales or in the
total or per share amounts of income before extraordinary items or
of net income, or any increases in any items specified by the
Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the
latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus, except in all instances for changes, increases or
decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur
or which are described in such letter; and

(iv) In addition to the examination referred to in their report(s)
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited
procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures
referred to in paragraph (iii) above, they have carried out certain
specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts,
percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives
which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and
its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents
incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules
to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in
documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the
Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages
and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and
its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.

required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action

exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities therein described; or such facts may be
proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer

Bearer Security continues until (i) another such certificate or affidavit
bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced,
(ii) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person,
(iii) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered
Security or (iv) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The ownership

deems sufficient.

(d) The ownership of Registered Securities shall be proved by the
Register.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder
of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the
registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in
respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the
Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon

advance a record date for the determination of Holders of such series entitled
to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so, PROVIDED that
the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph
shall not apply with

15
<PAGE>

respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or
direction referred to in the next paragraph. If such a record date is fixed,
such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of
record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be
Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite
proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to
such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of
such record date; PROVIDED that no such authorization, agreement or consent by
the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become
effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months
after the record date.

(g) The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of
determining the Holders of any series entitled to join in the giving or making
of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred
to in Section 5.2, (iii) any direction referred to in Section 5.8 or (iv)
any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 5.9(2), in each case
with respect to Securities of such series. If such a record date is fixed
pursuant to this paragraph, the relevant action may be taken or given before or
after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business
on such record date shall be deemed to be holders of a series for the purposes
of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding
Securities of such series have authorized or agreed or consented to such action,
and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities of such series shall be computed
as of such record date; PROVIDED that no such action by Holders on such record
date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the
provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting
a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set
pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall
automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect),
and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any
action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding
Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly
after any record date is set pursuant to this

16
<PAGE>

paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such
record date and the proposed action by Holders to be given to the Company in
writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner
set forth in Section 1.6.

demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or

Section 1.6. NOTICE TO HOLDERS; WAIVER. Where this Indenture
provides for notice to Holders of any event, (i) if any of the Securities

thereof shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided)
if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each such Holder
affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Register, within the
time prescribed for the giving of such notice and, (ii) if any of the
Securities affected by such event are Bearer Securities, notice to the Holders

such Bearer Securities expressly provided) if published once in an Authorized
Newspaper in New York, New York, and in such other city or cities, if any, as
may be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the
failure to mail such notice, nor any

17
<PAGE>

defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the
sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered
Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities
given as provided herein. In any case where notice is given to Holders by
publication, neither the failure to publish such notice, nor any defect in any
notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to
other Holders of Bearer Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders
of Registered Securities given as provided herein. Any notice mailed to a
Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively deemed to have been
received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder actually receives such
notice.

If by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason
of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice as provided
above, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee
shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. If it
is impossible or, in the opinion of the Trustee, impracticable to give any
notice by publication in the manner herein required, then such publication in
lieu thereof as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute
a sufficient publication of such notice.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English
language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the
country of publication.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice
may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either
before or after the event, and such waiver shall be equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in
reliance upon such waiver.

or coupon other than a provision in the

interest need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made
on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force
and effect as if made on such date; PROVIDED that no interest shall accrue on
the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date,
Redemption Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the
case may be.

Section 2.3. SECURITIES IN GLOBAL FORM. If Securities of or
within a series are issuable in whole or in part in global form, any such
Security may provide that it shall represent the aggregate or specified amount
of Outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and may also
provide that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities represented thereby
may from time to time be reduced or increased to reflect exchanges. Any
endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount, or any increase
or decrease in the amount, or changes in the rights of Holders, of Outstanding
Securities represented thereby, shall be made in such manner and by such Person
or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered

endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in
writing but need not comply with Section 1.2 hereof and need not be accompanied
by an Opinion of Counsel.

The provisions of the last paragraph of Section 3.3 shall apply to
any Security in global form if such

21

Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to
the Trustee the Security in global form together with written instructions

Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of
Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated
by the last paragraph of Section 3.3.

DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS
A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY OR BY A NOMINEE

(c) All Securities of any one series and coupons, if any,

(d) If any of the terms of the Securities of any series are

Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the
delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth, or providing the manner for
determining, the terms of the Securities of such series, and an appropriate

issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof and any
Bearer Securities of a series shall be issuable in the denomination of $5,000
and any integral multiples thereof.

Section 3.3. EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING.
Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by two Officers. The
Company's seal shall be reproduced on the Securities. The signatures of any of
these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. The coupons, if
any, of Bearer Securities shall bear the facsimile signature of two Officers.

27
<PAGE>

Securities and coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of
individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind
the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to
hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or
did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

At any time and from time to time, the Company may deliver
Securities, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, of any series
executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a
Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the
Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such
Securities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case of Securities offered in a
Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities
from time to time in accordance with such other procedures (including, without
limitation, the receipt by the Trustee of oral or electronic instructions from
the Company or its duly authorized agents, promptly confirmed in writing)
acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified by or pursuant to a Company Order
delivered to the Trustee prior to the time of the first authentication of
Securities of such series.

If the form or terms of the Securities of a series have been
established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by
Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities and accepting the
additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities,
the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to section 315(a) through
(d) of the Trust Indenture Act) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an
Opinion of Counsel stating,

(1) if the forms of such Securities and any coupons have been
established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section
2.1, that such forms have been established in conformity with the
provisions of this Indenture;

(2) if the terms of such Securities and any coupons have been
established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section
3.1, that such terms have been, or in the case of Securities of a series
offered in a Periodic Offering, will be, established in conformity with
the provisions of this Indenture,

28
<PAGE>

subject in the case of Securities offered in a Periodic Offering, to any
conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel; and

(3) that such Securities together with any coupons appertaining
thereto, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the
Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such
Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations
of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general equity principles and
except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by (A) requirements
that a claim with respect to any Securities denominated other than in
Dollars (or a Foreign Currency or currency unit judgment in respect of
such claim) be converted into Dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on
a date determined pursuant to applicable law or (B) governmental
authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments in Foreign
Currencies or currency units or payments outside the United States.

Notwithstanding that such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee
shall have the right to decline to authenticate such Securities if, in the
written opinion of counsel to the Trustee (which counsel may be an employee of
the Trustee) reasonably acceptable to the Company, the issue of such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will adversely affect the Trustee's own rights,
duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the generality of the
foregoing, the Trustee will not be required to authenticate Securities
denominated in a Foreign Currency if the Trustee reasonably believes that it
would be unable to perform its duties with respect to such Securities.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the two
preceding paragraphs, if all of the Securities of any series are not to be
issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers'
Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order and
Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to the two preceding paragraphs
in connection with the authentication

29
<PAGE>

of each Security of such series if such documents, with appropriate
modifications to cover such future issuances, are delivered at or prior to the
authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be
issued.

With respect to Securities of a series offered in a Periodic
Offering, the Trustee may rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of
such Securities, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding
effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the other
documents delivered pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 3.1 and this Section, as
applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Securities of such
series.

If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.1 that the
Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in global form, then
the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section
and the Company Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one
or more Securities in global form that (i) shall represent and shall be
denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series to be represented by such Security or
Securities in global form, (ii) shall be registered, if a Registered Security,
in the name of the Depository for such Security or Securities in global form or
the nominee of such Depository, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to
such Depository or pursuant to such Depository's instruction and (iv) shall
bear the legends set forth in Section 2.4. and the terms of the Board Resolution
or supplemental indenture relating to such series.

Each Depository designated pursuant to Section 3.1 for a Registered
Security in global form must, at the time of its designation and at all times
while it serves as Depository, be a clearing agency registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and any other applicable statute or regulation.
The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if the Depository is so
registered. Each Depository shall enter into an agreement with the Trustee
governing the respective duties and rights of such Depository and the Trustee
with regard to Securities issued in global form.

Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its
authentication and each Bearer Security shall be

30
<PAGE>

dated as of the date specified as contemplated by Section 3.1.

No Security or coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any
benefits under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose until
authenticated by the manual signature of one of the authorized signatories of
the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent and no coupon shall be valid until the
Security to which it appertains has been so authenticated. Such signature upon
any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such
Security has been duly authenticated and delivered under this Indenture and is
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Except as permitted by Section 3.6
or 3.7, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security
unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured have been detached and
cancelled.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company,
and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as
provided in Section 3.9 together with a written statement (which need not comply
with Section 1.2 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating
that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all
purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall not be entitled to the benefits
of this Indenture.

Section 3.4. TEMPORARY SECURITIES. Pending the preparation of
definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute and, upon Company
Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities of such
series which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise
produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor and form,
with or without coupons, of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are
issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other
variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as
conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities and coupons, if
any. In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be
in global form, representing all or a portion of the Outstanding Securities of
such series.

31
<PAGE>

Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, each of
which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof, if temporary
Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive
Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After
preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of
such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon
surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of
the Company pursuant to Section 9.2 in a Place of Payment for such series,
without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or
more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured coupons
appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of
definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like
tenor; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be
delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and PROVIDED
FURTHER that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for
a temporary Bearer Security unless the Trustee shall have received from the
person entitled to receive the definitive Bearer Security a certificate
substantially in the form approved in or pursuant to the Board Resolutions
relating thereto and such delivery shall occur only outside the United States.
Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects
be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities
of such series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1.

Section 3.5. REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. The Company
shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or in any
office or agency to be maintained by the Company in accordance with Section 9.2
in a Place of Payment a register (the "Register") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the
registration of Registered Securities and the registration of transfers of
Registered Securities. The Register shall be in written form or any other form
capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. The
Trustee is hereby appointed "Registrar" for the purpose of registering
Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities as herein provided.

32
<PAGE>

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered
Security of any series at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section
9.2 in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee
or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series, of any
authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount containing
identical terms and provisions.

Bearer Securities or any coupons appertaining thereto shall be
transferable by delivery.

At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series
(except a Registered Security in global form) may be exchanged for other
Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of
a like aggregate principal amount containing identical terms and provisions,
upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office or
agency. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the
Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to
receive. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, Bearer
Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered Securities.

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, at the
option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of such series may be exchanged for
Registered Securities (if the Securities of such series are issuable in
registered form) or Bearer Securities (if Bearer Securities of such series are
issuable in more than one denomination and such exchanges are permitted by such
series) of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor
and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be
exchanged at any such office or agency, with all unmatured coupons and all
matured coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer
Security is unable to produce any such unmatured coupon or coupons or matured
coupon or coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer
Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the
Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons,
or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company
and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or

33
<PAGE>

indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent
harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any
Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a payment shall
have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such
payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except as otherwise provided in Section
9.2, interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of those coupons at an office or agency located outside the United
States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any Bearer Security of any
series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered
Security of the same series after the close of business at such office or agency
on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such
office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special
Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the
related date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be
surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or
proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such coupon is so
surrendered with such Bearer Security, such coupon shall be returned to the
person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest,
as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or
proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered
Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only
to the Holder of such coupon, when due in accordance with the provisions of this
Indenture.

Each Security issued in global form authenticated under this
Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depository designated for such
series or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depository or a nominee
thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Security issued in global form
shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture. Unless
otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to a series of
Securities or as otherwise provided herein, owners of beneficial interests in
Securities of such series represented by a Security issued in global form will
not be entitled to have Securities of such series registered in their names,
will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities of
such series in certificated form and will not be considered the holders thereof
for any purposes hereunder.

<PAGE>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and
until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in certificated form in
the circumstances described below, a Security in global form representing all or
a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred or exchanged
except as a whole by the Depository for such series to a nominee of such
Depository or by a nominee of such Depository to such Depository or another
nominee of such Depository or by such Depository or any such nominee to a
successor Depository for such series or a nominee of such successor Depository.

If at any time the Depository for the Securities of a series
notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository
for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depository for the
Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 3.3, the
Company shall appoint a successor Depository with respect to the Securities of
such series. If a successor Depository for the Securities of such series is not
appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice
or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election pursuant to
Section 3.1(b)(23) shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities
of such series and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a
Company Order for the authentication and delivery of certificated Securities of
such series of like tenor, shall authenticate and deliver, Securities of such
series of like tenor in certificated form, in authorized denominations and in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or
Securities of such series of like tenor in global form in exchange for such
Security or Securities in global form.

The Company may at any time in its sole discretion determine that
Securities issued in global form shall no longer be represented by such a
Security or Securities in global form. In such event the Company shall execute,
and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and
delivery of certificated Securities of such series of like tenor, shall
authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series of like tenor in
certificated form, in authorized denominations and in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities of such
series of like tenor in global form in exchange for such Security or Securities
in global form.

35
<PAGE>

If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to
a series of Securities, the Depository for such series may surrender a Security
in global form of such series in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of
such series in certificated form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company
and such Depository. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,

(i) to each Person specified by such Depository a new certificated
Security or Securities of the same series of like tenor, of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount
equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the
Security in global form; and

(ii) to such Depository a new Security in global form of like tenor
in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal
amount of the surrendered Security in global form and the aggregate
principal amount of certificated Securities delivered to Holders thereof.

Upon the exchange of a Security in global form for Securities in
certificated form, such Security in global form shall be cancelled by the
Trustee. Unless expressly provided with respect to the Securities of any series
that such Security may be exchanged for Bearer Securities, Securities in
certificated form issued in exchange for a Security in global form pursuant to
this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized
denominations as the Depository for such Security in global form, pursuant to
instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall
instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons
in whose names such Securities are so registered.

Whenever any Securities are surrendered for exchange, the Company
shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities
which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or upon any
exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the
Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

36
<PAGE>

Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration
of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Registrar
or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Registrar and the Trustee duly
executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
for any exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any registration or transfer or exchange of Securities, other
than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4 or 10.7 not involving any transfer.

If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified
tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (i) to
issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any Securities for a period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection for redemption
of Securities of like tenor and of the series of which such Security is a part
and ending at the close of business on the earliest date on which the relevant
notice of redemption is deemed to have been given to all Holders of Securities
of like tenor and of such series to be redeemed; (ii) to register the transfer
of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption, in whole or
in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part;
or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption, except
that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that
series and like tenor; PROVIDED that such Registered Security shall be
simultaneously surrendered for redemption.

The foregoing provisions relating to registration, transfer and
exchange may be modified, supplemented or superseded with respect to any series
of Securities by a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental
hereto.

Section 3.6. REPLACEMENT SECURITIES. If a mutilated Security or
a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the
Trustee, together with, in proper cases, such security or indemnity as may be
required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a
replacement Registered Security,

37
<PAGE>

if such surrendered Security was a Registered Security, or a replacement Bearer
Security with coupons corresponding to the coupons appertaining to the
surrendered Security, if such surrendered Security was a Bearer Security, of the
same series and date of maturity, if the Trustee's requirements are met.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i)
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security
or Security with a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon and (ii) such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of
either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the
Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,
the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in lieu
of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security
to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant
coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen), a replacement Registered Security, if
such Holder's claim appertains to a Registered Security, or a replacement Bearer
Security with coupons corresponding to the coupons appertaining to the
destroyed, lost or stolen Bearer Security or the Bearer Security to which such
lost, destroyed or stolen coupon appertains, if such Holder's claim appertains
to a Bearer Security, of the same series and principal amount, containing
identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously
outstanding with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to
the destroyed, lost or stolen Security.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or
coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security or coupon, pay such Security
or coupon; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that payment of principal of and any premium
or interest on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section
9.2, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States
and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, any interest on
Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the
coupons appertaining thereto.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the
Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge

38
<PAGE>

that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the
fees and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) connected therewith.

Every new Security of any series with its coupons, if any, issued
pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or
in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon
appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of
the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its
coupon, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon, shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this
Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that
securities and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.

Section 3.7. PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED. (a)
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to any
series of Securities, interest, if any, on any Registered Security which is
payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest at the office or agency maintained for such
purpose pursuant to 9.2; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that at the option of the
Company, interest on any series of Registered Securities that bear interest may
be paid (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as
it shall appear on the Register of Holders of Securities of such series or
(ii) at the expense of the Company, by wire transfer to an account maintained
by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Register of Holders of
Securities of such series.

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with
respect to any series of Securities, (i) interest, if any, on Bearer
Securities shall be paid only against presentation and surrender of the coupons
for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they mature and
(ii) original issue discount, if any, on Bearer Securities shall be paid only
against presentation and

39
<PAGE>

surrender of such Securities; in either case at the office of a Paying Agent
located outside the United States, unless the Company shall have otherwise
instructed the Trustee in writing provided that any such instruction for payment
in the United States does not cause any Bearer Security to be treated as a
"registration-required obligation" under United States laws and regulations.
The interest, if any, on any temporary Bearer Security shall be paid, as to any
installment of interest evidenced by a coupon attached thereto only upon
presentation and surrender of such coupon and, as to other installments of
interest, only upon presentation of such Security for notation thereon of the
payment of such interest. If at the time a payment of principal of or interest,
if any, on a Bearer Security or coupon shall become due, the payment of the full
amount so payable at the office or offices of all the Paying Agents outside the
United States is illegal or effectively precluded because of the imposition of
exchange controls or other similar restrictions on the payment of such amount in
Dollars, then the Company may instruct the Trustee in writing to make such
payments at a Paying Agent located in the United States, provided that provision
for such payment in the United States would not cause such Bearer Security to be
treated as a "registration-required obligation" under United States laws and
regulations.

(b) Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with
respect to any series of Securities, any interest on Registered Securities of
any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on
any interest payment date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Holders on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue
of their having been such Holders, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by
the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2)
below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of such Defaulted
Interest to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or
their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall
deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount
proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make
arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for such deposit prior to the
date of the proposed payment, such

40
<PAGE>

money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause (1) provided.
Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of
such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less
than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than
10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed
payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special
Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall
cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the
Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
each Holder of such Registered Securities at his address as it appears in
the Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.
Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special
Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall
be paid to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business
on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the
following clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of such Defaulted Interest to the
Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a
specified date in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the
requirements of any securities exchange on which such Registered
Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such
exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the
proposed payment pursuant to this clause (2), such manner of payment shall
be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

(c) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section
3.5, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer
of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to
interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other
Security.

Section 3.8. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. Prior to due presentment of
any Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee
and any agent of the

41
<PAGE>

Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered
Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose
of receiving payment of principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section
3.7) interest on such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice
to the contrary.

The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any coupon as the
absolute owner of such Bearer Security or coupon for the purpose of receiving
payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Bearer Security or coupon be overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

None of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the
Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records
relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a
Security in global form, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Security in global form, nothing herein shall
prevent the Company or the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee,
from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization
furnished by any Depository (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such
Security in global form or impair, as between such Depository and owners of
beneficial interests in such Security in global form, the operation of customary
practices governing the exercise of the rights of such Depository (or its
nominee) as Holder of such Security in global form.

Section 3.9. CANCELLATION. The Company at any time may deliver
Securities and coupons to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and any
Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities and coupons surrendered
to them for replacement, for registration of transfer, or for exchange or
payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Securities and coupons surrendered for
replacement, for registration of transfer, or for exchange, payment, redemption
or cancellation and may, but shall not

42
<PAGE>

be required to, dispose of cancelled Securities and coupons and issue a
certificate of destruction to the Company. The Company may not issue new
Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation.

Section 3.10. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, interest on the Securities of each
series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Section 3.11. CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company in issuing the
Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, in such
case, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a
convenience to Holders; PROVIDED that any such notice may state that no
representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed
on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or
omission of such numbers.

Section 3.12. CURRENCY AND MANNER OF PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF
SECURITIES. (a) Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities
pursuant to Section 3.1, with respect to Registered Securities of any series not
permitting the election provided for in paragraph (b) below or the Holders of
which have not made the election provided for in paragraph (b) below, and with
respect to Bearer Securities of any series, except as provided in paragraph (d)
below, payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on
any Registered or Bearer Security of such series will be made in the currency or
currencies or currency unit or units in which such Registered Security or Bearer
Security, as the case may be, is payable. The provisions of this Section 3.12
may be modified or superseded pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to any
Securities.

(b) It may be provided pursuant to Section 3.1, with respect to
Registered Securities of any series, that Holders shall have the option, subject
to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, to receive payments of principal of, premium,
if any, or interest, if any, on such Registered Securities in any of the
currencies or currency units which may be designated for such election by
delivering to the Trustee (or the applicable Paying Agent) a written election
with

43
<PAGE>

signature guarantees and in the applicable form established pursuant to Section
3.1, not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately
preceding the applicable payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such
payments in any such currency or currency unit, such election will remain in
effect for such Holder or any transferee of such Holder until changed by such
Holder or such transferee by written notice to the Trustee (or any applicable
Paying Agent) for such series of Registered Securities (but any such change must
be made not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately
preceding the next payment date to be effective for the payment to be made on
such payment date, and no such change of election may be made with respect to
payments to be made on any Registered Security of such series with respect to
which an Event of Default has occurred or with respect to which the Company has
deposited funds pursuant to Article 4 or with respect to which a notice of
redemption has been given by or on behalf of the Company). Any Holder of any
such Registered Security who shall not have delivered any such election to the
Trustee (or any applicable Paying Agent) not later than the close of business on
the applicable Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable
payment date in the relevant currency or currency unit as provided in Section
3.12(a). The Trustee (or the applicable Paying Agent) shall notify the Exchange
Rate Agent as soon as practicable after the Election Date of the aggregate
principal amount of Registered Securities for which Holders have made such
written election.

(c) If the election referred to in paragraph (b) above has been
provided for with respect to any Registered Securities of a series pursuant to
Section 3.1, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 with
respect to any such Registered Securities, not later than the fourth Business
Day after the Election Date for each payment date for such Registered
Securities, the Exchange Rate Agent will deliver to the Company a written notice
specifying, in the currency or currencies or currency unit or units in which
Registered Securities of such series are payable, the respective aggregate
amounts of principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such
Registered Securities to be paid on such payment date, and specifying the
amounts in such currency or currencies or currency unit or units so payable in
respect of such Registered Securities as to which the Holders of Registered
Securities denominated in any currency or currencies or currency unit or units
shall have elected to be paid in another currency or currency unit as

44
<PAGE>

provided in paragraph (b) above. If the election referred to in paragraph (b)
above has been provided for with respect to any Registered Securities of a
series pursuant to Section 3.1, and if at least one Holder has made such
election, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1, on the
second Business Day preceding such payment date the Company will deliver to the
Trustee (or the applicable Paying Agent) an Exchange Rate Officers' Certificate
in respect of the Dollar, Foreign Currency or Currencies, ECU or other currency
unit payments to be made on such payment date. Unless otherwise specified
pursuant to Section 3.1, the Dollar, Foreign Currency or Currencies, ECU or
other currency unit amount receivable by Holders of Registered Securities who
have elected payment in a currency or currency unit as provided in paragraph (b)
above shall be determined by the Company on the basis of the applicable Market
Exchange Rate in effect on the second Business Day (the "Valuation Date")
immediately preceding each payment date, and such determination shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(d) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign
Currency, ECU or any other currency unit in which any of the Securities are
denominated or payable otherwise than pursuant to an election provided for
pursuant to paragraph (b) above, then, with respect to each date for the payment
of principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the applicable
Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency, ECU or such other
currency unit occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency, ECU
or such other currency unit was used (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall
be the currency of payment for use on each such payment date (but such Foreign
Currency, ECU or such other currency unit that was previously the currency of
payment shall, at the Company's election, resume being the currency of payment
on the first such payment date preceded by 15 Business Days during which the
circumstances which gave rise to the Dollar becoming such currency no longer
prevail). Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1, the Dollar amount
to be paid by the Company to the Trustee or any applicable Paying Agent and by
the Trustee or any applicable Paying Agent to the Holders of such Securities
with respect to such payment date shall be, in the case of a Foreign Currency
other than a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in
the case of a Foreign Currency that is a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of
the Currency Unit,

45
<PAGE>

in each case as determined by the Exchange Rate Agent in the manner provided in
paragraph (f) or (g) below.

(e) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1, if the
Holder of a Registered Security denominated in any currency or currency unit
shall have elected to be paid in another currency or currency unit or in other
currencies as provided in paragraph (b) above, and (i) a Conversion Event
occurs with respect to any such elected currency or currency unit, such Holder
shall receive payment in the currency or currency unit in which payment would
have been made in the absence of such election and (ii) if a Conversion Event
occurs with respect to the currency or currency unit in which payment would have
been made in the absence of such election, such Holder shall receive payment in
Dollars as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section 3.12 (but, subject to any
contravening valid election pursuant to paragraph (b) above, the elected payment
currency or currency unit, in the case of the circumstances described in clause
(i) above, or the payment currency or currency unit in the absence of such
election, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) above,
shall, at the Company's election, resume being the currency or currency unit of
payment with respect to Holders who have so elected, but only with respect to
payments on payment dates preceded by 15 Business Days during which the
circumstances which gave rise to such currency or currency unit, in the case of
the circumstances described in clause (i) above, or the Dollar, in the case of
the circumstances described in clause (ii) above, as applicable, becoming the
currency or currency unit of payment, no longer prevail).

(f) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be
determined by the Exchange Rate Agent and shall be obtained for each subsequent
payment date by the Exchange Rate Agent by converting the specified Foreign
Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Conversion Date.

(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be
determined by the Exchange Rate Agent and, subject to the provisions of
paragraph (h) below, shall be the sum of each amount obtained by converting the
Specified Amount of each Component Currency (as each such term is defined in
paragraph (h) below) into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such Component
Currency on the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.

46
<PAGE>

(h) For purposes of this Section 3.12 the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

A "Component Currency" shall mean any currency which, on the
Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency unit,
including, but not limited to, ECU.

"Election Date" shall mean the Regular Record Date for the
applicable series of Registered Securities as specified pursuant to Section 3.1
by which the written election referred to in Section 3.12(b) may be made.

A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number
of units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof which such Component
Currency represented in the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited
to, ECU, on the Conversion Date. If after the Conversion Date the official unit
of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the
Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in
the same proportion. If after the Conversion Date two or more Component
Currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the respective Specified
Amounts of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such
consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single currency, and such
amount shall thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single currency shall
thereafter be a Component Currency. If after the Conversion Date any Component
Currency shall be divided into two or more currencies, the Specified Amount of
such Component Currency shall be replaced by specified amounts of such two or
more currencies, the sum of which, at the Market Exchange Rate of such two or
more currencies on the date of such replacement, shall be equal to the Specified
Amount of such former Component Currency and such amounts shall thereafter be
Specified Amounts and such currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies.
If, after the Conversion Date of the relevant currency unit, including, but not
limited to, ECU, a Conversion Event (other than any event referred to above in
this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with respect to any Component
Currency of such currency unit and is continuing on the applicable Valuation
Date, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall, for purposes of
calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, be converted into
Dollars at the Market

47
<PAGE>

Exchange Rate in effect on the Conversion Date of such Component Currency.

All decisions and determinations of the Exchange Rate Agent
regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent
of the Currency Unit, the Market Exchange Rate and changes in the Specified
Amounts as specified above shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably
binding upon the Company, the Trustee (and any applicable Paying Agent) and all
Holders of Securities denominated or payable in the relevant currency,
currencies or currency units. The Exchange Rate Agent shall promptly give
written notice to the Company and the Trustee of any such decision or
determination.

In the event that the Company determines in good faith that a
Conversion Event has occurred with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Company
will promptly give written notice thereof to the Trustee (or any applicable
Paying Agent) and to the Exchange Rate Agent (and the Trustee (or such Paying
Agent) will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section
1.6 to the affected Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event the
Company so determines that a Conversion Event has occurred with respect to ECU
or any other currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the
Company will promptly give written notice thereof to the Trustee (or any
applicable Paying Agent) and to the Exchange Rate Agent (and the Trustee (or
such Paying Agent)) will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided
in Section 1.6 to the affected Holders) specifying the Conversion Date and the
Specified Amount of each Component Currency on the Conversion Date. In the
event the Company determines in good faith that any subsequent change in any
Component Currency as set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above has
occurred, the Company will similarly give written notice to the Trustee (or any
applicable Paying Agent) and to the Exchange Rate Agent.

The Trustee of the appropriate series of Securities shall be fully
justified and protected in relying and acting upon information received by it
from the Company and the Exchange Rate Agent and shall not otherwise have any
duty or obligation to determine the accuracy or validity of such information
independent of the Company or the Exchange Rate Agent.

Section 3.13. APPOINTMENT AND RESIGNATION OF EXCHANGE RATE AGENT.
(a) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1, if and so long as the
Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a currency other than Dollars
or (ii) may be payable in a currency other than Dollars, or so long as it is
required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Company will
maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required, at
least one Exchange Rate Agent. The Company will cause the Exchange Rate Agent
to make the necessary foreign exchange determinations at the time and in the
manner specified pursuant to Section 3.12 for the purpose of determining the
applicable rate of exchange and, if applicable, for the purpose of converting
the issued currency or currencies or currency unit or units into the applicable
payment currency or currency unit for the payment of principal, premium, if any,
and interest, if any, pursuant to Section 3.12.

(b) No resignation of the Exchange Rate Agent and no appointment of
a successor Exchange Rate Agent pursuant to this Section shall become effective
until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Exchange Rate Agent as
evidenced by a written instrument delivered to the Company and the Trustee of
the appropriate series of Securities accepting such appointment executed by the
successor Exchange Rate Agent.

(c) If the Exchange Rate Agent shall resign, be removed or become
incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Exchange
Rate Agency for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series,
the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a
successor Exchange Rate Agent or Exchange Rate Agents with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor
Exchange Rate Agent may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or
more or all of such series and that, unless otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 3.1, at any time there shall only be one Exchange Rate Agent with
respect to the Securities of any particular series that are originally issued by
the Company on the same date and that are initially denominated and/or payable
in the same currency or currencies or currency unit or units).

and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in

the case may be;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable hereunder by the Company; and

(3) the Company delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent
herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture as to such series have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligation
of the Company to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.9, the
obligations of the Company to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and,
if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of
clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.2 and
the last paragraph of Section 9.3 shall survive.

Section 4.2. APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS. Subject to the
provisions of the last paragraph of Section 9.3, all money deposited with the
Trustee pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in
accordance with the provisions of the Securities, the coupons and this

51
<PAGE>

Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the
Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal,
premium, if any and any interest for whose payment such money has been deposited
with or received by the Trustee, but such money need not be segregated from
other funds except to the extent required by law.

Section 4.3. APPLICABILITY OF DEFEASANCE PROVISIONS; COMPANY'S
OPTION TO EFFECT DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE. If pursuant to Section 3.1
provision is made for either or both of (i) defeasance of the Securities of or
within a series under Section 4.4 or (ii) covenant defeasance of the
Securities of or within a series under Section 4.5, then the provisions of such
Section or Sections, as the case may be, together with the provisions of
Sections 4.6 through 4.9 inclusive, with such modifications thereto as may be
specified pursuant to Section 3.1 with respect to any Securities, shall be
applicable to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, and the
Company may at its option by or pursuant to Board Resolution, at any time, with
respect to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, elect to have
Section 4.4 (if applicable) or Section 4.5 (if applicable) be applied to such
Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with
the conditions set forth below in this Article.

Section 4.4. DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE. Upon the Company's
exercise of the option specified in Section 4.3 applicable to this Section with
respect to the Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be deemed to
have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities and
any coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth
in Section 4.6 are satisfied (hereinafter "defeasance"). For this purpose, such
defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged
the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only
for the purposes of Section 4.7 and the other Sections of this Indenture
referred to in clause (ii) of this Section, and to have satisfied all its other
obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this
Indenture insofar as such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto are
concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall on a Company
Order execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except the

52
<PAGE>

following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged
hereunder: (i) the rights of Holders of such Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust funds described in
Section 4.6(a) and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect
of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Securities
or any coupons appertaining thereto when such payments are due; (ii) the
Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.5, 3.6,
9.2 and 9.3 and with respect to the payment of additional amounts, if any,
payable with respect to such Securities as specified pursuant to Section
3.1(b)(16); (iii) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the
Trustee hereunder and (iv) this Article 4. Subject to compliance with this
Article 4, the Company may exercise its option under this Section
notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 4.5 with respect
to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto. Following a
defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default.

Section 4.5. COVENANT DEFEASANCE. Upon the Company's exercise of
the option specified in Section 4.3 applicable to this Section with respect to
any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be released from its
obligations under Sections 7.1, 9.4 and 9.7 and, if specified pursuant to
Section 3.1, its obligations under any other covenant, with respect to such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the
conditions set forth in Section 4.6 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant
defeasance"), and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall
thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction,
waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any
thereof) in connection with Sections 7.1, 9.4 and 9.7 or such other covenant,
but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder.
For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply
with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation
set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or
indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or
such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other
covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such
omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under
Sec-

53
<PAGE>

tion 5.1(3) or 5.1(7) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified
above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby.

Section 4.6. CONDITIONS TO DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE.
The following shall be the conditions to application of Section 4.4 or Section
4.5 to any Securities of or within a series and any coupons appertaining
thereto:

entitled to the benefits of, the provisions of Sections 4.3 through 4.9
inclusive and the last paragraph of Section 9.3 applicable to the Trustee,
for purposes of such Sections also a "Trustee") as trust funds in trust
for the purpose of making the payments referred to in clauses (x) and (y)
of this Section 4.6(a), specifically pledged as security for, and
dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any

amount or (C) a combination thereof in an amount, sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the
Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee

satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date or
dates in accordance with Article 10 which shall be given effect in applying the
foregoing.

(b) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a Default or Event of Default under,
this Indenture or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any other material agreement or instrument to which the
Company is a party or by which it is bound.

(c) In the case of an election under Section 4.4, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that (i) the Company has received from, or there
has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii)
since the date of execution of this Indenture, there has been a change in
the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that,
and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income,
gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such
defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount
and in the same manner and at the same times, as would have been the case
if such deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred.

(d) In the case of an election under Section 4.5, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the
Holders of such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto will not
recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result
of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on
the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.

(e) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent to the defeasance under Section 4.4 or the covenant defeasance
under Section 4.5 (as the case may be) have been complied with.

55
<PAGE>

(f) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's
Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities nor any other
Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange,
will be delisted as a result of such deposit.

(g) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both
would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any
other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 5.1(5) and
(6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such
deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed
satisfied until after such 90th day).

(h) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the
trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 unless such trust shall
be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder.

(i) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in
compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or
limitations which may be imposed on the Company in connection therewith as
contemplated by Section 3.1.

Section 4.7. DEPOSITED MONEY AND GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS TO BE HELD
IN TRUST. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 9.3, all
money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant
to Section 3.1) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee
pursuant to Section 4.6 in respect of any Securities of any series and any
coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee,
in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or
through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent)
as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of
principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, but such money need not be
segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

56
<PAGE>

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Security pursuant to
Section 3.1, if, after a deposit referred to in Section 4.6(a) has been made,
(i) the Holder of a Security in respect of which such deposit was made is
entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 3.12(b) or the terms of such
Security to receive payment in a currency or currency unit other than that in
which the deposit pursuant to Section 4.6(a) has been made in respect of such
Security, or (ii) a Conversion Event occurs as contemplated in Section 3.12(d)
or 3.12(e) or by the terms of any Security in respect of which the deposit
pursuant to Section 4.6(a) has been made, the indebtedness represented by such
Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be deemed to have been, and
will be, fully discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Security as the same becomes due
out of the proceeds yielded by converting (from time to time as specified below
in the case of any such election) the amount or other property deposited in
respect of such Security into the currency or currency unit in which such
Security becomes payable as a result of such election or Conversion Event based
on the applicable Market Exchange Rate for such currency or currency unit in
effect on the second Business Day prior to each payment date, except, with
respect to a Conversion Event, for such currency or currency unit in effect (as
nearly as feasible) at the time of the Conversion Event.

Section 4.8. REPAYMENT TO COMPANY. The Trustee (and any Paying
Agent) shall promptly pay to the Company upon Company Request any excess money
or securities held by them at any time.

Section 4.9. INDEMNITY FOR GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS. The Company
shall pay, and shall indemnify the Trustee against, any tax, fee or other charge
imposed on or assessed against Government Obligations deposited pursuant to this
Article or the principal and interest and any other amount received on such
Government Obligations.

Section 4.10. REINSTATEMENT. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent
is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any
Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental
authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then
the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company
has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 4.4 or 4.5 shall

57
<PAGE>

be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this
Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the trustee or
Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section
4.7 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium
or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its
obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the
Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in
trust.

ARTICLE 5

DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

Section 5.1. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. An "Event of Default" occurs
with respect to the Securities of any series if (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected
by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

(1) the Company defaults in the payment of interest on any
Security of that series or any coupon appertaining thereto or any
additional amount payable with respect to any Security of that series as
specified pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(16) when the same becomes due and
payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of or any
premium on any Security of that series when the same becomes due and
payable at its Maturity or on redemption or otherwise, or in the payment
of a mandatory sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of the
Securities of that series;

(3) the Company fails to comply in any material respect with any of
its agreements or covenants in, or any of the provisions of, this
Indenture with respect to any Security of that series (other than an
agreement, covenant or provision for which non-compliance is elsewhere in

for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or

58
<PAGE>

certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the
Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of the series, a written notice specifying such
default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such
notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder;

(4) a default under any mortgage, agreement, indenture or
instrument under which there may be issued, or by which there may be
secured, guaranteed or evidenced any Debt of the Company (including this
Indenture) whether such Debt now exists or shall hereafter be created, in
an aggregate principal amount then outstanding of $25,000,000 or more,
which default (a) shall constitute a failure to pay any portion of the
principal of such Debt when due and payable after the expiration of any
applicable grace period with respect thereto or (b) shall result in such
Debt becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which
it would otherwise become due and payable, and such acceleration shall not
be rescinded or annulled, or such Debt shall not be paid in full within a
period of 30 days after there has been given, by registered or certified
mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by
the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such
event of default and requiring the Company to cause such acceleration to
be rescinded or annulled or to pay in full such Debt and stating that such
notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; (it being understood however,

under such agreement or instrument unless either (A) a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of such default or
(B) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received written
notice thereof from the Company, from any Holder, from the holder of any
such indebtedness or from the trustee under any such agreement or other
instrument); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such default under such
agreement or instrument is remedied or cured by the Company or waived by
the holders of such indebtedness, then the Event of Default hereunder by
reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied,
cured or waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee
or any of such Holders; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the foregoing shall
not apply

59
<PAGE>

to any secured Debt under which the obligee has recourse (exclusive of
recourse for ancillary matters such as environmental indemnities,
misapplication of funds, costs of enforcement and the like) only to the
collateral pledged for repayment so long as the fair market value of such
collateral does not exceed 2% of Total Assets at the time of the default;

or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law, (A) commences a voluntary

its property, or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or Protective
Life Insurance Company, and the order or decree remains unstayed and in

3.1 with respect to Securities of that series.

U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency,

Section 5.2. ACCELERATION; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT. If an Event
of Default with respect to the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of all of the Outstanding Securities of that series,
by written notice to the Company (and, if given by the Holders, to the Trustee),
may declare the principal (or, if the Securities of that series are Original
Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal
amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of and accrued interest,
if any, on all the Securities of that series to be due and payable and upon any
such declaration such principal (or, in the case of Original Issue Discount
Securities or Indexed Securities, such specified amount) and interest, if any,
shall be immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Securities of any series has been made and before a judgement or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Trustee, may
rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
all existing Defaults and Events of Default with respect to Securities of that
series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series
which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been
cured or waived as provided in Section 5.7. No such rescission shall affect any
subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 5.3. COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR
ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE. The Company covenants that if

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security
or coupon, if any, when such interest becomes due and payable and such
default continues for a period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium,
if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities or coupons, if any, the whole amount then due and
payable on such

61
<PAGE>

Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest and, to the extent that
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue
principal, premium, if any, and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Securities or coupons, if any, and, in addition
thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect
and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such
series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to secure any other proper remedy.

Section 5.4. TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. The Trustee may
file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and take such actions
authorized under the Trust Indenture Act as may be necessary or advisable in
order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders of Securities allowed in
any judicial proceedings relating to the Company, its creditors or its property.
In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys
or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute
the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,
sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby
authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the trustee and, in the event
that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.9.

Section 5.5. TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF
SECURITIES. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the
Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee, in its own name as an
express trust, without the possession of any of the Securities or the production
thereof in any proceeding relating thereto and any recovery of judgment shall,
after provision for the

62
<PAGE>

reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee and its counsel, be for the ratable
benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which judgment was
recovered.

Section 5.6. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. No delay or omission
by the Trustee or any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy
accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in any such Event of Default.

Section 5.7. WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. The Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any series by written
notice to the Trustee may waive on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of
such series a past Default or Event of Default with respect to that series and
its consequences except (i) a Default or Event of Default in the payment of
the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series or
any coupon appertaining thereto or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision
hereof which pursuant to Section 8.2 cannot be amended or modified without the
consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose
of this Indenture.

Section 5.8. CONTROL BY MAJORITY. The Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected
(with each such series voting as a class) shall have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it with respect to
Securities of that series; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Trustee may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, (ii)
the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of the Holders of Securities of such series not consenting, or that would
in the good faith judgment of the Trustee have a substantial likelihood of
involving the Trustee in personal liability and (iii) the Trustee may take any
other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such

the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order,
bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or

to the Holders of Securities of such series, in the manner and to the extent
provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, notice of all Defaults
known to it unless such Default shall have been cured or waived; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that except in the case of a Default in payment on the Securities of
any series, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as the board of
directors, the executive committee or a committee of its Responsible Officers in
good faith determines that withholding such notice is in the interests of
Holders of Securities of that series; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that in the
case of any Default of the character specified in Section 5.1(3) with respect to
Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at
least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.

mail to all Holders of Securities as provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust
Indenture Act a brief report dated as of such May 15 if required by and in
compliance with Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act. A copy of each such
report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the
Trustee with each stock exchange, if any, upon which the Securities are listed,

the possession or control of the Registrar, the Company or any of its Paying
Agents other than the Trustee as to the names and addresses of Holders of
Securities of each such series. If there are Bearer Securities of any series
Outstanding, even if the Trustee is the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to
the Trustee such a list containing such information with respect to Holders of
such Bearer Securities only.

Section 6.9. COMPENSATION AND INDEMNITY. (a) The Company shall
pay to the Trustee from time to time such reasonable compensation for its
services as the Company and the Trustee shall agree in writing from time to
time. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on
compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the
Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in

predecessor Trustee, and hold it harmless against, any loss or liability,
damage, claim or reasonable expense including taxes (other than taxes based upon

trusts hereunder, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending
itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or
performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify
the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company
shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The

and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made
without its consent.

any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through negligence or bad faith.

this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities of any
series on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that
held in trust to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on particular
Securities.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection
with an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(5) or Section 5.1(6), the
expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the
compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of
administration under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law.

The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this
Indenture.

removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee shall become

Trustee for such series with the Company's consent.

(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 310(b) of the Trust
Indenture Act after written request therefor by the Company or by any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six
months, or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.12 of
this Agreement or Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act and shall fail
to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any

71
<PAGE>

Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at
least six months; or

(3) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting, is adjudged a bankrupt
or an insolvent or a receiver or public officer takes charge of the
Trustee or its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by or pursuant to a Board Resolution
may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to
Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act, any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a
successor Trustee or Trustees.

(e) If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required
by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days
after the giving of such notice of resignation or removal, the Trustee resigning
or being removed may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series.

(f) If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in
the office of Trustee for any reason, with respect to Securities of one or more
series, the Company, by or pursuant to Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint
a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it
being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect
to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time
there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular
series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If,
within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the
occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities
of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the
Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall,
forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 6.11, become the successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the
successor

72
<PAGE>

Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the
Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 6.11, any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least
six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition
any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of such series.

Section 6.11. ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR. (a) In
case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all
Securities, every such successor Trustee shall execute, acknowledge and deliver
to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee
shall become effective, and the successor Trustee, without further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee,
such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an
instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and
trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to
such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee
hereunder.

(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company,
the retiring Trustee and such successor Trustee shall execute and deliver an
indenture supplemental hereto wherein such successor Trustee shall accept such
appointment and which (i) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or
desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, such successor Trustee all
the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to
the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such
successor Trustee relates, (ii) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with
respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed
necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties
of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series
as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in
the retiring Trustee, and (iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of
this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for

73
<PAGE>

or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one
Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental
indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that
each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and
apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee
and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the
extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or
those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on
request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall
duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of
that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the
time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible
under the Trust Indenture Act.

(e) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each
removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series
in the manner provided for notices to the Holders of Securities in Section 1.6.
Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust office.

Section 6.12. ELIGIBILITY; DISQUALIFICATION. There shall at all
times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be eligible to act as Trustee under
Section 310(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act and shall have a combined capital
and

74
<PAGE>

surplus of at least $75,000,000. If such corporation publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or the requirements of Federal,
State, Territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority,
then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it
shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified
in this Article.

Section 6.13. MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO
BUSINESS. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

Section 6.14. APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT. The Trustee
may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series
of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to
authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue, exchange,
registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so
authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be
valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee
hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing
signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, a copy of which instrument shall
be promptly furnished to the Company. Wherever reference is made in this
Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the
Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be

75
<PAGE>

deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and, except as may otherwise be provided pursuant to
Section 3.1, shall at all times be a bank or trust company or corporation
organized and doing business and in good standing under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State or the District of Columbia, authorized under
such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus
of not less than $25,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by
Federal or State authorities. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or the requirements of the
aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this
Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. In case at any time an Authenticating Agent
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section,
such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in this Section.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an
Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or further act
on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may at any time
resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series
and to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time
terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of
termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving
such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time
such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor
Authenticating Agent

76
<PAGE>

which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such
appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which
such Authenticating Agent will serve in the manner set forth in Section 1.6.
Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent
herein. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible
under the provisions of this Section.

The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to
time reasonable compensation including reimbursement of its reasonable expenses
for its services under this Section.

If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made
pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed
thereon, in addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of
authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the
following form:

This is one of the Securities of the series described in the
within-mentioned Indenture.

merger (if other than the Company),

<PAGE>

or to which such transfer or lease shall have been made, is a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any State

encumbrance which would not be permitted by the Securities of any series,
the Company or such successor Person, as the case may be, shall take such
steps as shall be necessary effectively to secure such Securities equally
and ratably with all indebtedness secured thereby.

The Company shall deliver to the Trustee prior to the proposed
transaction an Officers' Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that the proposed transaction and such supplemental indenture
comply with this Indenture and that all conditions precedent to the consummation
of the transaction under this Indenture have been met.

provided in clause (2) above, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be
substituted for the Company hereunder and under the Securities with the same
effect as if it had been named hereunder and thereunder and any coupons
appertaining thereto and all such obligations of the Company shall terminate.

Section 8.2. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITH CONSENT OF HOLDERS.
With the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal

consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby, a
supplemental indenture under this Section may not:

the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies
the rights of the Holders of Securities of such

81
<PAGE>

series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to
affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other
series.

It is not necessary under this Section 8.2 for the Holders to
consent to the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it is
sufficient if they consent to the substance thereof.

Section 8.3. COMPLIANCE WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. Every
amendment to this Indenture or the Securities of one or more series shall be set
forth in a supplemental indenture that complies with the Trust Indenture Act as
then in effect.

Section 8.4. EXECUTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. In executing,
or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture
permitted by this Article or the modification thereby of the trusts created by
this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully
protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of
such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The
Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental
indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under
this Indenture or otherwise.

Section 8.5. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. Upon the
execution of any supplemental indenture under this article, this Indenture shall

Company shall so determine, new Securities including any coupons of any series
so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any
such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and

82
<PAGE>

authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding
Securities including any coupons of such series.

ARTICLE 9

COVENANTS

Section 9.1. PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM, IF ANY, AND INTEREST.
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of each series
of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest together with additional amounts, if any, on the Securities of
that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series, any
coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture. An installment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest shall be considered paid on the date it is due if
the Trustee or Paying Agent holds on that date money designated for and
sufficient to pay the installment.

Section 9.2. MAINTENANCE OF OFFICE OR AGENCY. If Securities of a
series are issued as Registered Securities, the Company will maintain in each
Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where
Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where
Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the
Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. If Securities of a
series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the Company will maintain, (i)
subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, an office or agency in a
Place of Payment for that series which is located outside the United States
where Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented and
surrendered for payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Securities of that
series are listed on The International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and
the Republic of Ireland Limited, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other
stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall
so require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Securities of that
series in London, Luxembourg or any other required city located outside the
United States, as the case may be, so long as the Securities of that series are
listed on such exchange, and (ii) subject to any laws or regulations
applicable

83
<PAGE>

thereto, an office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series which is
located outside the United States, where Securities of that series may be
surrendered for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in
respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The
Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any
change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the
Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail
to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, no
payment of principal, premium or interest on Bearer Securities shall be made at
any office or agency of the Company in the United States, by check mailed to any
address in the United States, by transfer to an account located in the United
States or upon presentation or surrender in the United States of a Bearer
Security or coupon for payment, even if the payment would be credited to an
account located outside the United States; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the
Securities of a series are denominated and payable in Dollars, payment of
principal of and any premium or interest on any such Bearer Security shall be
made at the office of the Company's Paying Agent located withing the United
States, if (but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such
principal, premium or interest, as the case may be, at all offices or agencies
outside the United States maintained for the purpose by the Company in
accordance with this Indenture is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange
controls or other similar restrictions.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other
offices or agencies where the Securities (including any coupons, if any) of one
or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and
may from time to time rescind such designations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its
obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for
Securities (including any coupons, if any) of any series for such purposes. The
Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation
or

84
<PAGE>

rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, the
Trustee shall initially serve as Paying Agent.

Section 9.3. MONEY FOR SECURITIES PAYMENTS TO BE HELD IN TRUST;
UNCLAIMED MONEY. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent
with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of
the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of that
series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest so
becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of its
action or failure so to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of
Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an
instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to
the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on Securities of that series in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to
such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any
other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any
payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities; and

(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon
the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums
so held in trust by such Paying Agent.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in

85
<PAGE>

trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same terms as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee,
such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to
such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then
held by the Company, in trust for the payment of any principal, premium or
interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such principal, premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable
shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the
Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security
and coupon, if any, shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look
only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or
such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the
Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a
newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each
Business Day and of general circulation in The City of New York, or cause to be
mailed to such Holder, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after
a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of
such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be
repaid to the Company.

Section 9.4. CORPORATE EXISTENCE. Subject to Article 7, the
Company will at all times do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and its
rights and franchises; PROVIDED that nothing in this Section 9.4 shall prevent
the abandonment or termination of any right or franchise of the Company if, in
the opinion of the Company, such abandonment or termination is in the best
interests of the Company and not prejudicial in any material respect to the
Holders of the Securities.

Section 9.5. REPORTS BY THE COMPANY. The Company covenants:

(a) to file with the Trustee, within 30 days after the Company is
required to file the same with

86
<PAGE>

the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information,
documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the
foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations
prescribe) which the Company may be required to file with the Commission
pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended; or, if the Company is not required to file information,
documents or reports pursuant to either of such sections, then to file
with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and
regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the
supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be
required pursuant to section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, in respect of a security listed and registered on a national
securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules
and regulations;

(b) to file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with
the rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission,
such additional information, documents and reports with respect to
compliance by the Company with the conditions and covenants provided for
in this Indenture, as may be required from time to time by such rules and
regulations; and

(c) to transmit to all Holders of Securities, within 30 days after
the filing thereof with the Trustee, in the manner and to the extent
provided in section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, such summaries of
any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Company
pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9.5, as may be
required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the
Commission.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee
is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including information
concerning the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder,
PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not relieve the Trustee of any of its
responsibilities hereunder.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT. (a) The Company covenants and agrees to deliver to the

ARTICLE 10

REDEMPTION

Section 10.1. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. Securities (including
coupons, if any) of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity
shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of any series) in
accordance with this Article.

Section 10.2. ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE. The
election of the Company to redeem any Securities, including coupons, if any,
shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In the case of any
redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities or
coupons, if any, of any series, the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the
Redemption

88
<PAGE>

Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the
Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of
Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the
Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities (i)
prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the
terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture or (ii) pursuant to an
election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms
of such Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers'
Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.

Section 10.3. SELECTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REDEEMED. Unless
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, if less than all the
Securities (including coupons, if any) of a series with the same terms are to be
redeemed, the Trustee, not more than 45 days prior to the redemption date, shall
select the Securities of the series to be redeemed in such manner as the Trustee
shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for
redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series,
PROVIDED that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security
shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum
authorized denomination) for such Security. The Trustee shall make the
selection from Securities of the series that are Outstanding and that have not
previously been called for redemption and may provide for the selection for
redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for
Securities, including coupons, if any, of that series or any integral multiple
thereof) of the principal amount of Securities, including coupons, if any, of
such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination
for Securities of that series. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of the Securities selected by the Trustee for redemption and, in the
case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct, Securities registered
in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any Subsidiary thereof shall not be
included in the Securities selected for redemption. If less than all the
Securities of any series with differing issue dates, interest rates and stated
maturities are to be redeemed, the Company in its sole discretion shall select
the particular Securities to be redeemed and shall

89
<PAGE>

notify the Trustee in writing thereof at least 45 days prior to the relevant
redemption date.

For purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities (including
coupons, if any) shall relate, in the case of any Securities (including coupons,
if any) redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal
amount of such Securities (including coupons, if any) which has been or is to be
redeemed.

Section 10.4. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Unless otherwise specified
as contemplated by Section 3.1, notice of redemption shall be given in the
manner provided in Section 1.6 not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior
to the Redemption Date to the Holders of the Securities to be redeemed.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price;

(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of a series are to
be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption,
the principal amounts) of the particular Security or Securities to be
redeemed;

(4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the
Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the holder will receive,
without a charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations
for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed;

(5) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities, together
in the case of Bearer Securities with all coupons appertaining thereto, if
any, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment
for the Redemption Price;

(6) that Securities of the series called for redemption and all
unmatured coupons, if any, apper-

90
<PAGE>

taining thereto must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the
Redemption Price;

(7) that, on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price will become
due and payable upon each such Security, or the portion thereof, to be
redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on
and after said date;

(8) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the
case;

(9) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Bearer
Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be
accompanied by all coupons maturing subsequent to the Redemption Date or
the amount of any such missing coupon or coupons will be deducted from the
Redemption Price, unless security or indemnity satisfactory to the
Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent is furnished; and

(10) the CUSIP number, if any, of the Securities.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed shall be given by
the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the
expense of the Company.

Section 10.5. DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE. On or prior to any
Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying
Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, which it may not do
in the case of a sinking fund payment under Article 11, segregate and hold in
trust as provided in Section 9.3) an amount of money in the currency or
currencies (including currency unit or units) in which the Securities of such
series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.1 for
the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay on the Redemption Date the
Redemption Price of, and (unless the Redemption Date shall be an Interest
Payment Date) interest accrued to the Redemption Date on, all Securities or
portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.

Unless any Security by its terms prohibits any sinking fund payment
obligation from being satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities
(including Securities

91
<PAGE>

redeemed otherwise than through a sinking fund), the Company may deliver such
Securities to the Trustee for crediting against such payment obligation in
accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.

Section 10.6. SECURITIES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE. Notice of
redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed
shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price
therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such
Securities shall cease to bear interest and the coupons for any such interest
appertaining to any Bearer Security so to be redeemed, except to the extent
provided below, shall be void. Except as provided in the next succeeding
paragraph, upon surrender of any such Security, including coupons, if any, for
redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the
Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the
Redemption Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that installments of interest on Bearer
Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be
payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and it
possessions (except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2) and, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, only upon presentation and surrender
of coupons for such interest; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, installments of interest on Registered
Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be
payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor
Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record
Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7.

If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be
accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such
Bearer Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount
equal to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such
missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there
be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each
of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer
Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing
coupon in respect of which a deduction shall

92
<PAGE>

have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to
receive the amount so deducted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that interest represented
by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside of the
United States (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 9.2) and, unless
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, only upon presentation and
surrender of those coupons.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall,
until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed
therefor in the Security.

Section 10.7. SECURITIES REDEEMED IN PART. Upon surrender of a
Security that is redeemed in part at any Place of Payment therefor (with, if the
Company or the Trustee so required, due endorsement by, or a written instrument
of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed
by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of
that Security, without service charge a new Security or Securities of the same
series, having the same form, terms and Stated Maturity, in any authorized
denomination equal in aggregate principal amount to the unredeemed portion of
the principal amount of the Security surrendered.

ARTICLE 11

SINKING FUNDS

Section 11.1. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. The provisions of this
Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities
of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for
Securities of such series.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the
terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking
fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by
the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional
sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any
series, the

93
<PAGE>

cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided
in Section 11.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption
of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such
series.

Section 11.2. SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH
SECURITIES. The Company (i) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series
(other than any previously called for redemption) together, in the case of
Bearer Securities of such series, with all unmatured coupons appertaining
thereto and (ii) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been
redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such
Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund
payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction
of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of
such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as
provided for by the terms of such series; PROVIDED that such Securities have
not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited
for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such
Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount
of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 11.3. REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES FOR SINKING FUND. Not
less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of
Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series
pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to
be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be
satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to
Section 11.2 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so
delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the
Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund
payment date in the manner specified in Section 10.3 and cause notice of the
redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company
in the manner provided in Section 10.4. Such notice having been duly given, the
redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner
stated in Sections 10.6 and 10.7.

Section 2.7 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS. For the benefit of the Holders
from time to time of the Senior Notes, and in addition to the covenants set
forth in Article 9 of the Indenture, the Company further covenants and agrees as
follows:

a. LIMITATIONS ON DISPOSITION OF CAPITAL STOCK OF RESTRICTED
SUBSIDIARIES. The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of
the capital stock of any Restricted Subsidiary unless the entire capital
stock of such Restricted Subsidiary at the time owned by the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be disposed of at the same time for a
consideration consisting of cash or other property which the Board of
Directors has determined to be at least equal to the fair value thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, (i) the Company shall be permitted
to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise

3
<PAGE>

dispose of shares of the capital stock of a Restricted Subsidiary (a) to
any director (or any individual nominated to become a director) of such
Restricted Subsidiary but only to the extent ownership of such shares is
required as directors' qualifying shares for such director or individual
and (b) to any Subsidiary; and (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary shall be
permitted to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of its
capital stock or the capital stock of any other Restricted Subsidiary
(a) to any director (or any individual nominated to become a director) of
such Restricted Subsidiary but only to the extent ownership of such shares
is required as directors' qualifying shares for such director or
individual, or (b) to the Company or any Subsidiary.

b. LIMITATIONS UPON CREATION OF LIENS ON CAPITAL STOCK OF RESTRICTED
SUBSIDIARIES. The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, at any time directly or indirectly, issue, assume, guarantee
or permit to exist any indebtedness secured by a Lien on the capital stock
of any Restricted Subsidiary without making effective provision whereby the
Senior Notes then outstanding (and if the Company so elects, any other
indebtedness ranking on a parity with the Senior Notes) shall be equally
and ratably secured with such indebtedness as to such property so long as
such other indebtedness shall be so secured; provided, however, that the
covenant set forth in this Section 2.7(b) will not be applicable to Liens
(i) on the shares of stock of a subsidiary of a Person that is merged with
or into the Company or a Subsidiary securing debt of such Person, which
debt was outstanding prior to such merger, but only if such pledge and debt
were not incurred in anticipation of such merger, (ii) in favor of the
Company securing debt of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to the Company,
(iii) for taxes or assessments or governmental charges or levies not then
due and delinquent or the validity of which are being contested in good
faith or which are less than $5,000,000, or (iv) created by or resulting
from any litigation or legal proceeding being contested in good faith or
involving claims of less than $5,000,000.

If the Company shall hereafter be required to secure the Senior Notes
equally and ratably with any other indebtedness pursuant to this Section
2.7(b),

4
<PAGE>

(i) the Company will promptly deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate stating that the foregoing covenant has been complied with and
an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel the
foregoing covenant has been complied with and that any instruments executed
by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the performance of the
foregoing covenant comply with the requirements of the foregoing covenant
and (ii) the Trustee is hereby authorized to enter into an indenture or
agreement supplemental hereto and to take such action, if any, as it may
deem advisable to enable it to enforce the rights of the Holders of the
Senior Notes.

For purposes of this Section 2.7, "Restricted Subsidiary" shall mean
any Subsidiary of the Company with assets greater than or equal to 20% of all
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, computed and consolidated in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

For purposes of this Section 2.7, "Lien" shall mean any mortgage,
pledge, lien, charge, security interest, conditional sale or other title
retention agreement or other encumbrance of any nature whatsoever.

Section 2.8 MODIFICATION OF EVENTS OF DEFAULT. For the benefit of
the Holders from time to time of the Senior Notes, clause 4 of Section 5.1 of
the Indenture is hereby modified by deleting such clause 4 in its entirety and
replacing it with the following:

"(4) a default under any mortgage, agreement, indenture or instrument
under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured,
guaranteed or evidenced any Debt of the Company (including this Indenture)
whether such Debt now exists or shall hereafter be created, in an aggregate
principal amount then outstanding of $15,000,000 or more, which default (a)
shall constitute a failure to pay any portion of the principal of such Debt
when due and payable or (b) shall result in such Debt becoming or being
declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise
become due and payable, and such acceleration shall not be rescinded or
annulled, or such Debt shall not be paid in full, within a period of 30
days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the
Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of
at least 25% in aggregate

5
<PAGE>

principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written
notice specifying such event of default and requiring the Company to cause
such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled or to pay in full such Debt
and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; (it being
understood however, that the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge
of such default under such agreement or instrument unless either (A) a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of such
default or (B) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received
written notice thereof from the Company, from any Holder, from the holder
of any such indebtedness or from the trustee under any such agreement or
other instrument); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such default under such
mortgage, agreement, indenture or instrument is remedied or cured by the
Company or waived by the holders of such indebtedness, then the Event of
Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been
thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of
either the Trustee or any of such Holders; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the
foregoing shall not apply to any secured Debt under which the obligee has
recourse (exclusive of recourse for ancillary matters such as environmental
indemnities, misapplication of funds, costs of enforcement and the like)
only to the collateral pledged for repayment so long as the fair market
value of such collateral does not exceed 2% of Total Assets at the time of
the default;"

This Senior Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of
the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or
more series under a Senior Indenture, dated as of June 1, 1994 (herein, together
with all indentures supplemental thereto, including Supplemental Indenture No.
1, dated as of July 1, 1994, called the "Indenture"), from the Company to The
Bank of New York, (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture reference is hereby
made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the
Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be,
authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on
the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $75,000,000, and is
issued pursuant to Supplemental Indenture No. 1, dated as of July 1, 1994, from
the Company to the Trustee, relating to the Securities of this series (herein
called "Supplemental Indenture No. 1").

The Securities of this series shall not be subject to redemption at
the option of the Company at any time and the Company shall have no obligation
to redeem or purchase the Securities pursuant to any sinking fund.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the
indebtedness on this Security or of certain restrictive covenants and Events of

Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to
this Security.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be

permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of
all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security
shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of
this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer
hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

1 and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture or of Supplemental
Indenture No. 1 shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on, this
Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein
prescribed.

Company, the Trustee and the Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of
this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount of Securities of this series of a like tenor of a different authorized
denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

<PAGE>

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, whether or not the Security be overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any such agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF
LAWS.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
