September 7, 1994, Houston, Texas........Reading & Bates
Corporation (RB-NYSE) announced today that it has reached
agreement to purchase notes and interests representing 100% and
86% of lease debt outstanding in connection with the leveraged
leases of the drilling units "GEORGE H. GALLOWAY" and "C. E.
THORNTON", respectively, and 86% of the secured contingent
obligations in connection with the drilling unit "F. G.
McCLINTOCK", in a private transaction.

The consideration to be paid in connection with such
purchase will be approximately $9.0 million in cash and
approximately 4.2 million shares of the Company's common stock,
or approximately $34.5 million in total consideration at recent
stock prices.

Paul B. Loyd, Jr., the Company's Chairman and CEO said,
"This was an important purchase for the Company. It ensures long
term access to three 300 foot independent leg cantilever jackups
that have been leased by the Company, and it provides significant
reduction in our cost structure effective in 1996 or before,
compared to the lease and depreciation expense currently being
incurred on these three rigs. The sellers of the notes and
interests have achieved increased liquidity while retaining the
ability to participate in any recovery in the industry. So we
feel this was a true 'win-win' transaction."

Reading & Bates is a New York Stock Exchange listed company,
engaging in offshore drilling throughout the world. Its wholly
owned subsidiary, Reading & Bates Development Co., provides
technical, construction and project management services to the
upstream offshore oil and gas industry worldwide.
