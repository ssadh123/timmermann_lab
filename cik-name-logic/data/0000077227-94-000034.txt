ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As previously reported, on July 11, 1994 the

Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court reversed a March 1993 rate order

of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission permitting

Metropolitan Edison Company to recover from customers certain

future Three Mile Island Unit No. 2 retirement costs.

Consequently Pennsylvania Electric Company ("Penelec") recorded

pre-tax charges to income in the quarter ended June 30, 1994

totaling $56.3 million.

As a result of the Commonwealth Court decision, on

August 9, 1994, Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P") downgraded

its credit ratings for Penelec's first mortgage bonds and

cumulative preferred stock. S&P has assigned new ratings of A-

to Penelec's first mortgage bonds and BBB+ to its cumulative

preferred stock and shelf registration of monthly income

preferred securities. The previous ratings were A and A-,

respectively. S&P also revised its outlook for Penelec from

"negative" to "stable".

As previously reported in August 1994, Moody's

Investors Service ("Moody's") also downgraded the credit ratings

of Penelec's senior securities by one category. Duff & Phelps

has not changed Penelec's credit ratings following the

Commonwealth Court decision.
