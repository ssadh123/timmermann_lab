Item 5. Other Events

BellSouth Corporation reported a loss for the fourth
quarter of 56 cents. Adjusted for previously announced
restructuring and other charges that totaled $1.56 per share,
fourth quarter earnings would have been $1.00 per share.

The fourth quarter included one-time charges of $1.40 per
share for restructuring, 9 cents per share related to the initial
impact of the settlement of a rate proceeding in Florida, and 5
cents per share for debt refinancings, resulting in a reported net
loss of $276.0 million, or 56 cents per share. This compared with
reported net income of $353.4 million, or 72 cents per share, in
the same period of 1992. The new higher corporate income tax rate
decreased quarterly earnings by 2 cents per share in 1993.

For the year 1993, BellSouth reported earnings per share of
$1.77 compared with $3.30 in 1992. Excluding the effects of all
one-time and unusual items in both years, earnings per share of
$3.72 in 1993 increased 13 percent compared with earnings per share
$3.29 in 1992.

Revenues reached $4.12 billion in the fourth quarter of
1993, up 5.5 percent compared with the same quarter a year earlier.
Quarterly operating expenses increased just 0.6 percent, excluding
the restructuring and Florida settlement charges in 1993, and
expenses related to Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

The company reported an access line increase of 179,200
in the final three months of 1993, 38 percent higher than the
increase of 130,100 in the fourth quarter of 1992. For 1993 as a
whole, the number of BellSouth access lines serving customers
increased 684,600, surpassed only by the company's record increase
of 693,500 in 1987. BellSouth served 19,362,000 access lines at
the close of 1993.

U.S. cellular customers increased to 1,559,100 at year end,
up 39 percent from December 31, 1992. In BellSouth's eight
overseas cellular markets, customers increased during the year by
more than 114,000 or 148 percent, to 192,200. In Latin America, 96
percent customer growth helped the company's cellular operations
contribute positively to earnings in 1993.

For the year, BellSouth's reported net income, including
restructuring and one-time charges, was $880.1 million, compared
with $1.62 billion in 1992. Revenues of $15.9 billion in
1993 exceeded the previous year by $678 million, or 4.5 percent.
Annual operating expenses increased 3.2 percent, excluding the
impacts of the restructuring, Florida settlement and Hurricane
Andrew.

First quarter 1993 earnings will be restated to reflect an
accounting change related to the retroactive adoption of Statement
<PAGE>
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits." This new accounting standard covers
the accounting for certain benefits such as workers' compensation
and disability payments.

(A) In the fourth quarter of 1993, BellSouth adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." Because the change in accounting is retroactive to January 1, 1993,
results for the first quarter of 1993 have been restated to reflect the one-time
charge of $67.4 ($.14 per share) for adoption of the accounting standard.
