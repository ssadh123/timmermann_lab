if any, to be issued in exchange for Book-Entry Notes the Issuer
may execute, and upon receipt of an Issuer Order the Indenture
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, such Temporary Notes
which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or
otherwise produced, of the tenor of the Definitive Term Notes in

Register, comprising separate registers for each series of

registration of the Notes and the registration of transfers and
exchanges of the Notes. The Indenture Trustee shall initially

appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the Issuer shall give

times and to obtain copies thereof. The Indenture Trustee shall

the Note Registrar by an Executive Officer thereof as to the
names and addresses of the Noteholders and the principal amounts

(c) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of
any Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee

Trustee), the Issuer shall execute, the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture
Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Notes of the same series in any
authorized denominations of a like aggregate principal amount.

(d) At the option of the Noteholder, Notes may be ex-
changed for other Notes of the same series in any authorized
denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, upon
surrender of such Notes to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Indenture Trustee or the Agency Office of the
Issuer (and following the delivery, in the former case, of such
Notes to the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee), the Issuer shall
execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the
Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture Trustee, such Notes
which the Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

(e) All Notes issued upon any registration of
transfer or exchange of other Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

(f) Every Note presented or surrendered for registra-
tion of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed by, or be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Note Registrar,
duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney
duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or trust company located, or having a
correspondent located, in the City of New York or the city in
which the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee is
located, or by a member firm of a national securities exchange,
and such other documents as the Indenture Trustee may require.

(g) No service charge shall be made to a Holder for
any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the
Issuer or Indenture Trustee may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer
or exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Sections
2.3 or 9.6 not involving any transfer.

(h) The preceding provisions of this Section 2.4
notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to transfer or
make exchanges, and the Note Registrar need not register
transfers or exchanges, (i) of Notes that have been selected for
redemption pursuant to Article X, if applicable; (ii) of Notes
that are due for repayment within 15 days of submission to the

SECTION 2.5 MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN
NOTES.

(a) If (i) any mutilated Note is surrendered to the
Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee receives evidence to
its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note,
and (ii) there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee such
security or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in the absence
of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture
Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Issuer shall execute and upon the Issuer's
request the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in
exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Note, a replacement Note of a like series and
aggregate principal amount; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any such
destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note, shall
have become or within seven days shall be due and payable, or
shall have been called for redemption, instead of issuing a
replacement Note, the Issuer may make payment to the Holder of
such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or
upon the Redemption Date, if applicable, without surrender
thereof.

(b) If, after the delivery of a replacement Note or
payment in respect of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant
to subsection (a), a bona fide purchaser of the original Note in
lieu of which such replacement Note was issued presents for
payment such original Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee
shall be entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such
payment) from (i) any Person to whom it was delivered, (ii) the
Person taking such replacement Note from the Person to whom such
replacement Note was delivered or (iii) any assignee of such
Person, except a bona fide purchaser, and the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover upon the security
or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss,
damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee in connection therewith.

(c) In connection with the issuance of any
replacement Note under this Section 2.5, the Issuer may require
the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including
all fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee) connected
therewith.

(d) Any duplicate Note issued pursuant to this
Section 2.5 in replacement for any mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual
obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time or be
enforced by any Person, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any
and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

8<PAGE>

(e) The provisions of this Section 2.5 are exclusive
and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and
remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

SECTION 2.6 PERSONS DEEMED NOTEHOLDERS. Prior to
due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note, the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the
Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Note is
registered (as of the day of determination) as the Noteholder

interest on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever,

2.12, payment shall be made by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the account designated by such Holder.

(b) The principal of each series of Notes shall be
payable as provided in the applicable Officer's Issuance
Certificate. All principal payments on each series of Notes
shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders of such series
entitled thereto unless, with respect to any series of Revolving
Notes, otherwise provided in the related Officer's Issuance
Certificate or otherwise agreed among the Seller and the holders
of such Revolving Notes. Unless otherwise provided in the

final instalment of principal and interest on a series of Notes
is to be paid, the Indenture Trustee shall notify each
Noteholder of such series of Notes as of the Record Date for
such Payment Date of the fact that the final instalment of
principal of and interest on such Note is to be paid on such
Payment Date. With respect to Book-Entry Notes for which

sent on the Business Day prior to such Payment Date by
facsimile, and with respect to Definitive Term Notes and
Revolving Notes, such notice shall be sent not later than three
Business Days after such Record Date in accordance with Section
11.5(a), and, in each case, shall specify that such final in-
stalment shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender
of such Note and shall specify the place where such Note may be

Notes so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Indenture
Trustee. No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in
exchange for any Notes canceled as provided in this Section 2.8,
except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled
Notes may be held or disposed of by the Indenture Trustee in
accordance with its standard retention or disposal policy as in
effect at the time unless the Issuer shall direct by an Issuer
Order that they be returned to it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
Issuer Order is timely and the Notes have not been previously
disposed of by the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee
shall certify to the Issuer that surrendered Notes have been
duly cancelled and retained or destroyed, as the case may be.

provided in the applicable Officer's Issuance Certificate, each
series of Term Notes, upon original issuance, shall be issued in
the form of a typewritten Note or Notes representing the
Book-Entry Notes, to be delivered to The Depository Trust
Company, the initial Clearing Agency by or on behalf of the
Issuer and such Note or Notes shall be registered on the Note
Register in the name of the Note Depository (initially, Cede &
Co.). No Note Owner shall receive a Definitive Term Note
representing such Note Owner's interest in such Note, except as
provided in Section 2.12. Unless and until Definitive Term
Notes with respect to such Notes have been issued to such Note
Owners pursuant to Section 2.12, with respect to such Notes:

(a) the provisions of this Section 2.10 shall be
in full force and effect;

(b) the Note Registrar and the Indenture Trustee
shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all
purposes of this Indenture (including the payment of
principal of and interest on such Notes and the giving of
instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole Holder of
such Notes and shall have no obligation to such Note
Owners;

(c) to the extent that the provisions of this
Section 2.10 conflict with any other provisions of this
Indenture, the provisions of this Section 2.10 shall con-
trol;

exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be
limited to those established by law and agreements between
such Note Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the
Clearing Agency Participants, and unless and until
Definitive Term Notes are issued pursuant to Section 2.12,
the initial Clearing Agency shall make book-entry transfers
between the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and
transmit payments of principal of and interest on such
Notes to such Clearing Agency Participants, pursuant to the
Note Depository Agreement; and

(e) whenever this Indenture requires or permits
actions to be taken based upon instructions or directions
of Holders of Notes evidencing a specified percentage of
the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, the Clearing Agency
shall be deemed to represent such percentage only to the
extent that it has (i) received written instructions to
such effect from Note Owners and/or Clearing Agency
Participants owning or representing, respectively, such
required percentage of the beneficial interest in the Notes
and (ii) has delivered such instructions to the Indenture
Trustee.

SECTION 2.11 NOTICES TO CLEARING AGENCY. With
respect to any Term Notes issued as Book-Entry Notes, whenever
a notice or other communication to the Noteholders is required
under this Indenture, unless and until Definitive Term Notes
representing such Term Notes shall have been issued to the
related Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.12, the Indenture
Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to the related Noteholders to the Clearing
Agency and shall have no other obligation to such Note Owners.

SECTION 2.12 DEFINITIVE TERM NOTES. If for any Term
Notes issued as Book-Entry Notes (i) the Administrator advises
the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no
longer willing or able to properly discharge its
responsibilities with respect to such Notes and the Issuer is
unable to locate a qualified successor; (ii) the Administrator,
at its option, advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that it
elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing
Agency; or (iii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default or
a Servicing Default, Note Owners representing beneficial
interests aggregating at least a majority of the Outstanding
Amount of such Notes advise the Clearing Agency in writing that
the continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing
Agency is no longer in the best interests of such Note Owners,
then the Clearing Agency shall notify all Note Owners and the
Indenture Trustee of the occurrence of any such event and of the
availability of Definitive Term Notes to such Note Owners
requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Indenture Trustee of
the typewritten Note or Notes representing such Book-Entry Notes
by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration
instructions, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate the related Definitive Term Notes in accor-
dance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of the
Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be
liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may
conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such
instructions. Upon the issuance of such Definitive Term Notes,
the Indenture Trustee shall recognize the Holders of such
Definitive Term Notes as Noteholders.

12<PAGE>
<PAGE>19

SECTION 2.13 SELLER AS NOTEHOLDER. The Seller in
its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or
pledgee of Notes of any series and may otherwise deal with the
Issuer or its affiliates with the same rights it would have if
it were not the Seller.

SECTION 2.14 TAX TREATMENT. The Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee, by entering into this Indenture, and the
Noteholders and the Note Owners, by acquiring any Note or
interest therein, (i) express their intention that the Notes
qualify under applicable tax law as indebtedness secured by the
Collateral and (ii) unless otherwise required by appropriate
taxing authorities, agree to treat the Notes as indebtedness
secured by the Collateral for the purpose of federal income,
state and local income and franchise taxes, Michigan single
business tax, and any other taxes imposed upon, measured by or
based upon gross or net income.

SECTION 2.15 SPECIAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO SUBSEQUENT
TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN NOTES.

(a) The Revolving Notes shall not, and certain series
of Term Notes may not, be registered under the Securities Act,
or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Consequently,
such Notes (the "Unregistered Notes") shall not be transferable
other than pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and satisfaction of certain
other provisions specified herein or in the related Officer's
Issuance Certificate. Unless otherwise provided in the related
Officer's Issuance Certificate, no sale, pledge or other
transfer of any Unregistered Note (or interest therein) may be
made by any Person unless either (i) such sale, pledge or other
transfer is made to a "qualified institutional buyer" (as
defined under Rule 144A under the Securities Act) or to an
"institutional accredited investor" (as described in Rule
501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) and, if so
requested by the Seller or the Indenture Trustee, such proposed
transferee executes and delivers a certificate, substantially in
the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A or otherwise in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Seller,
or (ii) such sale, pledge or other transfer is otherwise made in
a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, in which case (A) the Indenture Trustee shall
require that both the prospective transferor and the prospective
transferee certify to the Indenture Trustee and the Seller in
writing the facts surrounding such transfer, which certification
shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee and the Seller, and (B) the Indenture Trustee shall
require a written opinion of counsel (which shall not be at the
expense of the Seller, the Servicer or the Indenture Trustee)
satisfactory to the Seller and the Indenture Trustee to the
effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act. 
Unless otherwise provided in the related Officer's Issuance
Certificate, no sale, pledge or other transfer of any Revolving
Note that is an Unregistered Note (or interest therein) may be
made by any Person unless the Seller shall have consented in
writing to such transfer. Neither the 

13<PAGE>
<PAGE>20

Seller nor the Indenture Trustee shall be obligated to register
any Unregistered Notes under the Securities Act, qualify any
Unregistered Notes under the securities laws of any state or
provide registration rights to any purchaser or holder thereof.

(b) The Unregistered Notes may not be acquired by or
for the account of a Benefit Plan. By accepting and holding an
Unregistered Note, the Holder thereof shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan and, if
requested to do so by the Seller or the Indenture Trustee, the
Holder of an Unregistered Note shall execute and deliver to the
Indenture Trustee an Undertaking Letter in the form set forth in
EXHIBIT B.

(c) Unless otherwise provided in the related
Officer's Issuance Certificate, Unregistered Notes shall be
issued in the form of Definitive Notes, shall be in fully
registered form and Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 of this
Indenture shall not apply thereto.

(d) Each Unregistered Note shall bear legends to the
effect set forth in subsections (a) and (b) above.

SECTION 3.1 PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. The
Issuer shall duly and punctually pay the principal of and
interest on the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Notes
and this Indenture. On each date on which any payments are to
be made, the Issuer shall cause amounts on deposit in the Note
Distribution Account and Revolver Distribution Account to be
paid to the Term Noteholders and Revolving Noteholders,
respectively, in accordance with the terms of the Notes and this
Indenture, less amounts properly withheld under the Code by any
Person from a payment to any Noteholder of interest and/or
principal. Any amounts so withheld shall be considered as
having been paid by the Issuer to such Noteholder for all
purposes of this Indenture.

SECTION 3.2 MAINTENANCE OF AGENCY OFFICE. As long
as any of the Notes remains outstanding, the Issuer shall
maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, an
office (the "Agency Office"), being an office or agency where
Notes may be surrendered to the Issuer for registration of
transfer or exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon
the Issuer in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be
served. The Issuer hereby initially appoints the Indenture
Trustee to serve as its agent for the foregoing purposes. The
Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the Indenture Trustee
of the location, and of any change in the location, of any such
office or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail to
maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the
Indenture Trustee with the address thereof, such surrenders,
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Indenture Trustee, and the Issuer hereby appoints

amounts due and payable with respect to any Notes that are to be
made from amounts withdrawn from the Note Distribution Account
or Revolver Distribution Account pursuant to Section 8.2(c)
shall be made on behalf of the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee
or by another Paying Agent, and no amounts so withdrawn from the

sums sufficient to pay the amounts then becoming due with
respect to the Term Notes and Revolving Notes, respectively,
such sums to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto.

(c) The Issuer shall cause each Paying Agent other
than the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to the
Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall
agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture Trustee
acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees), subject to the
provisions of this Section 3.3, that such Paying Agent shall:

(i) hold all sums held by it for the payment of
amounts due with respect to the Notes in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums
shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as
herein provided and pay such sums to such Persons as herein
provided;

(ii) give the Indenture Trustee notice of any default
by the Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Notes) of

respect to the withholding from any payments made by it on
any Notes of any applicable withholding taxes imposed
thereon and with respect to any applicable reporting

obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or
for any other purpose, by Issuer Order direct any Paying Agent
to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in trust by such
Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee upon
the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held by such
Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such money.

(e) Subject to applicable laws with respect to
escheat of funds, any money held by the Indenture Trustee or any
Paying Agent in trust for the payment of any amount due with
respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed for one year after
such amount has become due and payable shall be discharged from
such trust and be paid by the Indenture Trustee to the Issuer;
and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured
general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof
(but only to the extent of the amounts so paid to the Issuer),
and all liability of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent

Indenture Trustee if given by the Noteholders) setting forth the
Event or Events of Default, and upon any such declaration the
unpaid principal amount of such Notes, together with accrued and
unpaid interest thereon through the date of acceleration, shall
become immediately due and payable.

(b) At any time after such declaration of acceleration
of maturity has been made and before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Indenture
Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article V, the Holders
of Notes representing a majority of the Outstanding Amount of
the Notes, by written notice to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its
consequences; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such rescission and
annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Event of
Default or impair any right consequent thereto; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that if the Indenture Trustee shall have proceeded to
enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings
shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such
rescission and annulment or for any other reason, or shall have
been determined adversely to the Indenture Trustee, then and in
every such case, the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the
Noteholders, as the case may be, shall be restored to their
respective former positions and rights hereunder, and all
rights, remedies and powers of the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer
and the Noteholders, as the case may be, shall continue as
though no such proceedings had been commenced.

SECTION 5.3 COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS
FOR ENFORCEMENT BY INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

(a) The Issuer covenants that if there shall occur an
Event of Default under Sections 5.1(a), (b) or (c) that has not
been waived pursuant to Section 5.12, then the Issuer shall,
upon demand of the Indenture Trustee, pay to the Indenture
Trustee, for the ratable benefit of the Noteholders in
accordance with their respective principal amounts, the entire
amount then due and payable on the Notes for principal and
interest, with interest upon the overdue principal for each
series of Notes, at the rate borne by

29<PAGE>
<PAGE>36

such Notes and in addition thereto such further amount as shall
be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection,
including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Indenture Trustee and its agents and
counsel.

(b) If the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such
amounts upon such demand, the Indenture Trustee, in its own name
and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a Proceeding
for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce the same against the Issuer or other obligor upon such
Notes and collect in the manner provided by law out of the
property of the Issuer or other obligor upon such Notes,
wherever situated, the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.

(c) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing,
the Indenture Trustee may, as more particularly provided in
Section 5.4, in its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce
its rights and the rights of the Noteholders, by such
appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture Trustee shall deem most
effective to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein,
or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable
right vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture or by
applicable law.

(d) If there shall be pending, relative to the Issuer
or any other obligor upon the Notes or any Person having or
claiming an ownership interest in the Trust Estate, Proceedings
under any Insolvency Law, or if a receiver, assignee or trustee
in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or
similar official shall have been appointed for or taken
possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor
or Person, or in case of any other comparable judicial
Proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the
Notes, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such
other obligor, the Indenture Trustee, irrespective of whether
the principal of any Notes shall then be due and payable as
therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Indenture Trustee shall have made
any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.3, shall
be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such Proceedings
or otherwise:

(i) to file and prove a claim or claims for the
whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in
respect of the Notes and to file such other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have
the claims of the Indenture Trustee (including any claim
for reasonable compensation to the Indenture Trustee and
each predecessor trustee, and their respective agents,
attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all
expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made,
by the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor trustee,
except as a result of negligence or bad faith) and of the
Noteholders allowed in such Proceedings;

30<PAGE>
<PAGE>37

(ii) unless prohibited by applicable law and
regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders of Notes in
any election of a trustee, a standby trustee or Person
performing similar functions in any such Proceedings;

(iii) to collect and receive any monies or other
property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to
distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims
of the Noteholders and of the Indenture Trustee on their
behalf; and

(iv) to file such proofs of claim and other
papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in
order to have the claims of the Indenture Trustee or the
Holders of Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings
relative to the Issuer, its creditors and its property;

and any trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other
similar official in any such Proceeding is hereby authorized by
each of such Noteholders to make payments to the Indenture
Trustee, and, if the Indenture Trustee shall consent to the
making of payments directly to such Noteholders, to pay to the
Indenture Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover
reasonable compensation to the Indenture Trustee, each
predecessor trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and
counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and
all advances made, by the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor
trustee except as a result of negligence or bad faith.

(e) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
authorize the Indenture Trustee to authorize or consent to or
vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to
authorize the Indenture Trustee to vote in respect of the claim
of any Noteholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid,
to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar
Person.

(f) All rights of action and of asserting claims
under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced
by the Indenture Trustee without the possession of any of the
Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other
Proceedings relative thereto, and any such Proceedings
instituted by the Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own
name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of
judgment, subject to the payment of the expenses, disbursements
and compensation of the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor
trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for
the ratable benefit of the Noteholders.

(g) In any Proceedings brought by the Indenture
Trustee (and also any Proceedings involving the interpretation
of any provision of this Indenture to which the Indenture
Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall be held
to represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be necessary
to make any Noteholder a party to any such Proceedings.

SECTION 5.4 REMEDIES; PRIORITIES.

(a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and the Notes have been accelerated under Section
5.2(a), the Indenture Trustee may (but shall not be required to)
do one or more of the following (subject to Section 5.5):

(i) institute Proceedings in its own name and as
trustee of an express trust for the collection of all
amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture
with respect thereto, whether by declaration of
acceleration or otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained,
and collect from the Issuer and any other obligor upon such
Notes monies adjudged due;

(ii) institute Proceedings from time to time for
the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture with
respect to the Trust Estate;

(iii) exercise any remedies of a secured party
under the UCC and take any other appropriate action to
protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders; and

(iv) sell the Trust Estate or any portion thereof
or rights or interest therein, at one or more public or
private sales called and conducted in any manner permitted
by law or elect to have the Issuer maintain possession of
the Trust Estate, including the Receivables included
therein, and continue to apply Collections on such
Receivables as if there had been no declaration of
acceleration;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indenture Trustee may not sell or
otherwise liquidate the Trust Estate following an Event of
Default and acceleration of the Notes, unless (A) the Holders of
all of the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Notes consent
thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation distribut-
able to the Securityholders are sufficient to discharge in full
the principal of and the accrued interest on the Notes and the
Certificate Balance of and accrued interest on the Certificates,
in each case as of the date of such sale or liquidation or
(C) (i) there has been an Event of Default under Section 5.1(a),
(b) or (c) or otherwise arising from a failure to make a
required payment of principal on any Notes, (ii) the Indenture
Trustee determines that the Trust Estate will not continue to
provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and
interest on the Notes as and when they would have become due if
the Notes had not been declared due and payable and (iii) the
Indenture Trustee obtains the consent of Holders of a majority
of the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Notes. In
determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to
clauses (B) and (C), the Indenture Trustee may, but need not,
obtain and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment
banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of
the Trust Estate for such purpose.

32<PAGE>
<PAGE>39

(b) If the Indenture Trustee collects any money or
property pursuant to this Article V, it shall pay out the money
or property in the following order:

FIRST: to the Indenture Trustee for amounts due
under Section 6.7; and

SECOND: to the Collection Account for
distribution pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement.

SECTION 5.5 OPTIONAL PRESERVATION OF THE TRUST
ESTATE. If the Notes have been declared to be due and payable
under Section 5.2 following an Event of Default and such
declaration and its consequences have not been rescinded and
annulled, the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, elect to take
and maintain possession of the Trust Estate. It is the desire
of the parties hereto and the Noteholders that there be at all
times sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and
interest on the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take such
desire into account when determining whether or not to take and
maintain possession of the Trust Estate. In determining whether
to take and maintain possession of the Trust Estate, the
Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an
opinion of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm
of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed
action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such
purpose.

SECTION 5.6 LIMITATION OF SUITS. No Holder of any
Note shall have any right to institute any Proceeding, judicial
or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the
appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy
hereunder, unless:

(i) such Holder has previously given written
notice to the Indenture Trustee of a continuing Event of
Default;

(ii) the Holders of not less than 25% of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes have made written request
to the Indenture Trustee to institute such Proceeding in
respect of such Event of Default in its own name as
Indenture Trustee hereunder;

(iii) such Holder or Holders have offered to the
Indenture Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs,
expenses and liabilities to be incurred in complying with
such request;

(iv) the Indenture Trustee for 60 days after its
receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has
failed to institute such Proceedings; and

33<PAGE>
<PAGE>40

(v) no direction inconsistent with such written
request has been given to the Indenture Trustee during such
60-day period by the Holders of a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes;

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of
Notes shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of,
or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect,
disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Notes or
to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other Holders of Notes or to enforce any right under this
Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the
equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Notes. For
the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section
5.6, each and every Noteholder shall be entitled to such relief
as can be given either at law or in equity.

If the Indenture Trustee shall receive conflicting or
inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or more groups of
Holders of Notes, each representing less than a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes, the Indenture Trustee in its
sole discretion may determine what action, if any, shall be
taken, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture.

SECTION 5.7 UNCONDITIONAL RIGHTS OF NOTEHOLDERS TO
RECEIVE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. Notwithstanding any other
provisions in this Indenture, the Holder of any Note shall have
the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive
payment of the principal of and interest on such Note on or
after the respective due dates thereof expressed in such Note or
in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, if applicable,
on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be
impaired without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 5.8 RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. If
the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any
Proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture
and such Proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any
reason or has been determined adversely to the Indenture Trustee
or to such Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuer,
the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any
determination in such Proceeding, be restored severally and to
their respective former positions hereunder, and thereafter all
rights and remedies of the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders
shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been instituted.

34<PAGE>
<PAGE>41

SECTION 5.9 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No
right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the
Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and
in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 5.10 DELAY OR OMISSION NOT A WAIVER. No
delay or omission of the Indenture Trustee or any Holder of any
Note to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Default
or Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or
an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article V or by law to the Indenture Trustee or to the Notehold-
ers may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be
deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the
Noteholders, as the case may be.

SECTION 5.11 CONTROL BY NOTEHOLDERS. The Holders of
a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes shall, subject
to provision being made for indemnification against costs,
expenses and liabilities in a form satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee, have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to the
Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes or exercising any
trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that:

(i) such direction shall not be in conflict with
any rule of law or with this Indenture;

(ii) subject to the express terms of Section 5.4,
any direction to the Indenture Trustee to sell or liquidate
the Trust Estate shall be by the Holders of Notes repre-
senting not less than 100% of the Outstanding Amount of the
Notes;

(iii) if the conditions set forth in Section 5.5
have been satisfied and the Indenture Trustee elects to
retain the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 5.5, then any
direction to the Indenture Trustee by Holders of Notes
representing less than 100% of the Outstanding Amount of
the Notes to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall be of
no force and effect; and

(iv) the Indenture Trustee may take any other
action deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee that is not
inconsistent with such direction;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, subject to Section 6.1, the Indenture
Trustee need not take any action that it determines might cause
it to incur any liability (a) with respect to which the
Indenture Trustee shall have reasonable grounds to believe that 

35<PAGE>
<PAGE>42

adequate indemnity against such liability is not assured to it
and (b) which might materially adversely affect the rights of
any Noteholders not consenting to such action.

SECTION 5.12 WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. 

(a) Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of
the maturity of the Notes as provided in Section 5.2, the
Holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of
the Notes may waive any past Default or Event of Default and its
consequences except a Default (i) in the payment of principal of
or interest on any of the Notes or (ii) in respect of a covenant
or provision hereof that cannot be modified or amended without
the consent of the Holder of each such Note. In the case of any
such waiver, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall be restored to their former positions and
rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend
to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

(b) Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to
exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred,
and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to
have been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of
this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any
right consequent thereto.

SECTION 5.13 UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS. All parties to
this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Note by such
Holder's acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that
any court may in its discretion require, in any Proceeding for
the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or
in any Proceeding against the Indenture Trustee for any action
taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any
party litigant in such Proceeding of an undertaking to pay the
costs of such Proceeding, and that such court may in its discre-
tion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, against any party litigant in such Proceeding, having due
regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses
made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section
5.13 shall not apply to:

(a) any Proceeding instituted by the Indenture
Trustee;

(b) any Proceeding instituted by any Noteholder, or
group of Noteholders, in each case holding in the aggregate more
than 10% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes; or

(c) any Proceeding instituted by any Noteholder for
the enforcement of the payment of principal of or interest on
any Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such
Note and in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, on or
after the Redemption Date).

<PAGE>43

SECTION 5.14 WAIVER OF STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS. The
Issuer covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it shall not at any time insist upon, or plead or in any manner
whatsoever, claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay
or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter
in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of
this Indenture. The Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully
do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any
such law, and covenants that it shall not hinder, delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the
Indenture Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

SECTION 5.15 ACTION ON NOTES. The Indenture
Trustee's right to seek and recover judgment on the Notes or
under this Indenture shall not be affected by the seeking,
obtaining or application of any other relief under or with
respect to this Indenture. Neither the lien of this Indenture
nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by
the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any
execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Trust
Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer. Any money or
property collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in
accordance with Section 5.4(b) hereof.

SECTION 5.16 PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN
OBLIGATIONS.

(a) Promptly following a request from the Indenture
Trustee to do so and at the Administrator's expense, the Issuer
agrees to take all such lawful action as the Indenture Trustee
may request to compel or secure the performance and observance
by the Seller and the Servicer of their respective obligations

Servicing Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or

legal or administrative actions or proceedings to compel or
secure performance by the Seller or the Servicer of each of
their obligations under the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement.

continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, and, at the direction
(which direction shall be in writing or by telephone (confirmed
in writing promptly thereafter)) of the Holders of 66-2/3% of
the Outstanding Amount of the Notes shall, exercise all rights,
remedies, powers, privileges and claims of the Issuer against
the Seller or the Servicer under or in connection with the Trust
Sale and Servicing Agreement, including the right or power to

THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

SECTION 6.1 DUTIES OF INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall exercise the rights and
powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of
care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such
person's own affairs, including without limitation, continuing
to hold the Trust Estate and receive collections on the
Receivables included therein and provided in the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement.

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of
Default:

(i) the Indenture Trustee undertakes to perform
such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Indenture and the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Indenture or the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement against the Indenture Trustee; and

(ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the
Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of
the statements and the correctness of the opinions ex-
pressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to
the Indenture Trustee and conforming to the requirements of
this Indenture; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indenture
Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to
determine whether or not they conform to the requirements
of this Indenture.

(c) The Indenture Trustee may not be relieved from
liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent
failure to act or its own wilful misconduct, except that:

(i) this Section 6.1(c) does not limit the
effect of Section 6.1(b);

for any error of judgment made in good faith by a
Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the Indenture

with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in
good faith in accordance with a direction received by it

<PAGE>46

(e) Money held in trust by the Indenture Trustee need
not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required

Indenture Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
incur financial liability in the performance of any of its
duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or
powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that
repayments of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk
or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

faith in reliance on such Officer's Certificate or Opinion of
Counsel.

become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with
the Issuer, the Servicer or any of their respective Affiliates
with the same rights it would have if it were not Indenture
Trustee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indenture Trustee shall
comply with Sections 6.10 and 6.11. Any Paying Agent, Note
Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with

occurs and is continuing and if it is known to a Responsible
Officer of the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall
mail to each Noteholder notice of the Default within 90 days
after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in payment of
principal of or interest on any Note, the Indenture Trustee may
withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its
Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding
the notice is in the interests of Noteholders.

SECTION 6.6 REPORTS BY INDENTURE TRUSTEE TO
HOLDERS. The Indenture Trustee shall deliver to each Noteholder
the information and documents set forth in Article VII, and, in
addition, all such information with respect to the Notes as may

expenses of administration under any Insolvency Law.

of its intent to resign by so notifying the Issuer; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such resignation shall become effective and the

of the Notes may remove the Indenture Trustee by so notifying
the Indenture Trustee and may appoint a successor Indenture
Trustee. Such resignation or removal shall become effective in

Indenture Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly appoint and
designate a successor Indenture Trustee.

(c) A successor Indenture Trustee shall deliver a
written acceptance of its appointment and designation to the
retiring Indenture Trustee and to the Issuer. Thereupon the
resignation or removal of the retiring Indenture Trustee shall
become effective, and the successor Indenture Trustee shall have
all the rights, powers and duties of the Indenture Trustee under
this Indenture. The successor Indenture Trustee shall mail a
notice of its succession to Noteholders. The retiring Indenture
Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as
Indenture Trustee to the successor Indenture Trustee.

jurisdiction for the removal of the Indenture Trustee and the
appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee.

Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.8, the Issuer's obligations
under Section 6.7 and the Servicer's corresponding obligations
under the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement shall continue for
the benefit of the retiring Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 6.9 MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF INDENTURE
TRUSTEE.

succeeding to the corporate trust business of the Indenture
Trustee, shall be the successor of the Indenture Trustee under
this Indenture; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such corporation shall
be eligible under the provisions of Section 6.11, without the
execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the
part of any of the parties to this Indenture, anything in this
Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding.

(b) If at the time such successor or successors by
merger or consolidation to the Indenture Trustee shall succeed
to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Notes shall
have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to
the Indenture Trustee may adopt the certificate of
authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such
Notes so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the
Notes shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the
Indenture Trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the name
of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to
the Indenture Trustee. In all such cases such certificate of
authentication shall have the same full force as is provided
anywhere in the Notes or herein with respect to the certificate
of authentication of the Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 6.10 APPOINTMENT OF CO-INDENTURE TRUSTEE OR
SEPARATE INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

<PAGE>50

Issuer, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity
and for the benefit of the Noteholders and (only to the extent
expressly provided herein) the Certificateholders, such title to
the Issuer, or any part hereof, and, subject to the other
provisions of this Section 6.10, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Indenture Trustee may
consider necessary or desirable. No co-trustee or separate
trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of
eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 6.11 and no
notice to Noteholders of the appointment of any co-trustee or
separate trustee shall be required under Section 6.8.

(b) Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the
following provisions and conditions:

(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations
conferred or imposed upon the Indenture Trustee shall be
conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the
Indenture Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee
jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or
co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the
Indenture Trustee joining in such act), except to the
extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any
particular act or acts are to be performed the Indenture
Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such
act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
obligations (including the holding of title to the Issuer
or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be
exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or
co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Indenture
Trustee;

(ii) no trustee hereunder shall be personally
liable by reason of any act or omission of any other
trustee hereunder; and

(iii) the Indenture Trustee may at any time accept
the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or
co-trustee.

Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of
the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if
given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate
trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Indenture and the
conditions of this Article VI. Each separate trustee and
co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall
be vested with the estates or property specified in its
instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Indenture
Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to
all the provisions of this Indenture, specifically including
every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct of,
affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the
Indenture Trustee. Every such instrument shall be filed with
the Indenture Trustee.

time appoint the Indenture Trustee as its agent or
attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent
not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect
of this Indenture on its behalf and in its name. If any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of
acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties,
rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by
the Indenture Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without
the appointment of a new or successor trustee.

performance or ability to perform its duties under this
Indenture or on the transactions contemplated in this Indenture;

(d) the execution, delivery and performance by the

decline to follow any such direction if the Indenture Trustee,
being advised by counsel, determines that the action so directed
may not lawfully be taken, or if the Indenture Trustee in good
faith shall, by a Responsible Officer, determine that the
proceedings so directed would be illegal or subject it to
personal liability or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of
Noteholders not parties to such direction; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right

upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such
supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this

or otherwise.

and the Issuer, to any such supplemental indenture may be
prepared and executed by the Issuer and authenticated and
delivered by the Indenture Trustee in exchange for Outstanding
Notes of the same series.

each Person signing such certificate as to the fair value

securities proposed to be released and stating that in the
opinion of such Person the proposed release will not impair

(iv) Whenever the Issuer is required to furnish
to the Indenture Trustee an Officer's Certificate
certifying or stating the opinion of any signatory thereof
as to the matters described in clause (b)(iii) above, the
Issuer shall also furnish to the Indenture Trustee an

Receivables or Defaulted Receivables, or securities
released from the lien of this Indenture since the
commencement of the then current calendar year, as set
forth in the certificates required by clause (b)(iii) above
and this clause (b)(iv), equals 10% or more of the

<PAGE>67

the Certificate Distribution Account as and to the extent
permitted or required by the Basic Documents and (C) take any
other action not inconsistent with the TIA.

SECTION 11.2 FORM OF DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TO
INDENTURE TRUSTEE. 

(a) In any case where several matters are required to
be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified
Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified
by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that
they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some
matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters,
and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such
matters in one or several documents.

(b) Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized
Officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to
legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or repre-
sentations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the
exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or
opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon
which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any
such certificate of an Authorized Officer or Opinion of Counsel
may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a
certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or
officers of the Servicer, the Seller, the Issuer or the
Administrator, stating that the information with respect to such
factual matters is in the possession of the Servicer, the
Seller, the Issuer or the Administrator, unless such counsel
knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that
the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to
such matters are erroneous.

(c) Where any Person is required to make, give or
execute two or more applications, requests, consents,
certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under
this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form
one instrument.

(d) Whenever in this Indenture, in connection with
any application or certificate or report to the Indenture
Trustee, it is provided that the Issuer shall deliver any
document as a condition of the granting of such application, or
as evidence of the Issuer's compliance with any term hereof, it
is intended that the truth and accuracy, at the time of the
granting of such application or at the effective date of such
certificate or report (as the case may be), of the facts and
opinions stated in such document shall in such case be
conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to have such
application granted or to the sufficiency of such certificate or
report. The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to
affect the Indenture Trustee's right to rely upon the truth and
accuracy of any statement or opinion contained in any such
document as provided in Article VI.

SECTION 11.3 ACTS OF NOTEHOLDERS.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this
Indenture to be given or taken by Noteholders or a series of
Noteholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such
Noteholders in person or by agents duly appointed in writing;
and except as herein otherwise expressly provided such action
shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are
delivered to the Indenture Trustee, and, where it is hereby
expressly required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or
instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced
thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the
Noteholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any
such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture
and (subject to Section 6.1) conclusive in favor of the
Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided
in this Section 11.3.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person
of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner
that the Indenture Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the
Note Register.

(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any
Notes (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) shall bind the
Holder of every Note issued upon the registration thereof or in
exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything
done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Indenture Trustee or
the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Note.

SECTION 11.4 NOTICES, ETC., TO INDENTURE TRUSTEE,
ISSUER AND RATING AGENCIES. Any request, demand, authorization,

(a) the Indenture Trustee by any Noteholder or by the
Issuer shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made,
given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Indenture
Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or

62<PAGE>
<PAGE>69

(b) the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or by any
Noteholder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if in
writing and either sent by electronic facsimile transmission
(with hard copy to follow via first class mail) or mailed, by
certified mail, return receipt requested to the Issuer and the
Owner Trustee, care of the Owner Trustee at its Corporate Trust
Office and to Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation, 3044 West
Grand Boulevard, Detroit, Michigan 48202, Attention: J. B. Van
Orman, Vice President or at any other address previously
furnished in writing to the Indenture Trustee by the Issuer.

The Issuer shall promptly transmit any notice received
by it from the Noteholders to the Indenture Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee shall likewise promptly transmit any notice
received by it from the Noteholders to the Issuer.

(c) Notices required to be given to the Rating Agen-
cies by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee

SECTION 11.5 NOTICES TO NOTEHOLDERS; WAIVER.

(a) Where this Indenture provides for notice to
Noteholders of any condition or event, such notice shall be
sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided)
if it is in writing and mailed, first-class, postage prepaid to
each Noteholder affected by such event, at such Person's address
as it appears on the Note Register, not later than the latest
date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the
giving of such notice. If notice to Noteholders is given by
mail, neither the failure to mail such notice nor any defect in
any notice so mailed to any particular Noteholder shall affect
the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other
Noteholders, and any notice that is mailed in the manner herein
provided shall conclusively be presumed to have been duly given
regardless of whether such notice is in fact actually received.

(b) Where this Indenture provides for notice in any
manner, such notice may be waived in writing by any Person
entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the
event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. 
Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the
Indenture Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition
precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon
such a waiver.

63<PAGE>
<PAGE>70

(c) In case, by reason of the suspension of regular
mail service as a result of a strike, work stoppage or similar
activity, it shall be impractical to mail notice of any event of
Noteholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to
any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such
notice as shall be satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee shall
be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

(d) Where this Indenture provides for notice to the
Rating Agencies, failure to give such notice shall not affect
any other rights or obligations created hereunder, and shall not
under any circumstance constitute an Event of Default.

SECTION 11.6 ALTERNATE PAYMENT AND NOTICE
PROVISIONS.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture or any
of the Notes to the contrary, the Issuer may enter into any
agreement with any Holder of a Note providing for a method of
payment, or notice by the Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent
to such Holder, that is different from the methods provided for
in this Indenture for such payments or notices. The Issuer
shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee a copy of each such
agreement and the Indenture Trustee shall cause payments to be
made and notices to be given in accordance with such agreements.

SECTION 11.7 CONFLICT WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT.

(a) If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or
conflicts with another provision hereof that is required to be
included in this Indenture by any of the provisions of the TIA,
such required provision shall control.

(b) The provisions of TIA 310 through 317 that impose
duties on any Person (including the provisions automatically
deemed included herein unless expressly excluded by this
Indenture) are a part of and govern this Indenture, whether or
not physically contained herein.

interest in any part of the Trust Estate, any benefit or any

SECTION 11.12 LEGAL HOLIDAYS.

Notes or this Indenture) payment need not be made on such date,

in lieu of, other Series 1994-A Term Notes pursuant to
the Indenture) is $1,250,000,000.

C. The following terms used in the Indenture, the

Date; PROVIDED that (i) the Controlled
Deposit Amount for the Series 1994-A Term
Notes for any Distribution Date (together
with the Controlled Deposit Amount for any
other series of Term Notes for such

Trust Principal shall be applied in the
following order of priority:

(a) first, to the Series 1994-A

zero;

Term Notes until the Outstanding

the Controlled Deposit Amount on the Series 1994-A Term
Notes and, subject to the applicable Controlled Deposit
Amount, if any, for such Term Notes, before, together

be paid pursuant to Section 8.2(g) of the
Indenture on the first Distribution Date
related to such Early Amortization Period).

Series 1994-A Term Notes for any
Distribution Date shall not exceed the
Outstanding Amount of the Series 1994-A Term
Notes less amounts on deposit in the Note
Distribution Account for the payment of
principal on the Series 1994-A Term Notes.

F. The Series 1994-A Term Notes are not subject to
optional or mandatory purchase or redemption by the Issuer.

THIS POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT is made as of
January 25, 1994, between GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION, a
corporation incorporated under the New York Banking Law relating to
investment companies (referred to herein as "GMAC" in its capacity
as seller of the Receivables specified herein and as the "SERVICER"
in its capacity as servicer of the Receivables), and WHOLESALE AUTO
RECEIVABLES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "PURCHASER").

WHEREAS, GMAC, in the ordinary course of its business,
generates certain payment obligations by financing the floor plan
inventory of motor vehicle dealers;

WHEREAS, GMAC desires to sell and assign to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase from GMAC, certain
of such existing and future payment obligations arising or acquired

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to transfer and assign its
interest in such payment obligations to Superior Wholesale
Inventory Financing Trust I (the "ISSUER") pursuant to the Trust
Sale and Servicing Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Issuer desires to issue the Initial
Securities to fund its acquisition of such payment obligations;

WHEREAS, the Purchaser, the Issuer and GMAC (as the
holder of such payment obligations not sold to the Purchaser
hereunder) desire that the Servicer shall service such payment
obligations; and

WHEREAS, the Servicer is willing to service such payment
obligations and related payment obligations in accordance with the
terms hereof and of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement for the
benefit of the Purchaser, GMAC, the Issuer and each other party
identified or described herein or in the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement as having an interest therein as owner, trustee, secured
party or holder of the Securities (all such parties being

PURCHASE AND SALE OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES

SECTION 2.01. PURCHASE AND SALE OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES.

(a) By execution of this Agreement, on the Initial
Closing Date, GMAC does hereby sell, transfer, assign and otherwise
convey to the Purchaser, without recourse, all of its right, title
and interest in, to and under all of the Eligible Receivables
existing in the Accounts listed on the Schedule of Accounts (which
is kept at locations listed in EXHIBIT A) as of the close of
business on the Initial Cut-Off Date and all monies due or to
become due thereon after the Initial Cut-Off Date, all Collateral
Security with respect thereto and all amounts received with respect
thereto and all proceeds thereof (including "proceeds" as defined
in Section 9-306 of the UCC and Recoveries). 

(b) Subject to Section 6.02, as of each date during the
Revolving Period on which Receivables are created or deemed created
in the Accounts in the Pool of Accounts, GMAC does hereby sell,
transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, without
recourse, all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all
Eligible Receivables created or deemed created in the Accounts in
the Pool of Accounts on such date and all monies due or to become
due thereon after such date, all Collateral Security with respect
thereto and all amounts received with respect thereto and all
proceeds thereof (including "proceeds" as defined in Section 9-306
of the UCC and Recoveries). 

(c) It is the intention of GMAC and the Purchaser that
the transfers and assignments contemplated by this Agreement shall
constitute sales of the property described in Sections 2.01(a) and
(b) from GMAC to the Purchaser and that the beneficial interest in
and title to such property shall not be part of GMAC's estate in
the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against GMAC
under any Insolvency Law. The foregoing sales, transfers, assign-
ments and conveyances and any subsequent sales, transfers, assign-
ments and conveyances contemplated hereby do not constitute, and
are not intended to result in, the creation or an assumption by the
Purchaser of any obligation of the Servicer, GMAC (if GMAC is not
the Servicer), General Motors or any other Person in connection
with the Receivables described above or under any agreement or
instrument relating thereto, including any obligation to any
Dealers.

(d) Subject to Section 2.06 and Article III hereof, GMAC
shall retain all right, title and interest in, to and under the
Receivables in the Accounts in the Pool of Accounts that GMAC has
not transferred to the Purchaser hereunder. Such Receivables,
together with any Receivables repurchased by GMAC or (so long as

- 2 -
<PAGE>6

GMAC is the Servicer) the Servicer from the Purchaser or the Trust
pursuant to this Agreement or the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement, all monies due or to become due on such Receivables, all
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof
(including "proceeds" as defined in Section 9-306 of the UCC and
Recoveries) are collectively referred to herein as the "RETAINED
PROPERTY".

SECTION 2.02. PURCHASE PRICE. On the Initial Closing
Date, in consideration for the sale of the property described in
Section 2.01(a) to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall pay to GMAC
$2,232,260,228.40 (representing the aggregate principal balance of
the Receivables as of the close of business on the Initial Cut-Off
Date so sold on the Initial Closing Date) in immediately available
funds, and GMAC shall deliver to the Purchaser an executed
assignment substantially in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto. The
Purchaser shall pay, subject to Section 6.02, for property
described in Section 2.03 sold by GMAC to the Purchaser on each
Addition Date and property described in Section 2.01(b) sold by
GMAC to the Purchaser on each Receivables Purchase Date, a price
equal to the principal balance of the Eligible Receivables to be
purchased on each such date. Such purchase price shall be payable
by the Purchaser on each such date in immediately available funds. 

SECTION 2.03. ADDITION OF ACCOUNTS. 

(a) OFFERS TO DESIGNATE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS. From time
to time, GMAC may, at its option, offer to designate and the
Purchaser may, at its option, request the designation of, one or
more Accounts (each, an "ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT") to be included as
Accounts in the Pool of Accounts, subject to the conditions
specified in Section 2.03(b) below. If the Purchaser, at its
option, elects to accept any such offer by GMAC or if GMAC, at its
option, agrees to any such request of the Purchaser, GMAC shall
sell and assign to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase
from GMAC, all of GMAC's right, title and interest in, to and under
all of the Eligible Receivables in each such Additional Account as
of the related Additional Cut-Off Date and all monies due or to
become due thereon after such date, all Collateral Security with
respect thereto, all amounts received with respect thereto and all
proceeds thereof (including "proceeds" as defined in Section 9-306
of the UCC and Recoveries), effective as of the Addition Date
specified in a written notice provided by the Servicer, on behalf
of GMAC, to the Purchaser (the "GMAC ADDITION NOTICE"). Effective
as of each such Addition Date, such Additional Account shall be
included in the Pool of Accounts and Eligible Receivables arising
therein from and after the Additional Cut-Off Date shall be subject
to purchase under Section 2.01(b) above. Each GMAC Addition Notice
shall specify the related Additional Cut-Off Date and shall be
given (with a copy to the Rating Agencies) on or before the fifth
Business Day but not more than the thirtieth day prior to the
related Addition Date.

of Accounts as so amended shall be true and correct as of the
Addition Date;

(vi) GMAC shall have delivered to the Purchaser a

SECTION 2.04. OPTIONAL REMOVAL OF ACCOUNTS. From time
to time, GMAC may, at its option, request from the Purchaser, and
the Purchaser may, at its option, offer to GMAC, the right to
designate an Account for removal from the Pool of Accounts.

<PAGE>8

Account for removal by furnishing a written notice (the "GMAC
REMOVAL NOTICE") to the Purchaser not less than five Business Days
but not more than 30 days prior to the Removal Commencement Date. 
On and after the Removal Commencement Date with respect to a
Selected Account, GMAC shall not transfer Receivables with respect
to such Selected Account to the Purchaser. The Schedule of
Accounts shall be amended to reflect such designation as of the
Removal Commencement Date and to reflect such Account becoming a
Removed Account as of the Removal Date. At any time after the
Removal Date, at the written request of GMAC, the Purchaser shall
assign to GMAC, without recourse, representation or warranty,
effective as of the Removal Date, all of the Purchaser's right,
title and interest in, to and under the Receivables arising in such
Account and related Collateral Security.

SECTION 2.05. REMOVAL OF INELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS. If at
any time an Account shall be deemed a Selected Account as described
in Section 2.9 of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Purchaser shall give notice thereof to GMAC at the time it gives
notice to the parties identified in such Section 2.9. From and
after the Removal Commencement Date with respect to a Selected
Account pursuant to such Section 2.9, GMAC shall not transfer
Receivables with respect to such Selected Account to the Purchaser. 
The Schedule of Accounts shall be amended to reflect such
designation as of the Removal Commencement Date and to reflect such
Account becoming a Removed Account as of the Removal Date. At any
time after such removal, at the written request of GMAC, the
Purchaser shall assign to GMAC, without recourse, representation or
warranty, effective as of the Removal Date, all of the Purchaser's
right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables in such
Account and related Collateral Security.

SECTION 2.06. CUSTODY OF DOCUMENTATION. In connection
with the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of the
Receivables and related Collateral Security in the Accounts in the
Pool of Accounts to the Purchaser hereunder, the Purchaser is
executing simultaneously herewith the Custodian Agreement with the
Custodian, pursuant to which the Purchaser shall revocably appoint
the Custodian to act as agent of the Purchaser to maintain custody
of the documents and instruments (as more fully described in the
Custodian Agreement) associated with such Receivables, which shall
be constructively delivered to the Purchaser. GMAC, as the holder
of the Retained Property, hereby consents to the appointment of the
Custodian to act as agent of GMAC to maintain custody of the
documents and contracts (as more fully described in the Custodian
Agreement) associated with the Receivables included therein and is
simultaneously herewith executing the Custodian Agreement. The
Custodian has accepted such appointment by the Purchaser and GMAC
under the Custodian Agreement.

ARTICLE III

ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF RECEIVABLES

SECTION 3.01. APPOINTMENT OF SERVICER AND ACCEPTANCE OF
APPOINTMENT. The Purchaser and GMAC hereby appoint the Servicer to
act as Servicer with respect to the Eligible Receivables and the
Receivables included in the Retained Property, existing in or
arising under the Accounts included in the Pool of Accounts from
time to time and authorize the Servicer to perform the duties of
Servicer under this Agreement and under the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement. The Servicer by execution of this Agreement
and by execution of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement hereby
accepts such appointment and the terms hereof and thereof.

SECTION 3.02. RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE SERVICER. 

(a) The Servicer shall manage, service and administer
the Receivables described in Section 3.01, including, without
limitation, collecting payments due under the Receivables and
providing for charge-offs of uncollectible Receivables, with
reasonable care and all in accordance with the Servicer's customary
and usual servicing procedures for servicing wholesale receivables
comparable to the Receivables which the Servicer services for its
own account, including the Floor Plan Financing Guidelines, except
insofar as any failure to do so would not have a material adverse
effect on the interests of Securityholders. The Servicer shall
have full power and authority, acting alone or through any party
properly designated by it hereunder or under the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement, to do any and all things in connection with
such servicing and administration which it may deem necessary or
desirable, including monitoring the insurance maintained by
Dealers. The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its own
name or in the name of any Interested Party, a Proceeding to
enforce any Receivable subject hereto, to enforce all obligations
of GMAC and the Purchaser under this Agreement and under the Trust
Sale and Servicing Agreement or to commence or participate in a
Proceeding (including without limitation a bankruptcy proceeding)
relating to or involving any such Receivable. If in any Proceeding
it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Receivable arising
under an Account in the Pool of Accounts on the ground that it is
not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce such
Receivable, the Purchaser, GMAC and each other Interested Party
shall, at the Servicer's expense, take such steps as the Servicer
reasonably deems necessary or appropriate to enforce the
Receivable, including bringing suit in the name of such Person. If
the Servicer commences or participates in such a Proceeding in its
own name, each Interested Party shall thereupon be deemed to have
automatically assigned such Receivable to the Servicer for purposes
of commencing or participating in any such Proceeding as a party or
claimant, and the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to
execute and deliver in the Servicer's name any notices, demands,
claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or
instruments in connection with any such Proceeding. Each 

- 6 -

<PAGE>10

Interested Party shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of
attorney and other documents and take any other steps which the
Servicer may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to enable the
Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under
this Agreement and the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement. Except
to the extent required by the preceding two sentences, the
authority and rights granted to the Servicer in this Section 3.02
shall be nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in
derogation of the retention by any Interested Party (to the extent
of its rights in a Receivable) of equivalent authority and rights. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to any
Servicing Default, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered,
unless such power and authority is revoked by any Interested Party
on account of the occurrence of such a Servicing Default, to:

(i) instruct the Issuer to make allocations,
withdrawals and payments to or from the Collection Account,
the Distribution Accounts, the Reserve Fund and any other
related bank accounts as set forth in the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement;

(ii) instruct the Issuer or any Interested Party to
take any action required or permitted under any Specified
Support Arrangement;

(iii) execute and deliver, on behalf of the Issuer
for the benefit of any related Securityholders, any and all
instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or
full release or discharge, and all other comparable instru-
ments, with respect to the Receivables and, after the delin-
quency of any Receivable and to the extent permitted under and
in compliance with applicable requirements of law, to commence
enforcement proceedings with respect to any such Receivable;
and

(iv) make any filings, reports, notices, applica-
tions, registrations with, and seek any consents or
authorizations from, the Securities and Exchange Commission
and any State securities authority on behalf of the Issuer as
may be necessary or advisable to comply with any federal or
State securities law or reporting requirement.

(b) The Servicer shall not be obligated to use separate
servicing procedures, offices, employees or accounts for servicing
the Receivables in the Accounts in the Pool of Accounts from the
procedures, offices, employees and accounts used by the Servicer in
connection with servicing other receivables. The Servicer shall,
at its own expense, on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, in the
case of the Initial Accounts, and on or prior to the applicable
Addition Date, in the case of Additional Accounts, indicate in its
computer files that the Eligible Receivables in the Accounts in the
Pool of Accounts have been sold and transferred by GMAC to the
Purchaser hereunder and by the Purchaser to the Trust under the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement. 

- 7 -
<PAGE>11

(c) Except as otherwise required to comply with all
Requirements of Law, the Servicer may change the terms and provi-
sions of the Floor Plan Financing Agreements or the Floor Plan
Financing Guidelines in any respect (including the calculation of
the amount or the timing of charge-offs and the rate of the finance
charge assessed thereon), only if:

(i) in the reasonable belief of the Servicer, no
Early Amortization Event shall occur as a result of such
change;

(ii) such change is made applicable to the
comparable segment of any similar portfolio of accounts
serviced by the Servicer and not only to the Accounts in the
Pool of Accounts; and

(iii) in the case of a reduction in the rate of such
finance charges, the Servicer (and, if GMAC is not then the
Servicer, GMAC) does not reasonably expect any such reduction,
after considering amounts due and amounts payable under any
Specified Support Agreements and Investment Proceeds for the
related period, to result in the Net Receivables Rate for any
Collection Period being less than the sum of (A) the weighted
average of the rates of interest payable to all holders of
Securities and (B) the Monthly Servicing Fee for the related
period;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall prevent the Servicer
from modifying the terms of the Floor Plan Financing Agreement with
any dealer on a case-by-case basis in a manner consistent with the
Floor Plan Financing Guidelines.

SECTION 3.03. SERVICING COMPENSATION; PAYMENT OF CERTAIN
EXPENSES BY THE SERVICER. The Servicer is entitled to receive the
Monthly Servicing Fee as described in the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement. The Monthly Servicing Fee shall be payable to the
Servicer solely to the extent amounts are available for payment in
accordance with the terms of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agree-
ment. Subject to any limitations on the Servicer's liability under
the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Servicer shall be
required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its
activities under this Agreement and the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement (including disbursements of the Issuer, fees and
disbursements of any trustees, accountants and outside auditors,
taxes imposed on the Servicer, expenses incurred in connection with
distributions and reports to holders of Securities and all other
fees and expenses not expressly stated under this Agreement or the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreements to be for the account of the
holders of Securities, but in no event including federal, state and
local income and franchise taxes, if any, of the Issuer or any
holder of the Securities).

SECTION 3.04. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS
OF THE SERVICER. 

(a) The Servicer hereby makes, and any successor
Servicer by its appointment under this Agreement and under the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement shall make, on each Closing Date
(and on the date of any such appointment) the following representa-
tions, warranties and covenants on which the Purchaser relies in
accepting and holding the Receivables and the related Collateral
Security hereunder and the Issuer shall rely in acquiring and
holding such Receivables and the related Collateral Security under
the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement and in issuing the
Securities:

(i) ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. The Servicer
has been duly organized and is validly existing as a
corporation in good standing under the New York Banking Law
relating to investment companies (or, in the case of a
Servicer other than GMAC, other applicable law of its
jurisdiction of incorporation), with power and authority to
own its properties and to conduct its businesses as such
properties are presently owned and such businesses are
presently conducted. 

(ii) DUE QUALIFICATION. The Servicer is duly
qualified to do business and, where necessary, is in good
standing as a foreign corporation (or is exempt from such
requirement) and has obtained all necessary licenses and
approvals in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
businesses requires such qualification, except where the
failure to so qualify or obtain licenses or approvals would
not have material adverse effect on its ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

(iii) POWER AND AUTHORITY. The Servicer has the
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, to carry out the terms
of each such agreement and to service the Accounts in the Pool
of Accounts and the Receivables arising therein as provided
herein and in the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, and the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement have been duly authorized
by the Servicer by all necessary corporate action on the part
of the Servicer.

(iv) BINDING OBLIGATION. This Agreement constitutes,
and the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, when duly executed
and delivered by the Servicer, shall constitute, the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Servicer enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or
hereinafter in effect, affecting the enforcement of creditors'

- 9 -

<PAGE>13

rights in general and by general principles of equity, regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law.

(v) NO VIOLATION. The execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement by the
Servicer and the fulfillment of the terms of this Agreement
and the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement by the Servicer,
shall not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the
terms and provisions of or constitute (with or without notice
or lapse of time) a default under, the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Servicer, or any indenture,
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument to
which the Servicer is a party or by which it is bound, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of
its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument (other
than pursuant to the Basic Documents), or violate any law or,
to the best of the Servicer's knowledge, any order, rule or
regulation applicable to the Servicer of any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the Servicer or any of its
properties, except where any such conflict or violation would
not have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement.

(vi) NO PROCEEDINGS. To the Servicer's knowledge,
there are no Proceedings or investigations pending, or
threatened, against the Servicer before any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the Servicer or its
properties (A) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or
the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement or any Securities
issued thereunder, (B) seeking to prevent the issuance of the
such Securities, the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement or (C)
seeking any determination or ruling that might materially and
adversely affect the performance by the Servicer of its

warranties to the Purchaser as to the Accounts in the Pool of

included in the Pool of Accounts is an Eligible Account; 

(ii) as of the Initial Cut-Off Date, each Receivable

<PAGE>17

(iv) as of each date that Receivables are sold and
transferred hereunder pursuant to Section 2.01(b), each
Receivable that is identified as an Eligible Receivable and so
conveyed to the Purchaser on such date is an Eligible
Receivable.

(b) SURVIVAL; NOTICE OF BREACH. The representations and
warranties set forth in this Section 4.01 shall survive the
transfer and assignment of the Eligible Receivables in the Accounts
in the Pool of Accounts and related items to the Purchaser from
time to time and the subsequent assignment and transfer of its
interests therein to the Issuer pursuant to the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement. Upon discovery by GMAC or the Purchaser of a
breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in
this Section 4.01, the party discovering such breach shall give
prompt written notice to the other party.

shall assign its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to the

that (i) in the event of a breach of any of GMAC's representations
and warranties contained in Section 4.01(a) with respect to any

any Receivable or (ii) in the event that the payment of all or a
portion of the principal amount of any Receivable held by the
Purchaser or the Trust is deferred pursuant to DPP, WISP or any

to the extent such breach or deferral shall have been cured in all
material respects, GMAC shall repurchase the interest of the Issuer
in such Receivable (to the extent of such breach or deferral) on
the date and for the amount specified in Section 2.5 of the Trust
Sale and Servicing Agreement, without further notice from the
Purchaser hereunder and without any representation, warranty or
recourse from the Purchaser or the Issuer. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, a Receivable shall not be an Eligible
Receivable, and thus shall be subject to repurchase, if and to the
extent that, (A) the Servicer adjusts downward the principal amount
of such Receivable because of a rebate, refund, credit adjustment
or billing error to the related Dealer or (B) such Receivable was
created in respect of a Vehicle which was refused or returned by
the related Dealer.

(d) SOLE REMEDY. The obligation of GMAC to repurchase
any Receivable shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the

ISSUANCE OF INITIAL SECURITIES

SECTION 2.1 CONVEYANCE OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES. 

(a) In consideration of the Issuer's delivery on the

RN1 Revolving Notes and Class A Certificates with an initial
Certificate Balance of $132,000,000 to, or upon the order of, the
Seller, the Seller does hereby enter into this Agreement and agree
to fulfill all of its obligations hereunder and does hereby sell,
transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the Issuer, without
recourse (except as expressly provided herein), pursuant to an
assignment in the form of EXHIBIT A hereto, on the Initial Closing
Date (i) all of its right, title and interest in, to and under all
of the Eligible Receivables existing in the Accounts listed on the
Schedule of Accounts (which is on file at the locations set forth
in EXHIBIT B) as of the close of business on the Initial Cut-Off
Date and all monies due or to become due thereon after the Initial
Cut-Off Date, all Collateral Security with respect thereto and all
amounts received with respect thereto, (ii) all of its right, title
and interest in, to and under Article IV and Sections 3.04(c) and
6.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to such
Receivables, including the right of the Seller to cause GMAC or the
Servicer to repurchase Receivables under certain circumstances,

(c) It is the intention of the Seller and the Issuer
that the transfers and assignments contemplated by this Agreement
shall constitute sales of the property described in Sections 2.1(a)
and (b) from the Seller to the Issuer and that the beneficial
interest in and title to such property shall not be part of the
Seller's estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition
by or against the Seller under any Insolvency Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that such transfers and assignments did not constitute
such sales or that such beneficial interest is a part of the
Seller's estate, then the Seller shall be deemed to have granted to
the Issuer a first priority perfected security interest in all of
the Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under such
property, and the Seller hereby grants such security interest. For
purposes of such grant, this Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under the UCC. The foregoing sales, transfers,
assignments and conveyances and any subsequent sales, transfers,
assignments and conveyances do not constitute, and are not intended
to result in, the creation or an assumption by the Issuer of any
obligation of the Seller or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables described above or under any agreement or instrument
relating thereto, including any obligation to any Dealers. 

(d) Within two Business Days after the Initial Closing
Date, GMAC, as directed by the Seller in Section 3.06 of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall cause to be deposited into
the Collection Account the collections with respect to the
Receivables described in Section 3.06 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

SECTION 2.2 CUSTODY OF DOCUMENTATION. In connection
with the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of the
Receivables in the Accounts in the Pool of Accounts and related
Collateral Security to the Issuer hereunder, GMAC, as Custodian
under the Custodian Agreement, agrees to act as Custodian
thereunder for the benefit of the Issuer. The Issuer hereby
accepts and agrees to the terms and provisions of the Custodian
Agreement and designates GMAC as custodian with respect to the
documents and instruments (as more fully described in the Custodian
Agreement) associated with the Receivables related to the Accounts
in the Pool of Accounts.

SECTION 2.3 ACCEPTANCE BY THE ISSUER; OTHER
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

(a) The Issuer hereby acknowledges its acceptance of all
right, title and interest previously held by the Seller to the
property, now existing and hereafter created, conveyed by the
Seller pursuant to Section 2.1, and declares that it shall hold
such consideration upon the trust set forth in the Trust Agreement
for the benefit of the Securityholders, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Indenture, the Trust Agreement and this
Agreement. The Issuer hereby agrees and accepts the appointment 
- 3 -

<PAGE>8

and authorization of GMAC as Servicer hereunder and under the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Issuer further acknowledges
that, prior to or simultaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Seller delivered to the Trustee the Schedule of
Accounts. The parties agree that the rights, duties and
obligations of GMAC as Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement are subject to the provisions hereof, including Sections
7.2, 7.4, 7.5 and 10.2 and Article VIII. The Trust and the
Indenture Trustee hereby confirm the authorization and empowerment
of the Servicer under Section 3.02 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

(b) The Issuer acknowledges and agrees to the provisions
of Section 6.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to
Common Collateral and accepts the interests and rights in
Collateral Security sold and assigned to it hereunder subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in such Section 6.03.

SECTION 2.4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES UNDER THE
POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT. The Seller hereby represents and
warrants to the Issuer that the Seller has taken no action which
would cause the representations and warranties of GMAC in Section
4.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be false in any
material respect. The foregoing representation and warranty speaks
as of the Initial Cut-Off Date (as to Sections 4.01(a)(i) and
(ii)), as of the related Additional Cut-Off Date with respect to
each Additional Account (as to Section 4.01(a)(iii)) and as of the
related Receivables Purchase Date with respect to Receivables
purchased and sold after the Initial Closing Date (as to Section
4.01(a)(iv)), and shall survive the sales, transfers and
assignments under Section 2.1 to the Issuer and the pledge of the
Issuer's assets to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture. 
The Seller further acknowledges that the Issuer relies on the
representations and warranties of the Seller under this Agreement
and of GMAC under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in accepting
the Receivables hereunder and delivering the Securities. The
Servicer acknowledges that the Issuer is relying on the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Servicer in
Section 3.04 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in acquiring
and holding Receivables and the related Collateral Security
hereunder and in issuing the Securities.

SECTION 2.5 REPURCHASE OF RECEIVABLES UPON BREACH OF
WARRANTY; ADMINISTRATIVE RECEIVABLES. 

(a) Upon discovery by the Seller, the Servicer, the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee (i) of a breach of any of
the representations and warranties in Section 4.01(a) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement or in Section 2.4 or Section 3.1 of
this Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests
of the Trust in any Receivable or (ii) that the payment of all or
any portion of the principal amount of any Receivable held by the 

- 4 -

<PAGE>9

Trust is deferred pursuant to DPP, WISP or any other instalment
sales program or similar arrangement, the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice thereof to the others. No
later than the second Business Day following discovery or receipt
of notice of breach or deferral by the Seller and the Servicer,
unless and to the extent, in the case of breach, such breach shall
have been cured in all material respects, in the event of a breach
of the representations and warranties made by the Seller in Section
2.4 or Section 3.1(b), the Seller shall repurchase such Receivable,
or in the event of a breach of a representation and warranty under
Section 4.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or a
deferral, the Seller and the Servicer shall use reasonable efforts
to enforce the obligation of GMAC under Section 4.01(a) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement to repurchase such Receivable from
the Issuer on such date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to
any breach of a representation or warranty or a deferral that
affects less than the entire principal amount of any Receivable,
although the Warranty Payment shall be paid promptly as described
below, no repurchase and assignment shall be required until the
remaining principal amount of such Receivable is collected in full
or written off as uncollectible. The purchase price to be paid by
the Seller or GMAC shall be an amount equal to the principal amount
of such Receivable (in the case of a breach or a deferral affecting
less than the entire principal amount of a Receivable, to the
extent of the breach or deferral) plus all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon through the date of purchase (the "WARRANTY
PAYMENT") to the extent of such breach of deferral, a "Warranty
Receivable") and shall be deposited into the Collection Account on
such date of purchase. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, a Receivable shall not be an Eligible Receivable, and
thus shall be a Warranty Receivable and subject to repurchase, if
and to the extent that (A) the Servicer adjusts downward the
principal amount of such Receivable because of a rebate, refund,
credit adjustment or billing error to the related Dealer or (B)
such Receivable was credited in respect of a Vehicle which was
refunded or returned by the related Dealer. It is understood and
agreed that the obligation of GMAC or the Seller, as applicable, to
repurchase any Receivable as to which a breach of a representation
or warranty made in Section 2.4 or Section 3.1 hereof or Section
4.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement has occurred and is
continuing or as to which any such deferral occurs, and the
obligation of the Seller and the Servicer to enforce GMAC's
obligation to repurchase such Receivable pursuant to the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement shall constitute the sole remedy against
the Seller, the Servicer or GMAC for such breach or deferral
available to the Issuer, the Securityholders, the Owner Trustee or
the Indenture Trustee. 

(b) The Servicer also acknowledges its obligations to
repurchase from the Issuer Administrative Receivables pursuant to
Section 3.04(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Upon
discovery by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee of a breach

- 5 -

<PAGE>10

of any of the covenants of the Servicer in Sections 3.04(a)(viii),
(ix) or (x) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, such party
shall give prompt written notice to the other, the Servicer and the
Seller.

(c) Upon each payment of the Administrative Purchase
Payment or the Warranty Payment with respect to a Receivable,
except as provided in Section 2.5, the Trust shall automatically
and without further action be deemed to have sold, transferred,
assigned and otherwise conveyed to the Seller or Servicer, as
appropriate, without recourse, representation or warranty, as of
the date of such payment, all right, title and interest of the
Trust in, to and under such Receivable, all monies due or to become
due with respect thereto on and after such payment date and all
proceeds thereof and, if such repurchase is made in connection with
the repurchase hereunder of all other Receivables in the related
Account held by the Trust, the related Collateral Security. The
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall execute such
documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as shall be reasonably requested by Seller or the
Servicer, as the case may be, to evidence such conveyance.

SECTION 2.6 COVENANTS. The Seller hereby covenants
that:

(a) NEGATIVE PLEDGE. Except for the conveyances
hereunder and the pledge of the Trust Estate to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture, and as provided in Section 6.03
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Seller shall not sell,
pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist, any Lien on any Eligible
Receivable in any Account in the Pool of Accounts (and any related
Vehicle Collateral Security), whether now existing or hereafter
created, or any interest therein, or the Seller's rights, remedies,
powers or privileges under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
conveyed to the Trust hereunder and the Seller shall defend the
right, title and interest of the Trust and any Interested Party in,
to and under such property, whether now existing or hereafter
created against all claims of third parties claiming through or
under the Seller. The Seller shall notify the Issuer promptly
after becoming aware of any Lien on such property other than the
conveyances contemplated hereunder.

(b) DELIVERY OF COLLECTIONS. If the Seller or GMAC
receives payments by or on behalf of a Dealer in respect of
Receivables in any Account in the Pool of Accounts or any
Collateral Security (except as contemplated in Section 6.03 of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to any property
constituting Common Collateral that is not Vehicle Collateral
Security in connection with Other Indebtedness), the Seller and
GMAC shall deliver such payments to the Servicer as soon as
practicable after receipt thereof, but in no event later than two
Business Days after the receipt thereof.
- 6 -

<PAGE>11

(c) POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT MATTERS. If GMAC
breaches any of its covenants in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.05,
5.01, 6.01(a), 7.01 or 7.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
and such breach has a material adverse effect on the interests of
the Securityholders, WARCO shall enforce its rights under the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement arising from such breach.

SECTION 2.7 ADDITION OF ACCOUNTS.

(a) VOLUNTARY ADDITION. The Seller may from time to
time, in its sole discretion, subject to the conditions specified
in Section 2.7(b) below, designate one or more Accounts as
Additional Accounts to be included in the Pool of Accounts by
giving (or causing the Servicer to give on its behalf) a written

Agencies specifying the Additional Cut-Off Date and the Addition

on or before the fifth Business Day but not more than the thirtieth

Addition Date, the Seller shall sell and assign to the Trust, and
the Trust shall purchase from the Seller, all of the Seller's
right, title and interest in, to and under the Eligible Receivables

more fully described in the assignment referred to in subsection

such transfer nor is either of them aware of any pending
insolvency;

(v) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been
satisfied with respect to such addition for each series or

(vi) the Seller shall represent and warrant that the
designation of such Additional Accounts, the inclusion of such
Additional Accounts in the Pool of Accounts and the purchase
of the related Receivables shall not, in the reasonable belief
of the Seller, result in the occurrence of an Early
Amortization Event;

(vii) the Schedule of Accounts shall have been amended to
reflect such Additional Accounts and the Schedule of Accounts
as so amended shall be true and correct as of the Addition
Date;

(viii) the Seller shall have delivered to the Indenture

SECTION 2.8 OPTIONAL REMOVAL OF ACCOUNTS. 

(a) The Seller shall have the right from time to time as
described in this Section 2.8 to require the removal of Accounts
from the Pool of Accounts. To so remove Accounts, the Seller (or
the Servicer on its behalf) shall take the following actions and
make the following determinations:

(i) not less than five Business Days but not more than
30 days prior to the Removal Commencement Date, furnish to the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Rating Agencies
a written notice (the "REMOVAL NOTICE") specifying the date
(the "REMOVAL COMMENCEMENT DATE") on which removal of one or
more Accounts will commence (the "SELECTED ACCOUNTS"); and

(ii) determine on the Removal Commencement Date with
respect to such Selected Accounts the aggregate principal
balance of Eligible Receivables in respect of each such
Selected Account (the "REMOVAL BALANCE") and amend the
Schedule of Accounts by delivering to the Owner Trustee a true
and complete list of the Selected Accounts, specifying for
each Selected Account as of the Removal Commencement Date its
account number and the Removal Balance.

- 8 -

<PAGE>13

(b) The removal of any of such Accounts shall be subject
to the following conditions:

(i) the Seller shall represent and warrant that such
removal shall not, in the reasonable belief of the Seller,
result in the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event;

(ii) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been

forth in Section 2.8(b), from and after the Removal Commencement
Date with respect to a Selected Account, (i) the Seller shall not
transfer Receivables with respect to such Selected Account to the
Trust, and (ii) until the Removal Balance has been reduced to zero 
all Principal Collections with respect to such Selected Account
shall be allocated to the oldest outstanding principal balance of
Receivables arising under such Selected Accounts and amounts so
allocated to Receivables owned by the Trust shall constitute Trust
Principal Collections and shall reduce the Removal Balance. The
Removal Balance shall also be reduced to the extent Receivables in
the Selected Accounts held by the Trust on the Removal Commencement
Date become Defaulted Receivables.

(d) After the Removal Balance with respect to any such
Selected Account is reduced to zero, Collections thereon shall
cease to be allocated in accordance with 2.8(c) and such Selected
Account shall be deemed removed from the Pool of Accounts for all
purposes (a "REMOVED ACCOUNT") and the Servicer shall amend the
Schedule of Accounts accordingly. At any time after the date (the
"REMOVAL DATE") on which the Removal Balance is reduced to zero
with respect to a Removed Account, the Owner Trustee shall assign
to the Seller, without recourse, representation or warranty,
effective as of the Removal Date all of the Trust's right, title
and interest in, to and under the Receivables arising in such
Account and related Collateral Security.

SECTION 2.9 REMOVAL OF INELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS. 

(a) On or before the fifth Business Day after the date
on which an Account becomes an Ineligible Account (which Business
Day shall be deemed to be the Removal Commencement Date with
respect to such Account) such Account shall be deemed a Selected
Account. Within five Business Days after the Removal Commencement
Date with respect to any Account that became a Selected Account

pursuant to this Section 2.9, the Seller shall furnish a Removal
Notice to the Trustee stating that the Removal Commencement Date
for such Ineligible Account has occurred and specifying for each
such Selected Account as of the Removal Commencement Date its
account number and the Removal Balance. The Schedule of Accounts
shall be amended to reflect such designation as of the Removal
Commencement Date.

(b) From and after the Removal Commencement Date with
respect to a Selected Account subject to this Section 2.9, the
Seller shall not transfer Receivables with respect to such Selected
Account to the Trust and, until the Removal Balance has been
reduced to zero, all Principal Collections with respect to such
Selected Account shall be allocated to the oldest outstanding
principal balance of Receivables arising under such Selected
Account and amounts so allocated to Receivables owned by the Trust
shall constitute Trust Principal Collections. After the Removal
Balance with respect to any such Selected Account has been reduced
to zero, Collections thereon shall cease to be allocated in
accordance with the preceding sentence and such Selected Account
shall be a Removed Account and the Servicer shall amend the
Schedule of Accounts accordingly. At any time after the Removal
Date with respect to such Removed Account, the Owner Trustee shall
assign to the Seller, without recourse, representation or warranty,
effective as of the Removal Date, all of the Trust's right, title
and interest in, to and under the Receivables arising in such

there are no Proceedings or investigations pending, or

Eligible Receivables in the Accounts included in the Pool of
Accounts pursuant to this Agreement the Seller had good and
marketable title to such Receivables, free of any Lien; and,

the Issuer shall have all of the right, title and interest of
the Seller in, to and under the Eligible Receivables in the
Accounts included in the Pool of Accounts, free of any Lien.

(ii) ALL FILINGS MADE. All filings (including,
without limitation, UCC filings) necessary in any jurisdiction
to give the Issuer a first priority perfected ownership
interest in the Eligible Receivables in the Accounts in the
Pool of Accounts shall have been made.

(c) REASSIGNMENT OF ALL RECEIVABLES. 

(i) If any representation or warranty under Section
3.1(a) or (b) is not true and correct as of the date specified
therein and such breach has a material adverse effect on the
interests of the Securityholders, then any of the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the holders of outstanding
Securities evidencing not less than a majority of the Out-
standing Amount and a majority of the Voting Interests of all
outstanding Certificates, by written notice to the Seller with
a copy to the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner

by the Trust and the related Collateral Security, subject to
the payment to the Trust of the Reassignment Amount, the Trust

sell, transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the Seller,
without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right,
title and interest of the Trust in and to such Receivables and
such related Collateral Security. Each of the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee shall execute such documents and
instruments of transfer or assignment and take such other
actions as they shall reasonably be requested by the Seller to

Collateral Security) in the event of a breach of a
representation or warranty made in Section 3.1(a) or (b) has
occurred and is continuing and the obligation of the Seller to
pay the Reassignment Amount therefor shall, if such
obligations are fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against
the Seller for such breach available to the Issuer, the
Securityholders, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 3.2 LIABILITY OF SELLER. The Seller shall be
liable in accordance with this Agreement only to the extent of the
obligations in this Agreement specifically undertaken by the

contemplated by the Basic Documents or pursuant to the Intercompany
Advance Agreement (without giving effect to any amendment to the
Intercompany Advance Agreement after the date hereof, unless the
Rating Agency Condition for each series or class of Securities then
outstanding was satisfied in connection therewith) if such action
would result in a downgrading of the then current rating of any
outstanding series or class of Securities by a Rating Agency for
such series or class.

SECTION 3.4 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF SELLER AND
OTHERS.

(a) Neither the Seller nor any of the directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Seller in its capacity as such
shall be under any liability to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee, the Securityholders or any other Person, except
as specifically provided in this Agreement, for any action taken or
for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to the Basic
Documents or from errors in judgment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this
provision shall not protect the Seller or any such Person against
any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of wilful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except errors in judgment) in
the performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties under the Basic Documents. The Seller and
any director or officer or employee or agent of the Seller may rely
in good faith on the advice of counsel or on any document of any
kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person
respecting any matters arising under the Basic Documents. 

(b) The Seller and any director, officer, employee or
agent of the Seller shall be reimbursed by the Owner Trustee for
any contractual damages, liability or expense incurred by reason of
such trustee's wilful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except
errors in judgment) in the performance of such trustee's duties
under such agreement or the Trust Agreement or by reason of
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under such
agreements. The Seller shall not be under any obligation to appear
in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is not incidental to
its obligations as Seller of the Receivables and related Collateral
Security under this Agreement and that in its opinion may involve
it in any expense or liability.

effect that such firm has audited the financial statements of the
Servicer and issued its report thereon and that such audit (i) was

(ii) included tests relating to wholesale receivables (including
financing arrangements with automobile dealers to finance their
automobile and light-duty truck inventory) serviced for others in

provide to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee reasonable
access to the documentation regarding the Accounts in the Pool of
Accounts and the Receivables arising thereunder. The Servicer
shall provide such access to any Securityholder only in such cases
where a Securityholder is required by applicable statutes or
regulations to review such documentation. In each case, such access
shall be afforded without charge but only upon reasonable request
and during normal business hours at offices of the Servicer
designated by the Servicer. Nothing in this Section 4.3 shall
derogate from the obligation of the Servicer to observe any
applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information regarding any
Dealer, and the failure of the Servicer to provide access as
provided in this Section 4.3 as a result of such obligation shall
not constitute a breach of this Section 4.3.

SECTION 4.4 ENFORCEMENT OF RECEIVABLES. If in any
Proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a
Receivable that has been transferred to the Trust on the ground
that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to

Trustee, as applicable, shall, at the Servicer's expense, take such
steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce such Receivable,
including bringing suit in the name of such Person or the names of 

- 17 -

<PAGE>22

the Securityholders. The Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee
agree to the provisions of Section 3.02 of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement as such provisions apply to Interested Parties
(as used therein).

SECTION 4.5 ALLOCATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS.

(a) The Trust, as the holder of the Receivables
transferred hereunder, shall be entitled to Principal Collections
and Interest Collections to the extent of Trust Principal
Collections and Trust Interest Collections and GMAC, as the holder
of the Retained Property, shall be entitled to such Principal
Collections and Interest Collections in excess thereof. Any
Principal Collections or Interest Collections on deposit in the
Collection Account which do not represent Trust Principal
Collections or Trust Interest Collections shall be paid to GMAC as
holder of the Retained Property.

(b) The Servicer shall calculate, in a manner consistent
with the Indenture (including all Officer's Issuance Certificates)
and the Trust Agreement, (i) no later than each Determination Date,
Available Trust Interest, the Monthly Servicing Fee, Aggregate
Noteholders' Interest, Revolver Interest, Aggregate
Certificateholders' Interest and any payment due under any
Specified Support Arrangement and (ii) no later than each
Determination Date for the Wind Down Period, an Early Amortization
Period, the Payment Period for any series of Term Notes or, if
principal payments are then required to be made (or set aside)
under any Revolving Notes, the Revolving Period, Available Trust
Principal, Aggregate Noteholders' Principal, Aggregate
Certificateholders' Principal, the Required Revolver Payment,
unreimbursed Trust Charge-Offs and the Trust Defaulted Amount and
in each case, all other amounts required to determine the amounts
to be deposited in or paid from each of the Collection Account, the
Note Distribution Account, the Revolver Distribution Account, the
Certificate Distribution Account and the Reserve Fund on the next
succeeding Distribution Date. The Servicer shall calculate on a
daily basis the Daily Trust Balance, the Daily Trust Invested
Amount and all related amounts to the extent necessary to determine
the Cash Collateral Amount for such date as described in Section
4.5(d).

(c)(i) With respect to each Distribution Date and the
related Collection Period, the Indenture Trustee (based on the
information contained in the Servicer's Accounting delivered
on the related Determination Date pursuant to Section 3.05 of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) shall apply Available
Trust Interest in the following amounts and in the following
priority:

(A) to the Servicer, an amount equal to the Monthly
Servicing Fee for such Distribution Date;

- 18 -

<PAGE>23

(B) (1) to the Note Distribution Account, an amount
equal to the Aggregate Noteholders' Interest for such
Distribution Date, (2) to the Revolver Distribution
Account, an amount equal to the Revolver Interest for
such Distribution Date and (3) to or for the account of
the applicable counterparty under each Specified Support
Arrangement, the payment due (or to be set aside for
payment) for such Distribution Date in accordance with
the terms of such arrangement;

(C) to the Certificate Distribution Account, an
amount equal to the Aggregate Certificateholders'
Interest for such Distribution Date;

(D) to the Servicer, an amount equal to any
Servicer Advances not previously reimbursed;

(E) an amount equal to any Trust Defaulted Amount
for such Distribution Date shall be treated as Additional
Trust Principal for such Distribution Date;

(F) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
unreimbursed Trust Charge-Offs shall be treated as
Additional Trust Principal for such Distribution Date;
and

(G) to the Reserve Fund, an amount equal to any
Reserve Fund Deposit Amount for such Distribution Date.

(ii) To the extent Available Trust Interest for a
Distribution Date is insufficient to make all of the
applications described in Sections 4.5(c)(i)(A) through (D),
there shall be a Deficiency Amount. If there is a Deficiency
Amount for such Distribution Date, the Servicer shall make a
Servicer Advance equal to such Deficiency Amount to complete
the applications pursuant to such Sections, to the extent the
Servicer, in its sole discretion, expects to recover such
Servicer Advance from Available Trust Interest to be applied
on future Distribution Dates as described above. The Servicer
shall have no obligation to make any Servicer Advances to the
extent it does not expect to recover such Servicer Advances. 
To the extent the Available Trust Interest for a Distribution
Date (calculated after the adjustment, if any, to Trust
Interest Collections described in subsection (v) below) plus
the Servicer Advance, if any, made for such Distribution Date
are insufficient to make the full amounts of the applications
described in Sections 4.5(c)(i)(A) through (E), there shall be
an Unsatisfied Deficiency Amount. If there is an Unsatisfied
Deficiency Amount for such Distribution Date, the Servicer
shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to withdraw funds from
the Reserve Fund and apply such funds to reduce such 

- 19 -

<PAGE>24

Unsatisfied Deficiency Amount in the priorities set forth in
Sections 4.5(c)(i)(A) through (E); provided, that no amount
shall be withdrawn from the Reserve Fund and paid to the
Servicer pursuant to Section 4.5(c)(i)(D) in order to
reimburse the Servicer for advances with respect to
Receivables that are not Eligible Receivables (as determined
by the Servicer in accordance with its servicing procedures). 
To the extent that, after application of the funds in the
Reserve Fund, the full amount of the Trust Defaulted Amount
has not been treated as Additional Trust Principal pursuant to
Section 4.5(c)(i)(E), the amount of such deficiency shall be
added to unreimbursed Trust Charge-Offs.

(iii) To the extent any Available Trust Interest
(calculated after the adjustment, if any, to Trust Interest
Collections described in subsection (v) below) is available on
any Distribution Date after making the applications described
in Section 4.5(c)(i), such amount shall be allocated and paid
to the Seller as compensation for making the initial and
other, if any, deposits into the Reserve Fund.

(iv) On each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall pay to
GMAC, as the holder of the Retained Property, any Interest
Collections for the related Collection Period that do not
constitute Trust Interest Collections (calculated after the
adjustment, if any, described in subsection (v) below) to the
extent not previously so paid to GMAC.

(v) If the Servicer does not make a Servicer Advance in
the amount of the full Deficiency Amount for a Distribution
Date, the Servicer shall calculate for each Account in the
Pool of Accounts in which the full amount of interest due for
the related Collection Period was not collected, the product
of (i) the amount of interest collected with respect to such
Collection Period and (ii) the difference between (A) the
percentage equivalent (which shall never exceed 100%) of a
fraction, the numerator of which is the average daily
aggregate principal balance of the Eligible Receivables in
such Account during the related Collection Period and the
denominator of which is the average daily aggregate principal
balance of all Receivables (including Receivables included in
the Retained Property) in such Account during the related
Collection Period and (B) the Trust Percentage for such
Distribution Date. With respect to each such Account, the
absolute amount of such amount so calculated shall be
(1) added to Trust Interest Collections for such Distribution
Date to the extent such amount is greater than zero or
(2) subtracted from Trust Interest Collections for such
Distribution Date to the extent such amount is less than zero. 
No adjustment to Trust Interest Collections shall be made with
respect to the other Accounts in the Pool of Accounts.

<PAGE>25

(d) The Indenture Trustee (based on the information
contained in the Servicer's Accounting delivered on any such
date or the related Determination Date pursuant to Section
3.05 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as applicable)
shall apply Available Trust Principal in the following amounts
and in the following priority:

(i) Except as otherwise required pursuant to the terms
of any series of Revolving Notes or, during the Payment
Period, if any, for any series of Term Notes, pursuant to the
terms of such Term Notes (including pursuant to any related
supplement hereto), on each date during the Revolving Period,
all Trust Principal Collections and Additional Trust
Principal, together with the Cash Collateral Amount (including
any portion thereof on deposit in the Collection Account) and
the proceeds from any issuances of Securities and additional
borrowings under any Revolving Notes, shall be available for
the purchase of additional Receivables from the Seller on such
date pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof and shall be paid to
the Seller on account thereof by the Indenture Trustee;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that amounts shall be held as the Cash
Collateral Amount to the extent required to ensure that the
Daily Trust Balance equals the Daily Trust Invested Amount for
such date. Any amounts described in the preceding sentence as
being available for the purchase of additional Receivables not
required to be set aside for any series of Revolving Notes or
any series of Term Notes during its Payment Period pursuant to
the terms of such Notes shall be available for the purchase of
additional Receivables from the Seller on such date pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) as described in the preceding sentence. The
determinations under this Section 4.5(d)(i) shall be made
after giving effect to any payments of principal on, or
additional borrowings under, the Revolving Notes, all
acquisitions by the Trust of Receivables and all issuances of
Securities by the Trust on such date. The Cash Collateral
Amount shall be maintained on deposit in the Collection
Account to the extent required by Section 6.2.

(ii) On each Distribution Date for the Revolving Period
on which a principal payment is required to be made on (or set
aside for) any series of Revolving Notes and on each
Distribution Date related to the Payment Period, if any, for
a series of Term Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall apply
Available Trust Principal and make payments of principal on
such Notes (or set aside amounts for such purpose in the Note
Distribution Account or the Revolver Distribution Account, as
applicable) as provided in the terms of such Notes (including
any related supplement hereto or to the Indenture).

(iii) On each Distribution Date related to the Wind Down
Period, the Indenture Trustee shall apply Available Trust 

- 21 -

<PAGE>26

Principal in the following amounts and in the following
priority:
(A) to the Note Distribution Account, an amount
equal to the Aggregate Noteholders' Principal;

(B) to the Revolver Distribution Account, an amount
equal to the Required Revolver Payment; and

(C) to the Certificate Distribution Account, an
amount equal to the Aggregate Certificateholders'
Principal.

On each Distribution Date related to an Early
Amortization Period, the Indenture Trustee shall apply
Available Trust Principal in the following amounts and in the
following priority:

(A) to the Note Distribution Account, an amount
equal to the Aggregate Noteholders' Principal and to
the Revolver Distribution Account, an amount equal to
the Required Revolver Payment; and

(B) to the Certificate Distribution Account, an
amount equal to the Aggregate Certificateholders'
Principal.

(e) On each Distribution Date for the Wind Down Period or an
Early Amortization Period, the Seller shall (or shall use
reasonable efforts to cause GMAC on its behalf to) deposit in the
Collection Account an amount equal to the Supplemental Principal
Allocation for such Distribution Date. The Seller shall be
entitled to reimbursement of the aggregate amount of Supplemental
Principal Allocations for all Distribution Dates following the
payment in full of all Securities. The Trust's obligation to so
reimburse the Seller shall be limited to collections on Receivables
(as and when such amounts are received) and amounts on deposit in
the Reserve Fund.

(f) To the extent unreimbursed Trust Charge-Offs for any
Distribution Date exceed the Certificate Balance (calculated
without reduction for Trust Charge-Offs), such excess shall be
applied to reduce the Outstanding Amount attributable to each
series of Notes, pro rata on the basis of the Outstanding Amount
attributable to each such series (calculated without reduction for
Trust Charge-Offs after giving effect to any amounts to be paid on
such Distribution Date).

SECTION 4.6 RESERVE FUND.

(a) The Reserve Fund shall include the money and other
property deposited and held therein pursuant to this Section 4.6
and Section 4.5. On the Initial Closing Date, the Seller shall
deposit the Reserve Fund Initial Deposit into the Reserve Fund. 
The Seller may make additional deposits into the Reserve Fund from
time to time in connection with the issuance of Additional
Securities or an increase in the Specified Maximum Revolver Balance
(at which time the formula for the Reserve Fund Required Amount may
be adjusted). In addition, the Seller, in its sole discretion, may
at any time make an additional deposit into the Reserve Fund in an
amount up to 1% of the Maximum Pool Balance as of the date such
additional deposit is to be made. The Reserve Fund shall not under
any circumstances be deemed to be part of or otherwise included in
the Trust.

(b) If the amount on deposit in the Reserve Fund on any
Distribution Date (after giving effect to all deposits therein or
withdrawals therefrom on such Distribution Date) exceeds the
Reserve Fund Required Amount for such Distribution Date, the
Servicer shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to distribute an
amount equal to any such excess to the Seller, unless otherwise
agreed to by the Seller.

(c) In order to provide for timely payments in
accordance with Section 4.5 and the terms of any Securities, to
assure availability of the amounts maintained in the Reserve Fund
for the benefit of the Securityholders and the Servicer, and as
security for the performance by the Seller of its obligations
hereunder, the Seller on behalf of itself and its successors and
assigns, hereby pledges to the Indenture Trustee and its successors
and assigns, all its right, title and interest in and to (i) the
Reserve Fund and all proceeds of the foregoing, including, without
limitation, all other amounts and investments held from time to
time in the Reserve Fund (whether in the form of deposit accounts,
Physical Property, book-entry securities, uncertificated securities
or otherwise) and (ii) the Reserve Fund Initial Deposit and all
proceeds thereon ((i) and (ii), collectively, the "RESERVE FUND
PROPERTY"), to have and to hold all the aforesaid property, rights
and privileges unto the Indenture Trustee, its successors and
assigns, in trust for the uses and purposes, and subject to the
terms and provisions, set forth in this Section 4.6. The Indenture
Trustee hereby acknowledges such transfer and accepts the trust

interests and perform all such other acts as may be necessary
in order to perfect or to maintain the perfection of the

the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee shall not be required
to make any distributions, deposits or other remittances in respect
of any Notes or to the related Distribution Account pursuant to

made by virtue of the preceding sentence shall nonetheless be
accounted for as having been distributed, deposited or remitted for
purposes of determining other amounts required to be distributed,
deposited or otherwise remitted on such Exempt Deposit Date or the
next succeeding Payment Date. On the Payment Date next succeeding
any Exempt Deposit Date on which any of the Servicer, the Seller,
the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee did not make

such longer period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to
which each Rating Agency shall consent), with the Indenture
Trustee's assistance as necessary, cause the Designated
Accounts (A) to be moved to a bank or trust company, the

subject to the exclusive custody and control of the
Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee shall have
sole signature authority with respect thereto;

(B) any Designated Account Property that
constitutes Physical Property shall be delivered to the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with paragraph (i) of the

security; and

(E) the Indenture Trustee shall maintain each item
of Designated Account Property in the particular
Designated Account to which such item originated and
shall not commingle items from different Designated
Accounts.

(iii) The Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the
Indenture Trustee (or by the Owner Trustee with the consent of
the Indenture Trustee) to instruct the Indenture Trustee to
make withdrawals and payments from the Designated Accounts for
the purpose of permitting the Servicer or the Owner Trustee to
carry out its respective duties hereunder or permitting the
Indenture Trustee to carry out its duties under the Indenture.

(c) Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Owner Trustee
shall possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account
and in all proceeds thereof (except Investment Proceeds). Except as
otherwise provided herein or in the Trust Agreement, the
Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion
and control of the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. All amounts in the Certificate Distribution
Account shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules
and regulations, be invested, at the written direction of the
Servicer, by the bank or trust company at which the Certificate
Distribution Account is maintained in Eligible Investments. Such
written direction shall constitute certification by the Servicer
that any such investment is authorized by this Section 6.1(c). 
Investments in Eligible Investments shall be made in the name of
the Owner Trustee or its nominee. If, at any time, the Certificate
Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the
Servicer shall within 10 Business Days (or such longer period, not
to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which each Rating Agency may 
consent) establish a new Certificate Distribution Account as an
Eligible Deposit Account and shall cause the Owner Trustee to
transfer any cash and/or any investments in the old Certificate
Distribution Account to such new Certificate Distribution Account.

(d) The Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and each
other Eligible Deposit Institution with whom a Designated Account
or the Certificate Distribution Account is maintained hereby waives
any right of set-off, counterclaim, security interest or bankers'
lien to which it might otherwise be entitled.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.2(b), the
Servicer shall deposit Collections into the Collection Account as
promptly as possible after the date such Collections are processed
by the Servicer, but in no event later than the second Business Day
after such processing date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, for so long as (i) GMAC is the Servicer, (ii) no
Servicing Default has occurred and is continuing and (iii) (A) GMAC
maintains a short-term rating of at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's
and P-1 by Moody's, (B) GMAC arranges for and maintains a letter of
credit or other form of Specified Support Arrangement in respect of
the Servicer's obligations to make deposits of Collections in the
Collection Account that is acceptable in form and substance to each
Rating Agency or (C) GMAC otherwise obtains the written confirma-
tion from each Rating Agency that the failure by GMAC to make daily
deposits shall not result in a downgrade, suspension or withdrawal
of the rating of any outstanding series or class of Securities with
respect to which it is a Rating Agency (each of clause (i), (ii)
and (iii), a "MONTHLY REMITTANCE CONDITION"), then, subject to any
limitations in the confirmations described in (C) above, if then
applicable, the Servicer need not deposit Trust Principal
Collections and Trust Interest Collections into the Collection
Account on a daily basis, but may make a single deposit into the
Collection Account in same-day or next-day funds not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day immediately
preceding a Distribution Date (or, with the consent of the
Indenture Trustee, in same-day funds not later than 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on a Distribution Date) in a net amount equal to
the amount which would have been on deposit in the Collection
Account on such Distribution Date with respect to the related
Collection Period; provided, that the amount of the Cash Collateral
Amount for the last day of any Collection Period shall be deposited
into the Collection Account (to the extent not already on deposit
therein) no later than the second Business Day of the following
Collection Period. If and so long as a Monthly Remittance
Condition ceases to be satisfied, the Servicer shall commence, if
not already doing so, making deposits in accordance with Section
6.2(a) no later than the first day of the first Collection Period
that begins at least two Business Days after the day on which such
Monthly Remittance Condition ceases to be satisfied.

(a) any failure by the Servicer to deliver to the
Indenture Trustee for deposit in any of the Designated Accounts or
to the Owner Trustee for deposit in the Certificate Distribution
Account any required payment or to direct the Indenture Trustee or
the Owner Trustee to make any required distribution therefrom,
which failure continues unremedied for a period of five Business
Days after written notice is received by the Servicer from the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee or after discovery of such
failure by an officer of the Servicer;

(b) any failure on the part of the Servicer duly to
observe or perform in any material respect any other covenant or
agreement of the Servicer set forth in this Agreement, the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust Agreement, 

- 36 -

<PAGE>41

which failure (i) materially and adversely affects the rights of
Securityholders and (ii) continues unremedied for a period of 90
days after the date on which written notice of such failure,
requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
Servicer by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, or to the
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee by
Noteholders whose Notes evidence not less than 25% of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes as of the close of the preceding
Distribution Date or by Certificateholders whose Certificates
evidence not less than 25% of the Voting Interests as of the close
of the preceding Distribution Date or after discovery of such
failure by an officer of the Servicer;

(c) any representation, warranty or certification made
by the Servicer in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement proves to have been incorrect when made
and such inaccuracy has a material adverse effect on the rights of
the Securityholders and such material adverse effect continues for
a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice thereof,
requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
Servicer by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee; or

(d) the entry of a decree or order by a court or agency
or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises for
the appointment of a conservator, receiver or liquidator for the
Servicer, in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of
assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding
up or liquidation of their respective affairs, and the continuance
of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of
90 consecutive days; or

(e) the consent by the Servicer to the appointment of a
conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency,
readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities, or
similar proceedings of or relating to the Seller or the Servicer or
of or relating to substantially all of their respective property;

debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take
advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of all or substantially
all of its obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no
Servicing Default where a Servicing Default would otherwise exist
due to a delay in or failure of performance under Section 8.1(a)
for a period of 10 Business Days, or under Section 8.1(b) or (c)
for a period of 60 days, if the delay or failure giving rise to
such Servicing Default was caused by an act of God or the public
enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public disorder,
rebellion or sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire,
hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or similar causes. The preceding 

- 37 -
<PAGE>42

sentence shall not relieve the Servicer from using its best efforts
to perform its obligations in a timely manner in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
and the Servicer shall provide the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee, the Seller and the Securityholders with prompt notice of
such failure or delay by it, together with a description of its
efforts so to perform its obligations. The Servicer shall
immediately notify the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee in
writing of any Servicing Default.

SECTION 8.2 CONSEQUENCES OF A SERVICING DEFAULT. If
a Servicing Default shall occur and be continuing, either the
Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders whose Notes evidence not less
than a majority of the Outstanding Amount attributable to such
Notes as of the close of the preceding Distribution Date (or, if
the Notes have been paid in full and the Indenture has been
discharged with respect thereto, by the Owner Trustee or
Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence not less than a
majority of the Voting Interests as of the close of the preceding
Distribution Date) by notice then given in writing to the Servicer
and the Owner Trustee (and to the Indenture Trustee if given by the
Noteholders or the Certificateholders) may terminate all, but not
less than all, of the rights and obligations (other than its
obligations that have accrued up to the time of such termination)
of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written
notice, all authority and power of the Servicer under this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, whether with
respect to the Notes, the Certificates, the Accounts in the Pool of
Accounts, the related Receivables (including those held by the
Trust and those retained by GMAC) or otherwise, shall pass to and
be vested in the Indenture Trustee pursuant to and under this
Section 8.2. The Indenture Trustee is hereby authorized and
empowered (upon the failure of the Servicer to cooperate) to
execute and deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact
or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to
do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate
to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to
complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivables arising
under the Accounts in the Pool of Accounts and related documents,
or otherwise. The Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the Servicer under this Agreement
and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including, without
limitation, the transfer to the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
Trustee for administration by it of all Collections that shall at
the time be held by the Servicer for deposit, or that shall have
been deposited by the Servicer in the Collection Account, the Note
Distribution Account, the Revolver Distribution Account or the
Certificate Distribution Account or thereafter received with
respect to the Receivables in the Accounts in the Pool of Accounts
that shall at that time be held by the Servicer. In addition to 

- 38 -
<PAGE>43

any other amounts that are then payable to the Servicer under this
Agreement, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive from the
successor Servicer, as described in Section 8.6, reimbursements for
any outstanding Servicer Advances made during the period prior to
the notice pursuant to this Section 8.2 which terminates the
obligation and rights of the Servicer under this Agreement. To the
extent that compliance with this Section 8.2 shall require the
Servicer to disclose to the successor Servicer information of any
kind which the Servicer reasonably deems to be confidential, the
successor Servicer shall be required to enter into such customary
licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Servicer shall deem
necessary to protect its interest.

SECTION 8.3 INDENTURE TRUSTEE TO ACT; APPOINTMENT OF
SUCCESSOR. 

(a) On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice
of termination pursuant to Section 8.2, the Indenture Trustee shall
be the successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as
servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for in this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and shall be
subject to all the responsibilities, restrictions, duties and
liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. As compensation therefor, the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the
Collection Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been
entitled to under this Agreement if no such notice of termination
had been given. Notwithstanding the above, the Indenture Trustee
may, if it is unwilling to so act, or shall, if it is legally
unable so to act, appoint, or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of, a successor (i) having a net
worth of not less than $100,000,000, (ii) a long-term unsecured
debt rating from Moody's of at least Baa3 (unless such requirement
is expressly waived by Moody's) and (iii) whose regular business
includes the servicing of dealer floor plan automotive receivables,
as the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement and the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement in the assumption of all or any
part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer
under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
(except that such successor shall not be liable for any liabilities
incurred by any predecessor Servicer). Any successor to the
Servicer shall automatically agree to be bound by the terms and
provisions of any Specified Support Arrangement. In connection
with such appointment and assumption, the Indenture Trustee may
make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out
of Collections as it and such successor shall agree; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that
permitted the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement. The Indenture Trustee and such successor
shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement and the 

- 39 -
<PAGE>44

Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as shall be necessary to
effectuate any such succession.

(b) All authority and power granted to any successor
Servicer under this Agreement shall automatically cease and
terminate upon termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 7.1 of
the Trust Agreement, and shall pass to and be vested in the Seller
and, without limitation, the Seller is hereby authorized and
empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the successor
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other
instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or things
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of
servicing rights. The successor Servicer agrees to cooperate with
the Seller in effecting the termination of the responsibilities and
rights of the successor Servicer under this Agreement and the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The successor Servicer shall
transfer to the Seller its electronic records relating to the
Accounts and the Receivables serviced hereunder in such electronic
form as the Seller may reasonably request and shall transfer to the
Seller all other records, correspondence and documents in the
manner and at such times as the Seller shall reasonably request. 
To the extent that compliance with this Section 8.3 shall require
the successor Servicer to disclose to the Seller information of any
kind which the successor Servicer deems to be confidential, the
Seller shall be required to enter into such customary licensing and
confidentiality agreements as the successor Servicer shall deem
necessary to protect its interests.

SECTION 8.4 NOTIFICATION TO SECURITYHOLDERS. Upon any
termination of, or appointment of a successor to, the Servicer
pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indenture Trustee shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Term Noteholders, the
Revolving Noteholders and the Rating Agencies and the Owner Trustee
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Certificateholders.

SECTION 8.5 WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. Noteholders
whose Notes evidence not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Amount of the Notes as of the close of the preceding Distribution
Date (or, if all of the Notes have been paid in full and the
Indenture has been discharged in accordance with its terms,
Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence not less than a
majority of the Voting Interests as of the close of the preceding
Distribution Date), voting as a single class, may, on behalf of all
Securityholders, waive any default by the Servicer in the
performance of its obligations hereunder and under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and its consequences, except a Servicing
Default under Section 8.1(a) of this Agreement. Upon any such
waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and
any Servicing Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have
been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 8.6 REPAYMENT OF ADVANCES. If the identity of
the Servicer shall change, the predecessor Servicer shall be
entitled to receive, to the extent of available funds,

SECTION 2.7 LIABILITY OF THE SELLER AND THE CERTIFI-
CATE OWNERS. 

(a) The Seller shall be liable directly to and shall
indemnify the injured party for all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses of the Trust (including expenses, to the
extent not paid out of the Owner Trust Estate) to the extent that
the Seller would be liable if the Trust were a partnership under
the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act in which the
Seller were a general partner; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Seller
shall not be liable for (i) any losses incurred by a Certificate-
holder or a Certificate Owner in its capacity as an investor in
the Certificates or by a Noteholder or Note Owner in its capacity
as an investor in the Notes or (ii) any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses arising out of the imposition by any
taxing authority of any federal income, state or local income or
franchise taxes, Michigan single business tax, or any other taxes
imposed on or measured by gross or net income, gross or net
receipts, capital, net worth and similar items (including any
interest, penalties or additions with respect thereto) upon the
Certificateholders, the Certificate Owners, the Noteholders, the
Note Owners, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee
(including any liabilities, costs or expenses with respect
thereto) with respect to any Receivables not specifically
indemnified or represented to hereunder. In addition, any third
party creditors of the Trust (other than in connection with the

3

<PAGE>8

obligations described in the preceding sentence for which the
Seller shall not be liable) shall be deemed third party
beneficiaries of this subsection 2.7(a). The obligations of the
Seller under this subsection 2.7(a) shall be evidenced by the
Certificates issued pursuant to Section 3.10, which for purposes
of the Business Trust Statute shall be deemed to be a separate
class of Certificates from all other Certificates issued by the
Trust; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the rights and obligations
evidenced by all Certificates, regardless of class, shall be
identical, except as provided in this subsection 2.7(a), Section
4.3, and in the definition of Voting Interests, except as to the
applicable Certificate Rate as contemplated by Section 3.3 and
except that Certificates may, but are not required to, be issued
in book-entry form.

(b) No Certificate Owner, other than to the extent set
forth in subsection 2.7(a) with respect to the Seller, shall have
any personal liability for any liability or obligation of the
Trust.

SECTION 2.8 TITLE TO TRUST PROPERTY. Legal title
to all the Owner Trust Estate shall be vested at all times in the
Trust as a separate legal entity except where applicable law in
any jurisdiction requires title to any part of the Owner Trust
Estate to be vested in a trustee or trustees, in which case title
shall be deemed to be vested in the Owner Trustee, a co-trustee
and/or a separate trustee, as the case may be.

SECTION 2.9 SITUS OF TRUST. The Trust shall be
located and administered in the State of Delaware. All bank
accounts maintained by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust
shall be located in the State of Delaware or the State of New
York. The Trust shall not have any employees in any state other
than Delaware; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall
restrict or prohibit the Owner Trustee from having employees
within or without the State of Delaware. Payments shall be
received by the Trust only in Delaware or New York, and payments
and distributions shall be made by the Trust only from Delaware
or New York. The only office of the Trust shall be the Corporate
Trust Office in Delaware.

SECTION 2.10 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
SELLER. The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Owner
Trustee that:

(a) The Seller has been duly organized and is validly
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware, with power and authority to own
its properties and to conduct its business as such

(b) The Seller is duly qualified to do business and,
where necessary is in good standing (or is exempt from such
requirement), and has obtained all necessary licenses and
approvals in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or
lease of property or the conduct of its business requires

or obtain licenses or approvals would not have a material
adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations
under the Basic Documents to which it is a party. 

(c) The Seller has the power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to carry out its terms and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein; and the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
have been duly authorized by the Seller by all necessary
corporate action.

(d) The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein by the
Seller and the fulfillment of the terms of this Agreement
by the Seller shall not conflict with, result in any breach
of any of the terms and provisions of or constitute (with
or without notice or lapse of time) a default under, the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Seller, or
any indenture, agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other
instrument to which the Seller is a party or by which it is
bound, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such
indenture, agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other
instrument (other than pursuant to the Basic Documents), or
violate any law or, to the best of the Seller's knowledge,
any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Seller of
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Seller or any of its properties.

SECTION 2.11 TAX TREATMENT. The Seller and the Owner
Trustee, by entering into this Agreement, and the Certificate-
holders and the Certificate Owners, by acquiring any Certificate
or interest therein, (i) express their intention that the
Certificates shall qualify under applicable tax law as
partnership interests in a partnership which holds the Trust
Estate for their benefit and (ii) unless otherwise required by
appropriate taxing authorities, agree to treat the Certificates
as partnership interests in such a partnership for the purposes
of federal income, state and local income and franchise taxes,
Michigan single business tax and any other taxes imposed upon,
measured by or based upon gross or net income.

those Certificates issued on the Initial Closing Date; PROVIDED,
however, that any class of Certificates may have a different
Certificate Rate than the Certificates of any other class and may
be issued in book-entry form pursuant to Section 3.11 hereof. 
The Certificate Rate for any such Certificates issued after the
Initial Closing Date shall be set forth in the related
Certificate Issuance Order. The terms of any Certificates as
provided in a Certificate Issuance Order shall be considered
terms of this Trust Agreement. Any Certificate Issuance Order
issued pursuant to this Section shall be considered a part of
this Agreement.

(c) No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any
benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose,
unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in EXHIBIT A,
executed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee's
authenticating agent, by manual signature. Such authentication
shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall
have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication. 
Citibank, N.A. is hereby appointed as the Owner Trustee's
authenticating agent.

SECTION 3.4 REGISTRATION; REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER
AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

(a) The Certificate Registrar shall keep or cause to
be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section
3.8, a Certificate Register in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Owner Trustee shall provide
for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and
exchanges of Certificates as provided herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that no Certificate may be subdivided upon transfer or exchange
in a manner such that the resulting Certificate if it had been
sold in the original offering would have had an initial offering
price of less than $250,000. Citibank, N.A. shall be the initial
Certificate Registrar. Upon any resignation of a Certificate
Registrar, the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint a successor
or, if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume the
duties of Certificate Registrar.

<PAGE>12

(b) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any
Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to
Section 3.8, the Owner Trustee shall execute on behalf of the
Trust, authenticate and deliver (or shall cause Citibank, N.A.,
as its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver), in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new
Certificates of the same class in authorized denominations of a
like aggregate amount dated the date of authentication by the
Owner Trustee or any authenticating agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Seller shall have advised the Owner Trustee in
writing that an Undertaking Letter shall be required with respect
to any transfer, such transfer shall not be effective unless the
requirements of Section 9.12, with respect to the delivery of an
Undertaking Letter, shall have been complied with.

(c) At the option of a Holder, Certificates may be
exchanged for other Certificates of the same class in authorized
denominations of a like amount upon surrender of the Certificates
to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office maintained pursuant
to Section 3.8. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for
exchange, the Owner Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust,
authenticate and deliver (or shall cause Citibank, N.A., as its
authenticating agent, to authenticate and deliver) one or more
Certificates dated the date of authentication by the Owner
Trustee or any authenticating agent. Such Certificates shall be
delivered to the Holder making the exchange.

(d) Every Certificate presented or surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Owner
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder
or his attorney duly authorized in writing and such other
documents and instruments as may be required by Section 9.12. 
Each Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be cancelled and subsequently destroyed by the
Owner Trustee or Certificate Registrar in accordance with its
customary practice. The Owner Trustee shall certify to the Seller
that surrendered Certificates have been duly cancelled and
retained or destroyed, as the case may be.

(e) No service charge shall be made for any registra-
tion of transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Owner
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of
Certificates.

SECTION 3.5 MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN
CERTIFICATES.

(a) If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered
to the Certificate Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar
receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Certificate and (ii) there is delivered to the
Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee and the Trust such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of
them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Certificate

8

<PAGE>13

Registrar or the Owner Trustee that such Certificate has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall
execute on behalf of the Trust and the Owner Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver (or shall cause Citibank, N.A., as its
authenticating agent, to authenticate and deliver), in exchange
for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificate, a replacement Certificate of the same class in
authorized denominations of a like amount; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, but not
a mutilated Certificate, shall have become or within seven days
shall be due and payable, then instead of issuing a replacement
Certificate the Owner Trustee may pay such destroyed, lost or
stolen Certificate when so due or payable.

(b) If, after the delivery of a replacement
Certificate or distribution in respect of a destroyed, lost or
stolen Certificate pursuant to subsection 3.5(a), a bona fide
purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which such
replacement Certificate was issued presents for payment such
original Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
recover such replacement Certificate (or such distribution) from
the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Certificate from such Person to whom such replacement
Certificate was delivered or any assignee of such Person, except
a bona fide purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the
security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any
loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Owner Trustee in
connection therewith.

(c) In connection with the issuance of any replacement
Certificate under this Section 3.5, the Owner Trustee may require
the payment by the Holder of such Certificate of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Owner Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar) connected therewith.

(d) Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this
Section 3.5 in replacement of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional
beneficial interest in the Trust, whether or not the mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall be found at any time
or be enforced by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any
and all other Certificates duly issued hereunder.

(e) The provisions of this Section 3.5 are exclusive
and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and
remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates.

SECTION 3.6 PERSONS DEEMED CERTIFICATEHOLDERS. 
Prior to due presentation of a Certificate for registration of
transfer, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may
treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be
registered in the Certificate Register as the Certificateholder
of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions
pursuant to Article V and for all other purposes whatsoever, and
neither the Owner Trustee nor the Certificate Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.

SECTION 3.7 ACCESS TO LIST OF CERTIFICATEHOLDERS'
NAMES AND ADDRESSES. The Owner Trustee shall furnish or cause to
be furnished to the Servicer and the Seller, within 15 days after
receipt by the Owner Trustee of a request therefor from the
Servicer or the Seller in writing, a list, in such form as the
Servicer or the Seller may reasonably require, of the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record
Date. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, shall
be deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the Servicer, the
Seller or the Owner Trustee accountable by reason of the
disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from
which such information was derived.

SECTION 3.8 MAINTENANCE OF CORPORATE TRUST OFFICE. 
The Owner Trustee shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, the
City of New York, an office or offices or agency or agencies
where Certificates may be surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the
Owner Trustee in respect of the Certificates and the Basic
Documents may be served. The Owner Trustee initially designates
the offices of Citibank, N.A., as its principal office for such
purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt written notice to
the Seller and to the Certificateholders of any change in the
location of the Certificate Register or any such office or
agency.

SECTION 3.9 APPOINTMENT OF PAYING AGENT. The Paying
Agent shall make distributions to Certificateholders from the
Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.2 and
shall report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner
Trustee and the Servicer. Any Paying Agent shall have the
revocable power to withdraw funds from the Certificate
Distribution Account for the purpose of making the distributions
referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such power and
remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines in its
sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be Citibank, N.A. 
Citibank, N.A. shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon
30 days' written notice to the Owner Trustee. If Citibank, N.A.
shall no longer be the Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall
appoint a successor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank
or trust company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor
Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the
Owner Trustee to execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an
instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional
Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee that as Paying
Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent
shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for distribution to the

10

<PAGE>15

Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the Certificate-
holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such
Certificateholders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed
funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent
such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession
to the Owner Trustee. The provisions of Sections 6.3, 6.6, 6.7
and 6.9 shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role as
Paying Agent, for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as
Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying
agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to
the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the
context requires otherwise.

SECTION 3.10 DISPOSITION BY SELLER. On and after the
Initial Closing Date, the Seller shall retain beneficial and
record ownership of Certificates representing at least 1% of the
Certificate Balance of each class of Certificates. Any attempted
transfer of any Certificate that would reduce such interest of
the Seller below 1% of the Certificate Balance shall be void. 
The Owner Trustee shall cause any Certificate issued to the
Seller to contain a legend to such effect. Certificates issued
to the Seller shall be in definitive form only.

SECTION 3.11 BOOK-ENTRY CERTIFICATES. The
Certificates to be issued on the Initial Closing Date (other than
those described in Section 3.10 and those to be issued to
Institutional Accredited Investors (as defined in Exhibit E))
shall be issued as Book-Entry Certificates and shall be subject
to a Certificate Depository Agreement substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit B hereto. Such Certificates shall be
delivered to The Depository Trust Company, the initial Clearing
Agency by or on behalf of the Trust and shall initially be
registered on the Certificate Register in the name of Cede & Co.,
the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency, and no such
Certificate Owner shall receive a Definitive Certificate. If,
and to the extent, so provided in the related Certificate
Issuance Order, Certificates to be issued after the Initial
Closing Date (other than those described in Section 3.10) may be
issued in the form of a typewritten certificate or certificates
representing Book-Entry Certificates. Any such Book-Entry
Certificate shall be delivered to the Clearing Agency by or on
behalf of the Trust and shall be registered on the Certificate
Register in the name of the Clearing Agency (or its nominee) and
no Certificate Owner shall receive a Definitive Certificate. If
and to the extent Book-Entry Certificates have been issued
pursuant to this Section 3.11 with respect to any Certificates:

(a) the provisions of this Section 3.11 shall be in
full force and effect;

(b) the Certificate Registrar and the Owner Trustee
shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all
purposes of this Agreement (including the distribution of
Certificate Balance and interest on such Certificates and
the giving of instructions or directions hereunder) as the
sole Holder of such Certificates, and shall have no
obligation to the Certificate Owners;

11

<PAGE>16
(c) to the extent that the provisions of this Section
3.11 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement,
the provisions of this Section 3.11 shall control;

(d) the rights of the Certificate Owners shall be
exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be
limited to those established by law and agreements between
such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the
Clearing Agency Participants and, unless and until
Definitive Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 3.13,
the initial Clearing Agency shall make book-entry transfers
among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and
transmit distributions of Certificate Balance and interest
on such Certificates to such Clearing Agency Participants;
and

(e) whenever this Agreement requires or permits
actions to be taken based upon instructions or directions
of Holders of Certificates evidencing a specified percentage
of the Voting Interests, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed
to represent such percentage only to the extent that it has
received written instructions to such effect from
Certificate Owners and/or Clearing Agency Participants
owning or representing, respectively, such required
percentage of Voting Interests and has delivered such
instructions to the Owner Trustee.

The Seller or the Owner Trustee may set a record date for the
purpose of determining the identity of Holders of Certificates
entitled to vote or to consent to any action by vote as provided
in this Agreement.

SECTION 3.12 NOTICES TO CLEARING AGENCY. With
respect to any Certificates issued as Book-Entry Certificates,
whenever a notice or other communication to the
Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates representing such Certificates
shall have been issued to the related Certificate Owners pursuant
to Section 3.13, the Owner Trustee shall give all such notices
and communications specified herein to be given to the related
Certificateholders to the Clearing Agency and shall have no
further obligation to such Certificate Owners.

SECTION 3.13 TERMINATION OF BOOK-ENTRY REGISTRATION. 
With respect to any Certificates issued as Book-Entry
Certificates, if (i) the Administrator advises the Owner Trustee
in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able
to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the
Certificates, and the Administrator is unable to locate a
qualified successor, (ii) the Administrator at its option advises
the Owner Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the
book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or (iii) after the
occurrence of an Event of Default or a Servicing Default,
Certificate Owners representing beneficial interests aggregating
at least a majority of the Voting Interests advise the Clearing
Agency in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system
through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interest of
the Certificate Owners, then the Clearing Agency shall notify all
Certificate Owners and the Owner Trustee of the occurrence of any
such event and of the availability of Definitive Certificates to
Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the
12

<PAGE>17

Owner Trustee of the typewritten Certificate or Certificates
representing Book-Entry Certificates by the Clearing Agency,
accompanied by registration instructions, the Owner Trustee shall
execute and authenticate the related Definitive Certificates in
accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. Neither
the Certificate Registrar nor the Owner Trustee shall be liable
for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may
conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such
instructions. Additionally, Definitive Certificates shall be
issued to a Certificate Owner (or its nominee) at any time
(subject to the rules and procedures of the Clearing Agency) upon
the request of such Certificate Owner that its interest be
exchanged for a Definitive Certificate or Certificates. Upon the
issuance of such Definitive Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall
recognize the Holders of such Definitive Certificates as
Certificateholders.

SECTION 3.14 SELLER AS CERTIFICATEHOLDER. The Seller
in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or
pledgee of Certificates and may otherwise deal with the Owner
Trustee or its Affiliates as if it were not the Seller.

to the Trust without the unanimous prior approval of all Holders
of Certificates (including the Seller) and the delivery to the
Owner Trustee by each such Certificateholder of a certificate
certifying that such Certificateholder reasonably believes that
the Trust is insolvent. By its acceptance of any Certificate
issued pursuant to Section 3.10, the Seller agrees that it, as
the holder thereof, shall not approve or be deemed to have
approved the commencement of a voluntary proceeding in bankruptcy

14<PAGE>
<PAGE>19

SECTION 4.4 RESTRICTIONS ON CERTIFICATEHOLDERS'
POWER. The Certificateholders shall not direct the Owner Trustee
to take or refrain from taking any action if such action or

ARTICLE V
APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS; CERTAIN DUTIES

SECTION 5.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF CERTIFICATE
DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT.

(a) The Servicer, for the benefit of the Certificate-
holders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the Owner
Trustee an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Superior
Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I Certificate Distribution
Account (the "CERTIFICATE DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT"), bearing an
additional designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the
Certificateholders.

(b) The Owner Trustee shall possess all right, title
and interest in and to all funds on deposit from time to time in
the Certificate Distribution Account and in all proceeds thereof
(except Investment Proceeds therefrom as set forth in the Trust
Sale and Servicing Agreement) for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. Except as otherwise provided herein or in
the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate
Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders. 
If, at any time, the Certificate Distribution Account ceases to
be an Eligible Deposit Account, the Owner Trustee (or the
Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if the Certificate
Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner Trustee or an
Affiliate thereof) shall within 10 Business Days (or such longer
period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which each Rating
Agency may consent) establish a new Certificate Distribution
Account as an Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any
cash and/or any investments to such new Certificate Distribution
Account.

15<PAGE>
<PAGE>20

SECTION 5.2 APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS.

(a) On each Distribution Date, the Owner Trustee shall
distribute to the Certificateholders the amounts deposited in the
Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to Section 4.5 of the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement with respect to such
Distribution Date (i) to the extent of the amount deposited with
respect to Aggregate Certificateholders' Interest, pro rata based
upon the amount of interest due with respect to each Certificate
and (ii) to the extent of any amount deposited with respect to
Aggregate Certificateholder's Principal, on a pro rata basis.

(b) On each Distribution Date, the Owner Trustee shall
send to each Certificateholder the statement provided to the
Owner Trustee by the Servicer pursuant to Section 4.8 of the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement on such Distribution Date
setting forth, among other things, the amount of the distribution
allocable to Certificate Balance and to interest, the Certificate
Balance after giving effect to such distribution, the balance of
the Reserve Fund (and amounts, if any, distributed from the
Reserve Fund), and the Monthly Servicing Fee with respect to the
Distribution Date or the related Collection Period, as
applicable, each since the last statement so provided to
Certificateholders.

(c) If any withholding tax is imposed on the Trust's
distribution (or allocations of income) to a Certificateholder,
such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the
Certificateholder in accordance with this Section 5.2. The Owner
Trustee is hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts
otherwise distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient
funds for the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the
Trust (but such authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee
from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and
withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the
outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax
imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as
cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is
withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to
a non-U.S. Certificateholder), the Owner Trustee may in its sole
discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with this Section
5.2(c). If a Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of
any such withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably
cooperate with such Certificateholder in making such claim so
long as such Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner
Trustee for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

(d) If the Indenture Trustee holds escheated funds for
payment to the Trust pursuant to Section 3.3(e) of the Indenture,
the Owner Trustee shall, upon notice from the Indenture Trustee
that such funds exist, submit on behalf of the Trust an Issuer
Order to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 3.3(e) of the
Indenture instructing the Indenture Trustee to pay such funds to
or at the order of the Seller.

16<PAGE>
<PAGE>21

SECTION 5.3 METHOD OF PAYMENT. Subject to Section
7.1(c) and subject to the right of the Owner Trustee and the
Clearing Agency to agree otherwise in the case of Book-Entry
Certificates, distributions required to be made to
Certificateholders on any Distribution Date shall be made to each
Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date either by
wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account of
such Holder at a bank or other entity having appropriate
facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall have
provided to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written
instructions at least five Business Days prior to such Record
Date, or, if not, by check mailed to such Certificateholder at
the address of such Holder appearing in the Certificate Register.

SECTION 5.4 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS TO THE
CERTIFICATEHOLDERS, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHERS. The
Owner Trustee shall (a) maintain (or cause to be maintained) the
books of the Trust on a calendar year basis on the accrual method
of accounting, (b) deliver to each Certificateholder, as may be
required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations or
otherwise, such information as may be required to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal income tax return, (c)
file such tax returns relating to the Trust and make such
elections as may from time to time be required or appropriate
under any applicable state or federal statute or rule or
regulation thereunder so as to maintain the Trust's
characterization as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, (d) cause such tax returns to be signed in the manner
required by law and (e) collect or cause to be collected any
withholding tax as described in and in accordance with subsection
5.2(c) with respect to income or distributions to
Certificateholders. In preparing and filing tax returns for the
Trust, the Owner Trustee shall allocate taxable income of the
Trust for each Collection Period in the following manner: (A) to
the Certificateholders, an amount equal to the sum of (1)
interest distributable on the Certificates on the Distribution
Date related to such Collection Period and (2) any Trust income
attributable to discount on the Receivables that corresponds to
any excess of the Certificate Balance of the Certificates over
their initial issue price; and (B) to the Seller, if and to the
extent that the taxable income of the Trust for such Collection
Period exceeds the amount computed under (A) above. Unless
otherwise permitted or required by any applicable law or
regulation, the Owner Trustee shall allocate amounts of taxable
income of the Trust for a particular Collection Period among the
Certificateholders in proportion to the Certificate Balance owned
by them as of the Record Date for the related Distribution Date.

17<PAGE>
<PAGE>22

SECTION 5.5 SIGNATURE ON RETURNS; TAX MATTERS
PARTNER. The Owner Trustee shall sign on behalf of the Trust any
and all tax returns of the Trust, unless applicable law requires
a Certificateholder to sign such documents, in which case such
documents shall be signed by the Seller. The Seller shall be the
"tax matters partner" of the Trust pursuant to the Code.

Trustee is authorized, but shall not be obligated, to take all
actions required of the Trust pursuant to the Basic Documents. 
The Owner Trustee is further authorized from time to time to take
such action as the Administrator recommends with respect to the
Basic Documents.

SECTION 6.3 ACCEPTANCE OF TRUSTS AND DUTIES. Except

hereunder and not in its individual capacity and all Persons
having any claim against the Owner Trustee by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Basic Document

hereby created and agrees to perform its duties hereunder with
respect to such trusts but only upon the terms of this Agreement. 
The Owner Trustee also agrees to disburse all monies actually
received by it constituting part of the Owner Trust Estate upon
the terms of the Basic Documents and this Agreement. The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable or accountable hereunder or under any
Basic Document under any circumstances, except (i) for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own
wilful misconduct or (ii) in the case of the inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 6.6 and expressly
made by the Owner Trustee. In particular, but not by way of
limitation (and subject to the exceptions set forth in the
preceding sentence):

or its ability to generate the distributions and payments
to be made to Certificateholders under this Agreement or to
Noteholders under the Indenture, including, without
limitation: the existence and contents of any such Receiv-
able on any computer or other record thereof; the validity

Document or in any related document or the accuracy of any
such warranty or representation or any action of the
Administrator, the Trustee or the Servicer or any
subservicer taken in the name of the Owner Trustee;

(b) the Owner Trustee shall not be liable with respect
to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in

Certificateholder;

funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability
is not reasonably assured or provided to it;

(d) under no circumstances shall the Owner Trustee be
liable for indebtedness evidenced by or arising under any
of the Basic Documents, including the principal of and
interest on the Notes or the Certificate Balance of and
interest on the Certificates;

(e) the Owner Trustee shall not be responsible for or
in respect of and makes no representation as to the validity

(f) the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for the
default or misconduct of the Administrator, the Indenture
Trustee, the Seller or the Servicer under any of the Basic
Documents or otherwise and the Owner Trustee shall have no
obligation or liability to perform the obligations of the
Trust under this Agreement or the Basic Documents that are
required to be performed by the Administrator under the
Administration Agreement, the Indenture Trustee under the
Indenture or the Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement or the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement; and

(g) the Owner Trustee shall be under no obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this
Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any litigation

direction of any of the Certificateholders, unless such
Certificateholders have offered to the Owner Trustee
security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by the Owner
Trustee therein or thereby. The right of the Owner Trustee
to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this
Agreement or in any Basic Document shall not be construed

performance of any such act.

SECTION 6.4 ACTION UPON INSTRUCTION BY CERTIFICATE-
HOLDERS.

by written instruction direct the Owner Trustee in the management
of the Trust. Such direction may be exercised at any time by
written instruction of the Certificateholders pursuant to Section
4.5.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee
shall not be required to take any action hereunder or under any
Basic Document if the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably
determined, or shall have been advised by counsel, that such
action is likely to result in liability on the part of the Owner
Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of any Basic
Document or is otherwise contrary to law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is unable to decide
between alternative courses of action permitted or required by
the terms of this Agreement or any Basic Document, or is unsure
as to the application, intent, interpretation or meaning of any
provision of this Agreement or the Basic Documents, the Owner
Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form as shall be
appropriate under the circumstances) to the Certificateholders
requesting instruction as to the course of action to be adopted,
and, to the extent the Owner Trustee acts in good faith in
accordance with any such instruction received, the Owner Trustee
shall not be liable on account of such action to any Person. If
the Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate
instructions within ten days of such notice (or within such
shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such
notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may, but
shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such

21

<PAGE>26

action which is consistent, in its view, with this Agreement or
the Basic Documents, and as it shall deem to be in the best
interests of the Certificateholders, and the Owner Trustee shall
have no liability to any Person for any such action or inaction.

SECTION 6.5 FURNISHING OF DOCUMENTS. The Owner
Trustee shall furnish (a) to the Certificateholders, promptly
upon receipt of a written request therefor, duplicates or copies
of all reports, notices, requests, demands, certificates,

Agreement.

SECTION 6.6 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF OWNER
TRUSTEE. The Owner Trustee hereby represents and warrants to the
Seller, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, that:

(a) It is a banking corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state
of its incorporation.

(b) It has full power, authority and legal right to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, and has taken all
necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and per-
formance by it of this Agreement. The eligibility requirements
set forth in Section 6.13 are satisfied with respect to it.

(c) The execution, delivery and performance by it of
this Agreement (i) shall not violate any provision of any law or
regulation governing the banking and trust powers of the Owner
Trustee or any order, writ, judgment or decree of any court,
arbitrator or governmental authority applicable to the Owner
Trustee or any of its assets, (ii) shall not violate any
provision of the corporate charter or by-laws of the Owner
Trustee or (iii) shall not violate any provision of, or
constitute, with or without notice or lapse of time, a default
under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien on any
properties included in the Trust pursuant to the provisions of
any mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement or other undertaking
to which it is a party, which violation, default or lien could
reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the
Owner Trustee's performance or ability to perform its duties as
Owner Trustee under this Agreement or on the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. 

(d) The execution, delivery and performance by the
Owner Trustee of this Agreement shall not require the
authorization, consent or approval of, the giving of notice to,
the filing or registration with, or the taking of any other
action in respect of, any Governmental Authority regulating the
banking and corporate trust activities of banks or trust
companies in the jurisdiction in which the Trust was formed.

22

<PAGE>27

(e) This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Owner Trustee and constitutes the legal, valid
and binding agreement of the Owner Trustee, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in
general and by general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law.

SECTION 6.7 RELIANCE; ADVICE OF COUNSEL.

(a) The Owner Trustee shall incur no liability to
anyone in acting upon any signature, instrument, notice,
resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report,
opinion, bond or other document or paper believed by it to be
genuine and believed by it to be signed by the proper party or
parties and need not investigate any fact or matter in any such
document. The Owner Trustee may accept a certified copy of a
resolution of the board of directors or other governing body of
any corporate party as conclusive evidence that such resolution
has been duly adopted by such body and that the same is in full
force and effect. As to any fact or matter the method of the
determination of which is not specifically prescribed herein, the
Owner Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a certificate,
signed by the president or any vice president or by the treasurer
or other authorized officers of the relevant party, as to such
fact or matter, and such certificate shall constitute full
protection to the Owner Trustee for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon.

(b) In the exercise or administration of the trusts
hereunder and in the performance of its duties and obligations
under this Agreement or the Basic Documents, the Owner Trustee: 
(i) may act directly or through its agents, attorneys, custodians
or nominees (including the granting of a power of attorney to
officers of Citibank, N.A. to execute and deliver any Basic
Documents, Certificate, Note or other documents related thereto
on behalf of the Owner Trustee) pursuant to agreements entered
into with any of them, and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable
for the conduct or misconduct of such agents, attorneys,
custodians or nominees if such agents, attorneys, custodians or
nominees shall have been selected by the Owner Trustee with
reasonable care; and (ii) may consult with counsel, accountants
and other skilled professionals to be selected with reasonable
care and employed by it. The Owner Trustee shall not be liable
for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in
accordance with the opinion or advice of any such counsel,
accountants or other such Persons and not contrary to this
Agreement or any Basic Document.

23

<PAGE>28
SECTION 6.8 OWNER TRUSTEE MAY OWN CERTIFICATES AND
NOTES. The Owner Trustee in its individual or any other capacity
may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates or Notes and may
deal with the Seller, the Administrator, the Indenture Trustee
and the Servicer in transactions in the same manner as it would
have if it were not the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 6.9 COMPENSATION AND INDEMNITY. The Owner
Trustee shall receive as compensation for its services hereunder
such fees as have been separately agreed upon before the date
hereof between the Seller and the Owner Trustee, and the Owner
Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Servicer for
its other reasonable expenses hereunder, including the reasonable
compensation, expenses and disbursements of such agents,
custodians, nominees, representatives, experts and counsel as the
Owner Trustee may employ in connection with the exercise and
performance of its rights and its duties hereunder. The Servicer
shall indemnify the Owner Trustee and its successors, assigns,
agents and servants in accordance with the provisions of Section
7.1 of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement. The indemnities
contained in this Section 6.9 shall survive the resignation or
termination of the Owner Trustee or the termination of this
Agreement. Any amounts paid to the Owner Trustee pursuant to
this Article VI shall be deemed not to be a part of the Owner
Trust Estate immediately after such payment.

SECTION 6.10 REPLACEMENT OF OWNER TRUSTEE.

(a) The Owner Trustee may at any time give notice of
its intent to resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby
created by giving written notice thereof to the Administrator;
PROVIDED that no such resignation shall become effective, and the
Owner Trustee shall not resign, prior to the time set forth in
Section 6.10(c). The Administrator may appoint a successor Owner
Trustee by delivering written instrument, in duplicate, to the
resigning Owner Trustee and the successor Owner Trustee. If no
successor Owner Trustee shall have been appointed and have
accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of such
notice, the resigning Owner Trustee giving such notice may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Owner Trustee. The Administrator shall remove the
Owner Trustee if:

(i) the Owner Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.13 and shall
fail to resign after written request therefor by the
Administrator;

(ii) the Owner Trustee shall be adjudged bankrupt or
insolvent; 

(iii) a receiver or other public officer shall be
appointed or take charge or control of the Owner Trustee or
of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; or

(iv) the Owner Trustee shall otherwise be incapable of
acting.

(b) If the Owner Trustee resigns or is removed or if
a vacancy exists in the office of Owner Trustee for any reason
24

<PAGE>29

the Administrator shall promptly appoint a successor Owner
Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate (one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the outgoing Owner Trustee so
removed and one copy to the successor Owner Trustee) and shall
pay all fees owed to the outgoing Owner Trustee.

(c) Any resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee
and appointment of a successor Owner Trustee pursuant to any of
the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall not become effective,
and no such resignation shall be deemed to have occurred, until
a written acceptance of appointment is delivered by the successor
Owner Trustee to the outgoing Owner Trustee and the
Administrator, and all fees and expenses due to the outgoing
Owner Trustee are paid. Any successor Owner Trustee appointed
pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be eligible to act in such
capacity in accordance with Section 6.13 and, following
compliance with the preceding sentence, shall become fully vested
with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor under this Agreement, with like effect as if
originally named as Owner Trustee. The Administrator shall
provide notice of such resignation or removal of the Owner
Trustee to each of the Rating Agencies.

(d) The predecessor Owner Trustee shall upon payment
of its fees and expenses deliver to the successor Owner Trustee
all documents and statements and monies held by it under this
Agreement. The Administrator and the predecessor Owner Trustee
shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other
things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly
vesting and confirming in the successor Owner Trustee all such
rights, powers, duties and obligations.

(e) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor
Owner Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.10, the Administrator
shall mail notice of the successor of such Owner Trustee to all
Certificateholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and
the Rating Agencies.

SECTION 6.11 MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF OWNER
TRUSTEE. Any Person into which the Owner Trustee may be merged
or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any
Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate
trust business of the Owner Trustee, shall be the successor of
the Owner Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be
eligible pursuant to Section 6.13, and without the execution or
filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any of
the parties hereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Owner Trustee
shall mail notice of such merger or consolidation to the Rating
Agencies.

SECTION 6.12 APPOINTMENT OF CO-TRUSTEE OR SEPARATE
TRUSTEE.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal
requirement of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Owner
Trust Estate or any of the Dealers may at the time be located,
the Administrator and the Owner Trustee acting jointly shall have

25

<PAGE>30
the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to
appoint one or more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee to act
as co-trustee, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or as separate
trustee or trustees, of all or any part of the Owner Trust
Estate, and to vest in such Person, in such capacity, such title
to the Trust, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other
provisions of this Section 6.12, such powers, duties, obliga-
tions, rights and trusts as the Administrator and the Owner
Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If the
Administrator shall not have joined in such appointment within 15
days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, the Owner
Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No
co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be
required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee
pursuant to Section 6.13 and no notice of the appointment of any
co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to
Section 6.10.

(b) Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the
following provisions and conditions:

(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations
conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee shall be
conferred upon and exercised or performed by the Owner
Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it
being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee
is not authorized to act separately without the Owner
Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that
under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular
act or acts are to be performed, the Owner Trustee shall be
incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in
which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations
(including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion
thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and
performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but
solely at the direction of the Owner Trustee;

(ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be
personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any
other trustee under this Agreement; and

(iii) the Administrator and the Owner Trustee acting
jointly may at any time accept the resignation of or remove
any separate trustee or co-trustee.

(c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the
Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the
then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if
given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate
trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the
conditions of this Article. Each separate trustee and co-
trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be
vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument
of appointment, either jointly with the Owner Trustee or
separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the
provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every
provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting
the liability of, or affording protection to, the Owner Trustee. 
Each such instrument shall be filed with the Owner Trustee and a
copy thereof given to the Administrator.
26

<PAGE>31

(d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time
appoint the Owner Trustee as its agent or attorney-in-fact with
full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to
do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its
behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all
of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall
vest in and be exercised by the Owner Trustee, to the extent
permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor
trustee.

SECTION 6.13 ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR OWNER
TRUSTEE. The Owner Trustee shall at all times satisfy the
requirements of Section 26(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act. 
The Owner Trustee shall at all times: (a) be a corporation
satisfying the provisions of Section 3807(a) of the Business
Trust Statute; (b) be authorized to exercise corporate trust
powers; (c) have an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of at least $50,000,000 and be subject to supervision or
examination by federal or state authorities; and (d) have (or
have a parent which has) a long-term unsecured debt rating of at
least BBB- by Standard & Poor's and at least Baa3 by Moody's. If
such corporation shall publish reports of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this
Section 6.13, the aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of such corporation shall be deemed to be its aggregate
capital, surplus and undivided profits as set forth in its most
recent report of condition so published. If at any time the
Owner Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 6.13, the Owner Trustee shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in
Section 6.10.

ARTICLE VII
TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT

SECTION 7.1 TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT.

(a) The Trust shall terminate on the date (the "Trust
Termination Date") on which the first of the following occurs: 
(i) if the Seller so elects, the day following the Distribution
Date on which all amounts required to be paid to the
Securityholders pursuant to the Basic Documents have been paid
(or deposited in the Note Distribution Account, the Certificate
Distribution Account or the Revolver Distribution Account) and
the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Notes is zero;
(ii) at the time provided in Section 7.2; and (iii) the Specified
Trust Termination Date. This Agreement and the obligations of
the parties hereunder (other than Section 6.9 hereof and as
otherwise expressly provided herein) shall terminate and be of no
further force or effect (i) if the Trust Termination Date is
determined pursuant to clause (i) above, on the Trust Termination
Date, (ii) if the Trust Termination Date is determined pursuant
to clause (ii) above, at the time provided in Section 7.2 and
(iii) if the Trust Termination Date is determined pursuant to
clause (iii) above, on the date following the Distribution Date
on which the final payments to be made to the Securityholders
pursuant to the Basic Documents have been paid (or deposited in
the appropriate Distribution Accounts).
27

<PAGE>32
(b) The bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, death
or incapacity of any Certificateholder, other than the Seller as
described in Section 7.2, shall not (x) operate to terminate this
Agreement or the Trust, nor (y) entitle such Certificateholder's
legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to take
any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding
up of all or any part of the Trust or the Owner Trust Estate nor
(z) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of
the parties hereto. Except as provided in Section 7.1(a), nei-
ther the Seller nor any Certificateholder shall be entitled to
revoke or terminate the Trust or this Agreement.

(c) Notice of any termination of the Trust, except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.2, specifying the Distribution
Date upon which the Certificateholders shall surrender their
Certificates to the Paying Agent for distribution of the final
distribution and cancellation, shall be given by the Owner
Trustee by letter to Certificateholders mailed within five
Business Days of receipt of notice of such termination from the
Servicer given pursuant to Section 9.4 of the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement, stating: (i) the Distribution Date upon or
with respect to which the final distribution of the Certificate
Balance of the Certificates shall be made upon presentation and
surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Paying Agent
therein designated; (ii) the amount of any such final
distribution of the Certificate Balance; and (iii) that the
Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not
applicable, distributions being made only upon presentation and
surrender of the Certificates at the office of the Paying Agent
therein specified. The Owner Trustee shall give such notice to
the Certificate Registrar (if other than the Owner Trustee) and
the Paying Agent at the time such notice is given to Certif-
icateholders. Upon presentation and surrender of the
Certificates, the Paying Agent shall cause to be distributed to
Certificateholders amounts distributable on such Distribution
Date pursuant to Section 5.2.

(d) If all of the Certificateholders shall not
surrender their Certificates for cancellation within six months
after the date specified in the written notice specified in
subsection 7.1(c), the Owner Trustee shall give a second written
notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their
Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution
with respect thereto. If within one year after the second notice
all the Certificates shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, the Owner Trustee may take appropriate steps, or
may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the
remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of their
Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds
and other assets that shall remain subject to this Agreement. 
Subject to applicable laws with respect to escheat of funds, any
funds remaining in the Trust after exhaustion of such remedies in
the preceding sentence shall be deemed property of the Seller and
distributed by the Owner Trustee to the Seller and the Owner
Trustee shall have no further liability to the Certificateholders
with respect thereto.

28

<PAGE>33

(e) Upon the winding up of the Trust and its termina-
tion, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificate of Trust to
be cancelled by filing a certificate of cancellation with the
Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of Section
3810 of the Business Trust Statute.

SECTION 7.2 TERMINATION UPON BANKRUPTCY OF THE
SELLER. Upon the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect
to the Seller, the Trust shall terminate, subject to the
liquidation, winding-up and dissolution procedures described
below, and provided that the rights and obligations of the
parties to this Agreement shall not terminate during such
liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. Promptly after the
occurrence of any Insolvency Event with respect to the Seller: 
(i) the Seller shall give the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee written notice of such Insolvency Event; (ii) the Owner
Trustee shall, upon the receipt of such written notice from the
Seller, give prompt written notice to the Certificateholders and
the Indenture Trustee of the occurrence of such event; and
(iii) the Indenture Trustee shall, upon receipt of written notice
of such Insolvency Event from the Owner Trustee or the Seller,
give prompt written notice to the Noteholders of the occurrence
of such event; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any failure to give a
notice required by this sentence shall not prevent or delay in
any manner a termination of the Trust pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 7.2. Ninety days after the date the
Seller gives the notice described in the preceding sentence,
unless the Owner Trustee shall have received written instructions
from each of the Certificateholders (other than the Seller and
any of its Affiliates) to the effect that each such party
disapproves of the liquidation of the assets held by the Trust
and the termination of the Trust and wishes to reconstitute the
Trust pursuant to terms corresponding to the terms of this
Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall direct the Indenture Trustee
promptly to sell, dispose or otherwise liquidate the assets of
the Trust (other than the Designated Accounts and the Certificate
Distribution Account) in a commercially reasonable manner and on
commercially reasonable terms (which may include continuing to
hold the Receivables and receiving collections thereon). The
proceeds of any such sale, disposition or liquidation shall be
treated as Collections on the Receivables in the Accounts in the
Pool of Accounts and deposited in the Collection Account pursuant
to Section 9.2 of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, and
thereupon this Agreement and the respective obligations and
responsibilities of the Seller, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee shall terminate (except as otherwise
expressly provided herein).

(and any other consents of Securityholders provided for in this
Agreement or in any other Basic Document) and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Securityholders shall
be subject to such reasonable requirements as the Owner Trustee

SECTION 9.10 HEADINGS. The headings herein are for

THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF OR OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, AND THE
OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL
BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

SECTION 9.12 CERTIFICATE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.

(a) The Certificates may not be acquired by or for the
account of a Benefit Plan unless the Benefit Plan acquiring a
Certificate has available to it an exemption from the prohibited
transaction rules under Section 406(a) of ERISA and Section 4975
of the Code and such exemption is applicable to the purchase and
holding of the Certificates. Unless such an exemption is
available, by accepting and holding a Certificate, the Holder
thereof and the Certificate Owner shall each be deemed to have
represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan and, if
requested to do so by the Seller pursuant to Section 3.4(b), the
Certificateholder and the Certificate Owner shall execute and
deliver to the Owner Trustee an Undertaking Letter in the form
set forth in EXHIBIT D. The Certificates are also subject to the
minimum denomination specified in Section 3.4(a).

(b) The Certificates will not be registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. 
Consequently, the Certificates are not transferable other than
pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and satisfaction of certain other provisions
specified herein. No sale, pledge or other transfer of the
Certificates (or interest therein) may be made by any Person
unless either (i) such sale, pledge or other transfer is made to
the Seller, (ii) such sale, pledge or other transfer is made to
an institutional investor that is an "accredited investor"
meeting the requirements of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of
Regulation D under the Securities Act (an "Institutional
Accredited Investor") that executes a certificate, substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, to the effect that it
is an Institutional Accredited Investor acting for its own
account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or
agent for others (which others also are Institutional Accredited
Investors unless the holder is a bank acting in its fiduciary
capacity), (iii) so long as the Certificates are eligible for
resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, such sale,
pledge or other transfer is made to a person whom the seller
reasonably believes after due inquiry is a "qualified
institutional buyers" within the meaning of Rule 144A under the
Securities Act (a "Qualified Institutional Buyer") acting for its
own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary
or agent for others (which others also are Qualified
Institutional Buyers) to whom notice is given that the sale,

34<PAGE>
<PAGE>39

pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under
the Securities Act, or (iv) such sale, pledge or other transfer
is otherwise made in a transaction exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, in which case (A) the Owner
Trustee shall require that both the prospective transferor and
the prospective transferee certify to the Owner Trustee and the
Seller in writing the facts surrounding such transfer, which
certification shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the
Owner Trustee and the Seller, and (B) the Owner Trustee shall
require a written opinion of counsel (which will not be at the
expense of the Seller or the Owner Trustee) satisfactory to the
Seller and the Owner Trustee to the effect that such transfer
will not violate the Securities Act. No sale, pledge or other
transfer may be made to any one person for Certificates with a
face amount of less than $250,000 and, in the case of any person
acting on behalf of one or more third parties (other than a bank
(as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) acting in
its fiduciary capacity), for Certificates with a face amount of
less than $250,000 for each such third party. Neither the Seller
nor the Owner Trustee shall be obligated to register the
Certificates under the Securities Act, qualify the Certificates
under the securities laws of any state or provide registration
rights to any purchaser or holder thereof.

(c) Each Certificate shall bear a legend to the effect
set forth in subsections (a) and (b) above.

(d) The Seller shall be responsible for determining
compliance with the restrictions set forth in this Section 9.12.

SECTION 9.13 INDEMNIFICATION BY AND REIMBURSEMENT OF
THE SERVICER. The Owner Trustee acknowledges and agrees to
reimburse (i) the Servicer and its directors, officers, employees
and agents in accordance with Section 7.3(b) of the Trust Sale
and Servicing Agreement and (ii) the Seller and its directors,
officers, employees and agents in accordance with Section 3.4 of
the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement. The Owner Trustee
further acknowledges and accepts the conditions and limitations
with respect to the Servicer's obligation to indemnify, defend
and hold the Owner Trustee harmless as set forth in Section
7.1(a) of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed by their respective officers
hereunto duly authorized, as of the day and year first above
written.

<PAGE>43

THIS CERTIFIES THAT __________ is the registered owner
of a nonassessable, fully-paid, fractional undivided interest in
Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I (the "TRUST")
formed by Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation, a Delaware
corporation.

The Trust was created pursuant to a Trust Agreement,
dated as of January 25, 1994 (as amended and supplemented from
time to time, the "TRUST AGREEMENT"), between the Seller and
Citibank Delaware, as owner trustee (the "OWNER TRUSTEE"), a
summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of which is set
forth below. To the extent not otherwise defined herein, the
capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them
in the Trust Agreement.

This Certificate is one of the duly authorized
Certificates designated as "Floating Rate Asset-Backed
Certificates, Class A" (the "CERTIFICATES"). This Certificate is
issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Trust Agreement, the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof, to which
Trust Agreement the holder of this Certificate by virtue of the
acceptance hereof assents and by which such holder is bound.

Under the Trust Agreement, there shall be distributed
on the 15th day of each calendar month or, if such 15th day is
not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, commencing
on February 15, 1994 (each, a "DISTRIBUTION DATE"), to the person
in whose name this Certificate is registered on the related
Record Date (as defined below), interest accrued hereon to the
extent of funds available therefor and such Certificateholder's
fractional undivided interest in the amount of distributions in
respect of Certificate Balance to be distributed to Certificate-
holders on such Distribution Date. Interest shall accrue on this
Certificate at the applicable Certificate Rate (as set forth on
the reverse hereof) and interest accrued hereon as of any
Distribution Date but not distributed on such Distribution Date
shall be due on the next Distribution Date. No distributions of
Certificate Balance shall be made on any Certificate until all
Notes have been paid (or provided for) in full. The entire
unpaid Certificate Balance on this Certificate shall be due and
payable on the Distribution Date in January 1999 (the "STATED
FINAL PAYMENT DATE"). However, the actual distribution in full
of the Certificate could occur sooner or later than such date. 
The "Record Date," with respect to any Distribution Date, means
the last day of the preceding Collection Period.

The distributions in respect of Certificate Balance and
interest on this Certificate are payable in such coin or currency
of the United States of America as at the time of distribution is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts. All
distributions made by the Trust with respect to this Certificate
shall be applied first to interest due and payable on this
Certificate as provided above and then to the unpaid
distributions in respect of Certificate Balance of this
Certificate.

<PAGE>44

The Holder of this Certificate acknowledges and agrees
that its rights to receive distributions in respect of this
Certificate are subordinated to the rights of the Noteholders as
and to the extent described in the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement and the Indenture.

It is the intention of the Seller, the Servicer and the
Certificateholders and Certificate Owners that, solely for
purposes of federal income, state and local income and franchise
taxes, Michigan single business tax and any other taxes imposed
upon, measured by or based upon gross or net income, the Trust
shall be treated as a partnership. Except as otherwise required
by appropriate taxing authorities, the Seller and the other
Certificateholders and Certificate Owners by acceptance of a
Certificate (or interest therein), agree to treat, and to take no
action inconsistent with the treatment of, the Certificates for
such tax purposes as interests in such partnership.

Each Certificateholder or Certificate Owner, by its
acceptance of a Certificate (or interest therein), (i) expresses
its intention that the Certificates will qualify under applicable
tax law as partnership interests in a partnership which holds the
estate of the Trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders and
(ii) unless otherwise required by appropriate taxing authorities,
agrees to treat the Certificates as interests in such a
partnership for purposes of federal income, state and local
income and franchise taxes, Michigan single business tax and any
other taxes imposed upon, measured by or based upon gross or net
income.

Each Certificateholder or Certificate Owner, by its
acceptance of a Certificate (or interest therein), covenants and
agrees that such Certificateholder or Certificate Owner, as the
case may be, shall not, prior to the date which is one year and
one day after the termination of the Trust Agreement, acquiesce,
petition or otherwise invoke or cause the Seller to invoke the
process of any court or governmental authority for the purpose of
commencing or sustaining a case against the Seller under any
federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the
Seller or any substantial part of its property, or ordering the
winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Seller. [By its
acceptance of this Certificate, the Seller agrees that it shall
not be deemed to have approved the commencement of a voluntary
proceeding in bankruptcy relating to the Trust for purposes of
Section 4.3 of the Trust Agreement unless such commencement was
approved by the affirmative vote of all of the members of the
Seller's board of directors.]

Distributions on this Certificate shall be made as
provided in the Trust Agreement without the presentation or
surrender of this Certificate or the making of any notation
hereon, to each Certificateholder of record on the immediately
preceding Record Date either by wire transfer, in immediately
available funds, to the account of such Holder at a bank or other
entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such

5

<PAGE>45

Certificateholder shall have provided to the Certificate
Registrar appropriate written instructions at least five Business
Days prior to such Record Date, or, if not, by check mailed to
such Certificateholder at the address of such Holder appearing in
the Certificate Register; provided that with respect to
Certificates registered on the Record Date in the name of the
nominee of the Clearing Agency (initially, such nominee to be
Cede & Co.), distributions shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the account designated by such
nominee. Except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement and
notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this
Certificate shall be made after due notice by the Owner Trustee
of the pendency of such distribution and only upon presentation
and surrender of this Certificate at the office maintained for
such purpose by the Owner Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan,
the City of New York.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of
this Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof, which further
provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set
forth at this place.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall
have been executed by an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee
by manual signature, this Certificate shall not entitle the
holder hereof to any benefit under the Trust Agreement or the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF
OR OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such holder and on
all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued
upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent is made upon this
Certificate. The Trust Agreement also permits the amendment
thereof, in certain circumstances, without the consent of the
Holders of any of the Certificates or the Notes.

The term "Certificate Rate" as used in this Certificate
means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the product of (i) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from
and including the prior Distribution Date (or, in the case of the
Initial Distribution Date, from and including the Initial Closing
Date) to but excluding such Distribution Date and the denominator
of which is 360 and (ii) LIBOR plus .45% (or, in the case of the
Initial Distribution Date, 3.575%).

As provided in the Trust Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is
registerable in the Certificate Register upon surrender of this
Certificate for registration of transfer at the offices or agencies
of the Certificate Registrar maintained by the Owner Trustee in the
City of New York, accompanied by (i) a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such
Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, (ii) any certificate
and/or Opinion of Counsel required by Section 9.12(b) of the Trust
Agreement, and (iii) if requested by the Seller, the Undertaking

<PAGE>48

Letter required by Section 9.12(a) of the Trust Agreement, and
thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same class of
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate interest in
the Trust shall be issued to the designated transferee.

The initial Certificate Registrar appointed under the
Trust Agreement is Citibank, N.A.

The Certificates are issuable only as registered
Certificates without coupons in denominations of $250,000 or
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the
Trust Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new Certificates of the
same class of authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Certificate may be subdivided upon
transfer or exchange in a manner such that the resulting Certificate
if it had been sold in the original offering would have had an
initial offering price of less than $250,000. No service charge
shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but
the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable
in connection therewith.

The Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and any agent
of the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the
person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and none of the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar or any such agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

The obligations and responsibilities created by the Trust
Agreement and the Trust created thereby shall terminate upon the
distribution to Certificateholders of all amounts required to be
paid to them pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement and the disposition of all property held as part
of the Trust.

Citibank Delaware,
as Owner Trustee of Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I
One Penn's Way
New Castle, Delaware 19720

Ladies and Gentlemen:

In connection with our proposed purchase of a Floating
Rate Asset-Backed Certificate, Class A (the "Certificate"),
representing a fractional undivided interest in the Superior
Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust I, issued under a trust
agreement, dated as of January 25, 1994 (the "Trust Agreement"),
between Wholesale Auto Receivables Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Seller") and Citibank Delaware, as owner trustee,
acting thereunder not in its individual capacity but solely as owner
trustee of the Trust (the "Owner Trustee"), we confirm that:

1. We understand that the Certificate has not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), and may not be sold except as
permitted in the following sentence. We agree, on our
own behalf and on behalf of any accounts for which we are
acting as hereinafter stated, that such Certificate may
be resold, pledged or transferred only (i) to the Seller,
(ii) to an institutional investor that is an "Accredited
Investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)(1),(2),(3) or (7) (an
"Institutional Accredited Investor") under the Securities
Act (as indicated by the box checked by the transferor on
the Certificate of Transfer on the reverse of the
certificate for the Certificate) acting for its own
account (and not for the account of others) or as a
fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are
Institutional Accredited Investors unless the holder is
a bank acting in its fiduciary capacity) that executes a
certificate substantially in the form hereof, (iii) so
long as such Certificate is eligible for resale pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A"), to
a person whom we reasonably believe after due inquiry to
be a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined in Rule
144A acting for its own account (and not for the account
of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which
others also are "qualified institutional buyers" to whom
notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is
being made in reliance on Rule 144A, or (iv) in a sale,
pledge or other transfer made in a transaction otherwise

exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, in which case (A) the Owner Trustee shall
require that both the prospective transferor and the
prospective transferee certify to the Owner Trustee and
the Seller in writing the facts surrounding such
transfer, which certification shall be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the
Seller, and (B) the Owner Trustee shall require a written
opinion of counsel (which will not be at the expense of
the Seller or the Owner Trustee) satisfactory to the
Seller and the Owner Trustee to the effect that such
transfer will not violate the Securities Act, in each
case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of
any state of the United States. We will notify any
purchaser of the Certificate from us of the above resale
restrictions, if then applicable. We further understand
that in connection with any transfer of the Certificate
by us that the Seller and the Owner Trustee may request,
and if so requested we will furnish, such certificates
and other information as they may reasonably require to
confirm that any such transfer complies with the
foregoing restrictions. We understand that no sale,
pledge or other transfer may be made to any one person
for Certificates with a face amount of less than $250,000
and, in the case of any person acting on behalf of one or
more third parties (other than a bank (as defined in
Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) acting in its
fiduciary capacity), for Certificates with a face amount
of less than $250,000 for each such third party.

2. 

[CHECK ONE]

/ / (a) We are an institutional investor
and an "accredited investor" (as
defined in Rule 501(a)(1),(2),(3) or

Securities Act) acting for our own
account (and not for the account of
others) or as a fiduciary or agent
for others (which others also are
Institutional Accredited Investors
unless we are bank acting in its
fiduciary capacity). We have such
knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters as to
be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of our investment in the
Certificate, and we and any accounts
for which we are acting are each
able to bear the economic risk of
our or its investment for an
indefinite period of time. We are
acquiring the Certificate for
investment and not with a view to,
or for offer and sale in connection
with, a public distribution.

institutional buyers"). We are
familiar with Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and are aware that
the seller of the Certificate and
other parties intend to rely on the
statements made herein and the
exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act
provided by Rule 144A.
