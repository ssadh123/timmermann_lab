Item 5. Other Events

On January 19, 1994, the Registrant announced that it intends
to relocate its home canning cap and lid manufacturing operations from Chicago,
Illinois to a new manufacturing facility in Jackson, Tennessee and to
permanently cease operations in its leased facility in Chicago.

The Registrant expects that this relocation will result in
improved efficiencies and cost reductions of approximately $3,000,000 pre-tax
per year ($1,836,000 after-tax or 50 cents per common share, primary and fully
diluted, per year). Relocation to Jackson is expected to be completed by the
end of 1994, with partial savings to be realized in 1995. Full savings are
expected to be realized in 1996.

The Registrant will record a reserve in the fourth quarter of
1993 for the expected costs associated with the relocation of the home canning
cap and lid manufacturing operations of $4,500,000 pre-tax ($2,754,000
after-tax or 75 cents per common share, primary and fully diluted).

A copy of the press release announcing the foregoing is
attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
