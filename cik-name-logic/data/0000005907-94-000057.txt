REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Shareowners of AT&T Corp.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the
consolidated financial statement schedules of AT&T Corp. (AT&T) and
subsidiaries listed in the index on page 2 of this Form 8-K. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of AT&T's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AT&T
and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information required to be included therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 1993 AT&T changed
its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits, postemployment benefits
and income taxes.

More than 50% Fully consolidated
20% to 50% Equity method 
Less than 20% Cost method
_____________________________________________________________________
We include the accounts of operations located outside the U.S. on the basis
of their fiscal years, ended either November 30 or December 31.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

For the business we transact in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we
translate income statement amounts at average exchange rates for the year,
and we translate assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates. We
show the adjustments from balance sheet translation as a separate component
of shareowners' equity. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue from Basis of recognition
_____________________________________________________________________
Telecommunications Minutes of traffic processed and 
Services contracted fees
Products and Systems Upon performance of contractual 
obligations
Rentals and Other Proportionately over contract 
Services period or as services are 
performed
Financial Services Over the life of the finance 
and Leasing receivables using the interest
method
_____________________________________________________________________

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We expense research and development expenditures as incurred (including
development costs of software that we plan to sell) until technological
feasibility is established. After that time, we capitalize the remaining
software production costs as other assets and amortize them to product
costs over the estimated period of sales.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense is the interest on short-term and long-term debt and
accrued liabilities, excluding the interest related to our financial
services operations, which is included in cost of financial services and
leasing, and net of interest capitalized in connection with construction. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8 
Form 8-K 
October 26, 1994 AT&T Corp.

INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS

For financial reporting purposes, we amortize investment tax credits as a
reduction to the provision for income taxes over the useful lives of the
property that produced the credits.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

We use the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding during each period to compute earnings per
common share. Common stock equivalents are stock options that we assume to
be exercised for the purposes of this computation.

TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS

We consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents for cash flow
reporting purposes. They are highly liquid and have original maturities
generally of three months or less.

INVENTORIES

We state inventories at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost
principally on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

We state property, plant and equipment at cost and determine depreciation
using either the group or unit method. The unit method is used primarily
for factory facilities, laboratory equipment, large computer systems, and
certain international earth stations and submarine cables. The group
method is used for most other depreciable assets. Repair and maintenance
costs are charged to expense when incurred. Renewals and betterments are
capitalized. Gains or losses on disposition of property and equipment are
reflected in income currently. When we dispose of assets that were
depreciated using the unit method, we include the gains or losses in
operating results. When we sell or retire plant that was depreciated using
the group method, we deduct the original cost from the plant account and
from accumulated depreciation.
We use accelerated depreciation methods for factory facilities and
digital equipment used in the telecommunications network, except switching
equipment placed in service before 1989. All other plant and equipment is
depreciated on a straight-line basis.
In our Wireless Services Unit, property and equipment are stated at cost. 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets which are generally 10 to 12 years for cellular,
2 to 12 years for messaging, 10 to 20 years for broadcast, 3 to 12 years
for air-to-ground and 3 to 5 years for other equipment. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of
the leases.

LICENSING COSTS

Licensing costs primarily represent costs incurred to develop or acquire
cellular and messaging licenses. Generally, amortization begins with the
commencement of service to customers and is computed using the straight-
line method over a period of 40 years.

Form 8-K 
October 26, 1994 AT&T Corp.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of
net assets acquired in business combinations treated as purchases. We
amortize goodwill on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited,
principally in the range of 10 to 40 years. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS

We reclassified certain amounts for previous years to conform with the 1993
presentation.

2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ......................................

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS 

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"
effective January 1, 1993. This standard requires us to accrue estimated
future retiree benefits during the years employees are working and
accumulating these benefits. Previously, we expensed health care benefits
as claims were incurred and life insurance benefits as plans were funded.
When we adopted the new standard, we had an accumulated liability related
to past service from retirees and active employees. A portion of that
liability was provided for by group life insurance benefits and trusts for
health care benefits funded before 1993.
We also reimburse the divested regional Bell companies for a portion of
their costs to provide health care benefits, increases in pensions and
other benefits to predivestiture retirees under the terms of the
Divestiture Plan of Reorganization. Through 1992 we expensed these
reimbursements as incurred. In January 1993 we recognized this liability
in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 106. 
We elected to record a one-time pretax charge of $11,317 million to
record the unfunded portions of these liabilities. That charge reflects
$12,986 million of liabilities less $1,669 million of plan assets and
amounts previously recorded. After taxes, that charge was $7,023 million
($5.19 per share), including $1,375 million for predivestiture retirees. 
Apart from these cumulative effects on prior years of the accounting
change, our change in accounting had no material effect on net income in
1993 and is not expected to affect net income materially in future periods. 
This change does not affect cash flows.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

We also adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," effective January 1, 1993. Analogous to SFAS No. 106, this
standard requires us to accrue for estimated future postemployment
benefits, including separation payments, during the years employees are
working and accumulating these benefits, and for disability payments when
the disabilities occur. Before this change in accounting, we recognized
costs for separations when they were identified and disability benefits
when they were paid.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10 
Form 8-K 
October 26, 1994 AT&T Corp.

When we adopted the new standard, we had an accumulated liability for
payments to employees who were then disabled and for benefits related to
the past service of active employees. We recorded a one-time pretax charge
of $1,809 million to record the unprovided portion of these liabilities. 
That charge reflects $2,221 million of liabilities less $412 million of
reserves for business restructuring activities that were established before
1993 and reclassified to postemployment liabilities as part of this
accounting change. After taxes, that charge was $1,128 million ($0.83 per
share). The change in accounting reduced operating income by $301 million,
and net income by $171 million ($0.13 per share) in 1993. This change does
not affect cash flows.

INCOME TAXES

We also adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective
January 1, 1993. Among other provisions, this standard requires us to
compute deferred tax accounts using the enacted corporate income tax rates
for the years in which the taxes will be paid or refunds received. Before
1993 our deferred tax accounts reflected the rates in effect when we made
the deferrals.
The adoption of this standard reduced net income by $1,457 million 
($0.94 per share) as a result of deferred liabilities that were created by
McCaw Cellular Communications' ("McCaw") acquisitions prior to the merger. 
Apart from this reduction, the new accounting method had no material
effect on net income in 1993. Unless Congress changes tax rates, we do not
expect this change to affect net income materially in future periods. This
change does not affect cash flows.

3. PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING CHANGES ........................................

DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

In 1994 we must adopt SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities." This standard addresses the accounting and
reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. We do
not expect this new standard to affect net income materially at or after
adoption, and it will not affect cash flows. 

IMPAIRED LOANS

By 1995 we must adopt SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan." This standard requires us to compute present values for
impaired loans when determining our allowances for credit losses. We do
not expect this new standard to affect net income materially at or after
adoption, and it will not affect cash flows.

4. MERGER WITH MCCAW CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS, INC. ......................

On September 19, 1994, AT&T merged with McCaw. As a result, 197.5
million shares of McCaw common stock were converted into AT&T common stock
at an exchange ratio of 1 share of AT&T common stock for each McCaw share. 
In addition, AT&T assumed 11.3 million McCaw options which were converted
into AT&T stock options at the same exchange ratio resulting in 11.3
million additional AT&T stock options at an average exercise price of
$27.01. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the
consolidated financial statements of AT&T have been restated for all
periods prior to the merger to include the accounts and operations of
McCaw. Intercompany transactions have not been eliminated due to the
immateriality of the amounts involved. Certain reclassifications have been
made to McCaw's accounts to conform to AT&T's presentation. Operating
results of the companies for periods prior to the merger were:

6. BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES...............................

Provisions for business restructuring include the estimated costs of
specific plans to close offices, consolidate facilities, relocate employees
and fulfill contractual obligations, and of other activities involved in
restructuring operations. These provisions also cover separation payments
made as a result of special offers related to defined benefit plans. 
Before we changed our accounting for postemployment benefits in 1993, costs
for other types of separation payments were also included in these
provisions. 
Our $498 million in provisions for business restructuring in 1993 covered
$227 million of costs at AT&T Global Information Solutions (including, in
millions, $137 for special termination benefits, $43 for closing
facilities, $18 for employee relocation, $19 for contractual obligations
and $10 for other related expenses). We also provided $215 million for
reengineering customer support functions for telecommunications services
(including, in millions, $55 for employee relocation, $25 for outplacement 
costs, $30 for legal contingencies and $105 for closing facilities, lease
terminations and asset abandonments associated with centralizing support
services). The remaining provisions consist of $23 million related to
closing plants for manufacturing telecommunications network systems, and
$33 million for employee relocation, outplacement services and legal
liabilities related to restructuring operations that service the U.S.
federal government.

October 26, 1994 AT&T Corp.

In 1991 we recorded approximately $4.5 billion of business restructuring
and other charges, reducing net income by $2,863 million ($2.21 per share). 
The charges covered estimated costs of changes in our computer operations,
PBX operations and product distribution processes; consolidating operations
in leased and owned buildings and recognizing costs of vacant space;
eliminating a future subsidy to an Alaskan long distance company; writing
down an investment; and other restructuring-related activities, merger-
related expenses and other charges. We recorded these charges as $3,572
million in provisions for business restructuring; $501 million as selling,
general and administrative expenses; $123 million as cost of products and
systems; and the remainder as other costs and expenses, including other
income - net. Charges included in other accounts in 1991 were primarily for
expenses related to the restructuring activities, writing down impaired
assets and merger-related expenses.
The remaining reserves for separation payments at January 1, 1993, were
included in the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for
postemployment benefits. We believe that the balance of reserves for all
other business restructuring activities, $1,440 million at December 31,
1993, is adequate for the completion of those activities.

7. OTHER INCOME-NET.......................................................

In June 1993 we sold our remaining 77% interest in UNIX System
Laboratories, Inc. to Novell, Inc. (Novell) in exchange for approximately
3% of Novell common stock. Our gain on the sale was $217 million.
In 1993 we incurred an expense of $124 million associated with the write
down of equipment.
We sold our remaining interest in Compagnie Industriali Riunite S.p.A. in
1993 for a slight gain. We reduced the carrying value of that investment
by $68 million in 1992 and by $218 million in 1991 because of a sustained
decline in its market value.
We accrued $134 million for a preferred stock dividend in 1993, 1992 and
1991 for the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock issued by LCH
Communications ("LCH"), a subsidiary of LIN Broadcasting ("LIN"), (a
subsidiary of McCaw).
In 1991 we had a $171 million gain from selling our 19% equity investment
in Sun Microsystems, Inc.
We also had a $243 million gain on the sale of our cellular assets in
Indiana, Wisconsin and Illinois to BellSouth. 

8. SALE OF STOCK BY SUBSIDIARIES ........................................

In August 1993 AT&T Capital Corporation sold 5,750,000 shares of common
stock in an initial public offering and approximately 850,000 shares of
common stock in a management offering. That was about 14% of the shares
outstanding, so our ownership is now about 86%. The shares were sold at
$21.50 per share, yielding net proceeds of $115 million excluding $18
million of recourse loans attributable to the management offering. Because
of these loans, we recorded a $9 million loss on the sale. When the loans
are collected in seven years, we expect to report a net $6 million gain
from this sale of stock.
In 1991 UNIX Systems Laboratories, Inc. sold about 20% of its stock to
other companies to encourage their support for open computing standards. 
We had a $43 million gain on that sale. Proceeds from the sale were in
cash and we did not provide for deferred taxes on the gain.

Deferred tax liabilities are taxes we expect to pay in future
periods. Similarly, deferred tax assets are taxes we expect to
get refunded in future periods. Deferred taxes arise because of
differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and
liabilities.

A consortium of lenders provides revolving credit facilities of $6
billion to AT&T and $2 billion to AT&T Capital Corp. (AT&T Capital). These
facilities are intended for general corporate purposes, which include
support for AT&T's and AT&T Capital's commercial paper. They were unused
at December 31, 1993. 

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS ...............................................

PENSION PLANS

We sponsor non-contributory defined benefit plans covering the majority of
our employees. Benefits for management employees are principally based on
career-average pay. Benefits for occupational employees are not directly
pay-related.
Pension contributions are principally determined using the aggregate cost
method and are primarily made to trust funds held for the sole benefit of
plan participants. We compute pension cost using the projected unit credit
method and assumed a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 9.0% in
1993, 9.0% in 1992 and 8.6% in 1991. Pension cost includes the following
components:

The prepaid pension costs shown above are net of pension liabilities for
plans where accumulated plan benefits exceed assets. Such liabilities are
included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
We are amortizing over approximately 15.9 years the unrecognized
transition asset related to our 1986 adoption of SFAS No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions." We amortize prior service costs primarily on a
straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active
employees. Our plan assets consist primarily of listed stocks (including
$378 million and $451 million of AT&T common stock at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively), corporate and governmental debt, real estate
investments, and cash and cash equivalents.

SAVINGS PLANS

We sponsor savings plans for the majority of our employees. The plans
allow employees to contribute a portion of their pretax and/or after-tax
income in accordance with specified guidelines. We match a percentage of
the employee contributions up to certain limits. Our contributions in
millions amounted to $347 in 1993, $331 in 1992 and $279 in 1991.

We made these assumptions in valuing our postretirement
benefit obligation at December 31, 1993:

===========================================================
Weighted-average discount rate 7.5%
Expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets 9.0%
Assumed rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits 9.4% 
=========================================================== 

We assumed that the growth in the per capita cost of covered health care
benefits (the health care cost trend rate) would gradually decline after
1994 to 5.6% by the year 2021 and then remain level. This assumption
greatly affects the amounts reported. To illustrate, increasing the
assumed trend rate by 1% in each year would raise our accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 by $758 million and
our 1993 postretirement benefit costs by $64 million.

15. STOCK OPTIONS ........................................................

In our Long Term Incentive Program, we grant stock options, stock
appreciation rights (SARs), either in tandem with stock options or
free-standing, and other awards. On January 1 of each year, 0.6% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock become available for grant. The
exercise price of any stock option is equal to or greater than the stock
price when the option is granted. When granted in tandem, exercise of an
option or SAR cancels the other to the extent of such exercise. Before our
mergers with McCaw, NCR and Teradata, stock options were granted under the
separate stock option plans of those companies. No new options can be
granted under those plans. Option transactions are shown below:

During 1993 167,747 SARs were exercised and no SARs were granted. At
December 31, 1993, 925,210 SARs remained unexercised and all of these were
exercisable.

16. SEGMENT INFORMATION ..................................................

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Our operations in the global information movement and management industry
involve providing wireline and wireless telecommunications services,
business information processing systems, and other systems, products and
services that combine communications and computers. Our operations in the
financial services and leasing industry involve direct financing and
finance leasing programs for our products and the products of other
companies, leasing products to customers under operating leases and being
in the general-purpose credit card business. Miscellaneous other
activities, including the distribution of computer equipment through retail
outlets, in the aggregate, represent less than 10% of revenues, operating
income and identifiable assets and are included in the information movement
and management segment. Revenues between industry segments are not
material.

GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS

Transfers between geographic areas are on terms and conditions comparable
with sales to external customers. The methods followed in developing the
geographic area data require the use of estimation techniques and do not
take into account the extent to which product development, manufacturing
and marketing depend upon each other. Thus the information may not be
indicative of results if the geographic areas were independent
organizations.

Data on other geographic areas pertain to operations that are located
outside of the U.S. Our revenues from all international activities,
including those in the table, international telecommunications services and
exports, provided 24.4% of consolidated revenues in 1993.
Business restructuring and other charges were taken primarily in the
information movement and management segment and the U.S. geographic area. 
Corporate assets are principally cash and temporary cash investments.

17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ................................................

We use various financial instruments in the normal course of our business. 
By their nature all such instruments involve risk, and our maximum
potential loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet. As
is customary for these types of instruments, we usually do not require
collateral or other security from other parties to these instruments. 
However, because we control our exposure to credit risk through credit
approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, we believe that our
reserves for losses are adequate. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 25 
Form 8-K 
October 26, 1994 AT&T Corp.

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

We participate in the general-purpose credit card business through AT&T
Universal Card Services Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary. We purchase
essentially all cardholder receivables under an agreement with the
Universal Bank, a subsidiary of Synovus Financial Corporation, which issues
the cards. 

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Letters of credit are purchased guarantees that ensure our performance or
payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions.

GUARANTEES OF DEBT

From time to time, we guarantee the financing for product purchases by
customers outside the U.S., and the debt of certain unconsolidated joint
ventures. 

INTEREST RATE AGREEMENTS

We enter into interest rate cap and swap agreements to manage our exposure
to changes in interest rates. The swap agreements generally involve the
exchange of fixed or floating interest payments without the exchange of the
underlying principal amounts. For cap agreements, we pay premiums to
protect us from rising interest rates on our floating rate debt.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts, including forward,
option and swap contracts, to manage our exposure to changes in currency
exchange rates.

18. CONTINGENCIES ........................................................

In the normal course of business we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits
and other claims, including proceedings under government laws and
regulations related to environmental and other matters. Such matters are
subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with
assurance. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate
amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these
matters at December 31, 1993. While these matters could affect the
operating results of any one quarter when resolved in future periods, we
believe that after final disposition, any monetary liability or financial
impact to us beyond that provided for at year-end would not be material to
our annual consolidated financial statements. 

19. AT&T CREDIT HOLDINGS, INC. ...........................................

In connection with the March 31, 1993 legal restructuring of AT&T Capital
Holdings, Inc. (formerly AT&T Capital Corporation), we issued a direct,
full and unconditional guarantee of all the outstanding public debt of AT&T
Credit Holdings, Inc. (formerly AT&T Credit Corporation). 
AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc. holds the majority of AT&T's investment in
AT&T Capital Corporation and the lease finance assets of the former AT&T
Credit Corporation. The table below shows summarized consolidated
financial information for AT&T Credit Holdings, Inc., which consolidates
the accounts of AT&T Capital Corporation. Financial information for prior
periods was restated for the legal restructuring. The summarized financial
information includes transactions with AT&T that are eliminated in
consolidation.<PAGE>

The number of weighted average shares outstanding increases as we issue new
common shares for employee plans, shareowner plans and other purposes. For
this reason, the sum of quarterly earnings per common share may not be the
same as earnings per common share for the year, and the per share effects
of unusual items in a quarter may differ from the per share effects of
those same items for the year.

In the second quarter of 1993, we recorded $278 million in provisions for
business restructuring activities. The effect of these provisions was
offset by the $217 million gain from selling UNIX System Laboratories, Inc.
and other miscellaneous credits. In the fourth quarter of 1993, we
recorded a $190 million provision for business restructuring at AT&T Global
Information Solutions, which reduced net income by $119 million 
($0.09 per share).

21. PRIVATE MARKET VALUE GUARANTEE .......................................

We have entered in the Private Market Value Guarantee ("PMVG") with LIN for
the benefit of LIN's stockholders (other than AT&T and its affiliates). 
The PMVG provides that for as long as AT&T and its affiliates beneficially
own, in the aggregate, at least 25% of the outstanding shares of LIN Common
Stock ("Shares") on a fully diluted basis or our designees constitute a
majority of the board of directors of LIN, and any Shares are held by other
persons, a number of provisions shall apply. They include:
a) Three members of LIN's board of directors will be independent
directors ("directors") as determined under the New York Stock Exchange
Rules. The initial directors are persons who served on LIN's board of
directors prior to the completion by McCaw of its tender offer for LIN. 
New directors will be nominated by the current directors at each annual
meeting and elected by a majority vote of the public stockholders. 
Majority vote of the public stockholders means the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the public shares present and entitled to
vote at any meeting at which the holders of a majority of the public shares
are present, or the action by written consent of the holders of a majority
of the public shares.
b) On or about January 1, 1995 (the "Initiation Date"), the directors
will designate an investment banking firm of recognized national standing
and AT&T will designate an investment banking firm of recognized national
standing, in each case to determine the private market value per Share. 
Private market value per Share is the private market price per Share that
an unrelated third party would pay if it were to acquire all outstanding
Shares in an arm's length transaction assuming that LIN was being sold in a
manner designed to attract all possible participants and to maximize
stockholder value. 
Once the private market price is determined pursuant to the procedures
provided for in the PMVG, AT&T will have 45 days to decide whether it
desires to proceed with an acquisition of all of the public shares (an
"Acquisition")at that price. If AT&T decides to proceed with the
Acquisition, it may pay the private market price in cash or any combination
of cash, common equity securities and/or nonconvertible senior or
subordinated debt securities that the directors, after consultation with
their investment banking firm, believe in good faith will have an aggregate
market value, on a fully distributed basis, of not less than the private
market price. If AT&T determines to proceed with an Acquisition as set
forth above, it will enter into an agreement with LIN and will cause a
meeting of stockholders of LIN to be held as soon as practicable to
consider and vote thereon. The Acquisition may only be complete if it is
approved by a majority vote of the public stockholders.
If AT&T determines not to proceed with an Acquisition, or if despite
AT&T's good faith efforts and Acquisition has not been completed within 12
months following the Initiation Date (or if and Acquisition has been
approved by a majority vote of the public stockholders and is being pursued
in good faith by AT&T but has not been completed due to regulatory delays
or litigation within 20 months of the Initiation Date), AT&T will put LIN
in its entirety up for sale under direction of the directors in a manner
intended by the directors to maximize value for all shares. AT&T will not

<PAGE> 29 
Form 8-K 
October 26, 1994 AT&T Corp.

bid unless requested to do so by the directors. AT&T will fully cooperate
in this process and, if one or more of the transactions so selected by the
directors are approved by a majority vote of the public stockholders, will
cause all shares owned by it or its affiliates to be voted in favor
thereof.

22) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS .................................................... 

REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK OF A SUBSIDIARY

On June, 24, 1994, LCH redeemed all of the outstanding Redeemable Preferred
Stock of LCH held by Comcast Cellular Communications, Inc., a subsidiary of
Comcast Corporation, in exchange for all of the capital stock of a
subsidiary of LCH, whose assets consisted primarily of LIN's 49.99%
interest in the Philadelphia "A Block" cellular system ("Philadelphia") and
GuestInformant (a publisher of advertiser-supported hard cover magazines
placed in hotel rooms).
As a result of the redemption, we eliminated our net assets related to
Philadelphia and GuestInformant, recorded a gain on the sale of assets of
$11.9 million and recorded a tax benefit of $73.6 million due to the
transaction's impact on deferred taxes. There was also an increase in
additional paid-in capital and minority interests of $407.6 million and
$376.2 million respectively due to the preferred stock redemption.

DISTRIBUTION OF STOCK OF LIN TELEVISION CORPORATION........................

On June 8, 1994, LIN Broadcasting Corporation announced that it intends to
distribute the common stock of its indirect subsidiary, LIN Television
Corporation, to its stockholders on a tax-free basis pursuant to Section
355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It also announced that it
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA") with Cook Inlet
Communications Corp. ("CICC"), pursuant to which LIN Television would
acquire substantially all the assets and assume certain liabilities of
WYNH-TV from CICC in exchange for $120.2 million in cash subject to
adjustments as set forth in the APA, and approximately 11.5% of the common
stock of LIN Television.
As a result of the transaction, approximately 42.1% of LIN Televisions's
shares will be publicly traded. Approximately 11.5% will be owned by CICC
and approximately 46.4% will be owned by AT&T Corp. LIN Television intends
to apply for listing of its shares on the Nasdaq National Market. The
closing of the transaction is expected to occur by year-end. The record
date for the distribution will be announced at a later date.
