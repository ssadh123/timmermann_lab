ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On February 15, 1994, Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation
(the "Registrant") entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement")
with certain financial institutions named in the Credit Agreement and Bank of
America National Trust and Savings Association ("Bank of America"), for itself
and as Agent, pursuant to which such financial institutions have agreed to
advance the Registrant on an unsecured basis an aggregate of $1,000,000,000 for
the purchase of shares of capital stock of Viacom Inc. ("Viacom") pursuant to
the Subscription Agreement dated January 7, 1994, between the Registrant and
Viacom. A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto and is incorporated
herein by reference as Exhibit 99.

The Credit Agreement requires, among other items, that the
Registrant maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain financial
covenants.

All amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are due and
payable on February 14, 1995. A Change of Control (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) of the Registrant constitutes an event of default under the Credit
Agreement. Accordingly, if the proposed merger of the Registrant with and into
Viacom (the "Merger") pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated January 7, 1994,
between the Registrant and Viacom occurs prior to February 14, 1995, the
Registrant must obtain a waiver of the Change of Control provision of the
Credit Agreement from Bank of America or else it will be obligated to repay the
indebtedness evidenced by the Credit Agreement upon consummation of the Merger.

ARTICLE II
THE CREDITS

2.01 Amounts and Terms of Commitments. Each Bank severally agrees,
on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make a single Loan to the
Company on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date to the
Availability Date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
the amount set forth opposite the Bank's name in Schedule 2.01 under the
heading "Commitment" (such amount as the same may be reduced pursuant to
Section 2.05 or as a result of one or more assignments pursuant to Section
10.08, the Bank's "Commitment"); provided, however, that, after giving effect
to any Borrowing of Committed Loans, the aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Committed Loans shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment. The
Commitment of each Bank shall terminate on the Availability Date. Any
principal amount of the Loans borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.01 which is
repaid or prepaid by the Company may not be reborrowed.

2.02 Loan Accounts. The Committed Loans made by each Bank shall be
evidenced by one or more loan accounts maintained by such Bank in the ordinary
course of business and not, except pursuant to Section 10.08, by promissory
notes. The loan accounts maintained by the Agent and each Bank shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error, of the amount of the Committed Loans made by
the Banks to the Company and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to
record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect
the obligation of the Company hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to
the Committed Loans. In the case of any dispute, action or proceeding relating
to any amount payable hereunder, the entries in each such account shall
constitute conclusive evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded.
In case of a discrepancy between the entries in the Agent's books and any
Bank's books, such Bank's books shall be considered correct in the absence of
manifest error.

2.03 Procedure for Committed Borrowings.

multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) into Offshore Rate
Committed Loans;

(ii) elect to convert at the end of any Interest

Funding Date, the Company shall only continue such Offshore Rate
Committed Loans for Interest Periods no longer than seven (7) days and
during the second thirty (30) days following the Initial Funding Date,
the Company shall only continue such Offshore Rate Committed Loans for

the Agent will promptly, no later than the same day, notify each Bank
thereof, or, if no timely notice is provided, the Agent will promptly

respective outstanding principal amounts of the Committed Loans with
respect to which the notice was given held by each Bank.

(e) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation
of any Loans, there shall not be more than 15 different Interest
Periods in effect in respect of all Committed Loans.

2.05 Termination or Reduction of Commitments.

(a) Prior to the Availability Date, the Company may, upon
not less than five Business Days' prior notice to the Agent, terminate
the Aggregate Commitments or permanently reduce the Aggregate
Commitment by an aggregate minimum amount

23
<PAGE> 30
of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;
and, provided, further, that once reduced in accordance with this
Section 2.05, the Aggregate Commitments may not be increased. Any
reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to each Bank's
Commitment in accordance with such Bank's Commitment Percentage. If
the Commitments are terminated in their entirety, all accrued
commitment fees to, but not including, the effective date of such
termination shall be payable on the effective date of such termination
without any premium or penalty.

(b) Prior to the Availability Date, if the Company
receives any cash payment (other than non-extraordinary cash
dividends) with respect to its investment in Viacom pursuant to
Section 5(c) of the Subscription Agreement or otherwise, or should
Viacom reduce the Company's obligations to invest in Viacom the
Company shall reduce the Aggregate Commitment by the amount of such
payment (in the case of Section 5(c) of the Subscription Agreement, on
a pro rata basis with respect to loans made by the banks under the
Existing Credit Agreement for the purchase of shares of stock of
Viacom pursuant to the Subscription Agreement) or reduction.

2.06 Optional Prepayments of Loans. Subject to Section 3.04, the
Company may, at any time or from time to time, upon at least three Business
Days' written notice to the Agent with respect to Offshore Committed Loans, and
one Business Day's notice with respect to Reference Rate Committed Loans,
ratably prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part in minimum amounts of
$5,000,000 ($2,500,000 for Reference Rate Loans). Such notice of prepayment
shall be delivered by 11:00 a.m (New York time) on the applicable day and shall
specify the date and amount of such prepayment and whether such prepayment is
of Reference Rate Committed Loans or Offshore Rate Committed Loans, or any
combination thereof. Such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the
Company and the Agent will promptly notify each Bank thereof and of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given, the Company
shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice
shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued
interest to each such date on the amount prepaid and the amounts required
pursuant to Section 3.04.

2.07 Repayment/Mandatory Prepayments.

(a) The Company shall repay the principal amount of the
Loans on the Termination Date.

(b) If the Company receives any other cash payment (other
than non-extraordinary cash dividends) with respect to its investment
in Viacom pursuant to Section 5(c) of the Subscription Agreement or
otherwise, or should Viacom reduce

24
<PAGE> 31
the Company's obligations to invest in Viacom such payments shall be
applied to repay the Loans and any outstanding accrued interest and
fees in the amount of such payments or proceeds, in the case of
Section 5(c) of the Subscription Agreement, on a pro rata basis with
respect to loans made by the banks under the Existing Credit Agreement
for the purchase of shares of Viacom pursuant to the Subscription
Agreement.

(c) If the Company shall receive any cash payment of the
Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the Subscription Agreement), the
Company shall apply such payment to repay the Loans and any
outstanding accrued interest and fees in the amount of such payment.

(d) With respect to any prepayments pursuant to Sections
2.07(b) or (c) above, if any Reference Rate Loans are then
outstanding, the Company shall first immediately prepay Reference Rate
Committed Loans. If no Reference Rate Committed Loans are then
outstanding, the Company shall on the first day make such payment of
Offshore Rate Committed Loans which is the last day of an Interest
Period for any Offshore Rate Committed Loans only if the Interest
Period does not exceed thirty days, otherwise the Company shall make
such payment within thirty days.

2.08 Interest.

(a) Subject to subsection 2.08(d), each Committed Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from
the date when made until it becomes due at a rate per annum equal to
the Offshore Rate or the Reference Rate, as the case may be, plus the
Applicable Margin.

(b) Interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date. Interest shall also be payable on the
date of any prepayment of Loans for the portion of the Loans so
prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in full thereof.
During the existence of any Event of Default, interest shall be
payable on demand.

(c) While any Event of Default exists or upon
acceleration, and unless and until such Event of Default is waived,
the Company shall pay interest (after as well as before judgment to
the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all Loans
outstanding, at a rate per annum which is determined by increasing the
Applicable Margin then in effect by 2% per annum; provided, however,
that, on and after the expiration of the Interest Period applicable to
any Offshore Rate Committed Loan outstanding on the date of occurrence
of such Event of Default or acceleration, the principal amount of such
Loan shall, during the continuation of such Event of

25
<PAGE> 32
Default or upon acceleration, bear interest at a fluctuating rate per
annum equal to the Reference Rate plus 2%.

(d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
obligations of the Company hereunder shall be subject to the
limitation that payments of interest shall not be required, for any
period for which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but
only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by
the respective Bank would be contrary to the provisions of any law
applicable to such Bank limiting the highest rate of interest which
may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Bank, and
in such event the Company shall pay such Bank interest at the highest
rate permitted by applicable law.

2.09 Fees.

(a) Commitment Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent
for the account of each Bank a commitment fee on the unutilized daily
unused portion of such Bank's Commitment equal to 0.25% per annum.
Such commitment fee shall accrue from January 7, 1994 to the
Availability Date or the Termination Date and shall be due and payable
on the Availability Date, or if earlier, the date the Loans are made
or the Termination Date.

(b) Other Fees. The Company shall pay BofA and the Agent
such other fees in the amounts and at the times set forth in letter
agreements and term sheet among the Company, BofA and the Arranger
dated January 7, 1994 and January 20, 1994.

2.10 Computation of Fees and Interest.

(a) All computations of interest payable in respect of
Reference Rate Committed Loans and all computations of fees shall be
made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and actual days elapsed. All other computations of interest under
this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual
days elapsed. Interest and fees shall accrue during each period
during which interest or such fees are computed from the first day
thereof to the last day thereof.

(b) The Agent will, with respect to the Offshore Rate at
least two Business Days before any borrowing date, notify the Company,
and the Banks of each determination of an Offshore Rate, provided that
any failure to do so shall not relieve the Company of any liability
hereunder. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a
change in the Applicable Margin or the Reserve Percentage shall become
effective as of the opening of business on the day on which

26
<PAGE> 33
such change in the Applicable Margin or the Reserve Percentage occurs.
The Company shall inform the Agent immediately if a change in its
Public Debt Rating occurs. The Agent will with reasonable promptness
notify the Company and the Banks of the effective date and the amount
of each such change, provided that any failure to do so shall not
relieve the Company of any liability hereunder.

(c) Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error.

(d) If any Reference Bank's Commitment shall terminate
(otherwise than on termination of all the Commitments), or for any
reason whatsoever the Reference Bank shall cease to be a Bank
hereunder, that Reference Bank shall thereupon cease to be a Reference
Bank and Offshore Rate shall be determined on the basis of the rates
as notified by the remaining Reference Banks.

(e) Each Reference Bank shall use its best efforts to
furnish quotations of rates to the Agent as contemplated hereby. If
any of the Reference Banks shall be unable or otherwise fails to
supply such rates to the Agent upon its request, the rate of interest
shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining
Reference Banks or Reference Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Reference Banks shall promptly notify the Agent of any change in the
Offshore Rate. If there shall only be one Reference Bank remaining,
then the Majority Banks shall select a Bank, acceptable to the Agent
and the Company, to be a Reference Bank, and the Agent shall, by
notice to the Company and the Banks, designate such Bank as a
Reference Bank so that there shall at all times be at least two (2)
Reference Banks; provided that such designated Bank agrees to be a
Reference Bank.

2.11 Payments by the Company.

(a) All payments with respect to Committed Loans
(including prepayments) to be made by the Company on account of
principal, interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall
be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein be made to the Agent for the ratable account
of the Banks at the Agent's Payment Office, in dollars and in
immediately available funds, no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time)
on the date specified herein. The identification of a Fed wire number
shall constitute compliance with this deadline; however, it shall not
relieve the Company of its obligation to make payment if payment is
not actually received, provided that provision of the Fed wire number
in good faith shall not

27
<PAGE> 34
constitute a Default hereunder. The Agent will promptly distribute to
each Bank its Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as
expressly provided herein) of such principal, interest, fees or other
amounts, in like funds as received. Any payment which is received by
the Agent later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) shall be deemed to have
been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day and any
applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

(b) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be
due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the
case may be; subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of
"Interest Period" herein.

(c) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the
Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks
hereunder that the Company will not make such payment in full, the
Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in full to the
Agent on such date and the Agent may (but shall not be so required),
in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If
and to the extent the Company shall not have made such payment in full
to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount
distributed to such Bank, together with interest thereon for each day
from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date
such Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate
as in effect for each such day.

2.12 Payments by the Banks to the Agent.

(a) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a
Bank on the Closing Date or, with respect to each Borrowing after the
Closing Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of any
proposed Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent
for the account of the Company the amount of that Bank's Commitment
Percentage of the Borrowing, the Agent may assume that each Bank has
made such amount available to the Agent on the borrowing date and the
Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Company on such date a corresponding
amount. If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made its full
amount available to the Agent and the Agent in such circumstances has
made available to the Company such amount, that Bank shall on the next
Business Day following the date of such Borrowing make such amount
available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds
Rate for and determined as of each day during such period. A
certificate of the Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to amounts

28
<PAGE> 35
owing under this subsection 2.12(a) shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to
the Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on the date of Borrowing
for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made
available to the Agent on the next Business Day following the date of
such Borrowing, the Agent shall notify the Company of such failure to
fund and, upon demand by the Agent, the Company shall pay such amount
to the Agent for the Agent's account, together with interest thereon
for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per
annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans
comprising such Borrowing.

(b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any date
of Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation
hereunder to make a Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the
Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing.

2.13 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If, other than as expressly
contemplated elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the
Committed Loans made by it any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Commitment
Percentage of payments on account of the Committed Loans obtained by all the
Banks, such Bank shall forthwith (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b)
purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Committed Loans made
by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing
Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall
repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid thereto together with an
amount equal to such paying Bank's Commitment Percentage (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank's required repayment to (ii)
the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or
other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total
amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Bank so purchasing a
participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Company
in the amount of such participation. The Agent will keep records (which shall
be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error), of participations
purchased pursuant to this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Banks
following any such purchases.

or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding,
in the case of each Bank and the Agent, such taxes (including income
taxes or franchise taxes) as are imposed on or measured by each Bank's

Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").

(b) In addition, the Company shall pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made

otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) Subject to subsection 3.01(g), the Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Bank and the Agent for the full
amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section

or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification
shall be made within 30 days from the date the Bank or the Agent makes
written demand therefor.

(d) If the Company shall be required by law to deduct or
withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum

subsection 3.01(g):

(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary
so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.01) and including, in the case of non-U.S.
withholding tax imposed at rates of 5% or greater, any U.S.
tax (including, notwithstanding any exclusion from Taxes in
Section 3.01(a), taxes on net income of the

30
<PAGE> 37
Banks) attributable to such increase to the extent not 
actually offset by a foreign tax credit in the Bank's U.S. 
tax return as determined by the Bank in its sole discretion, 
such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
been made;

(ii) the Company shall make such deductions, and

(iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law.

(e) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the

other than a United States person for United States Federal income tax
purposes) agrees that:

(i) it shall, no later than the Closing Date (or,
in the case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to
Section 10.08 after the Closing Date, the date upon which the
Bank becomes a party hereto) deliver to the Agent (with a copy
to the Company) two accurate and complete signed originals of
Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or any successor thereto
("Form 4224"), or two accurate and complete signed originals
of Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or any successor thereto
("Form 1001"), as appropriate, in each case indicating that
the Bank is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to
receive payments of principal, interest and fees under this
Agreement free from withholding of United States Federal
income tax;

(ii) if at any time the Bank makes any changes
necessitating a new Form, it shall with reasonable promptness
deliver to the Agent (with a copy to the Company) in
replacement for, or in addition to, the forms previously
delivered by it hereunder, two accurate and complete signed
originals of Form 4224; or two accurate and complete signed
originals of Form 1001, as appropriate, in each case
indicating that the Bank is on the date of delivery thereof
entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees
under this Agreement free from withholding of United States
Federal income tax or at a reduced rate of withholding under
an applicable tax treaty;

31
<PAGE> 38
(iii) it shall, before or promptly after the
occurrence of any event (including the passing of time but
excluding any event mentioned in (ii) above) requiring a
change in or renewal of the most recent Form 4224 or Form 1001
previously delivered by such Bank and deliver to the Company
through the Agent two accurate and complete original signed
copies of Form 4224 or Form 1001 in replacement for the forms
previously delivered by the Bank; and

(iv) it shall, promptly upon the Company's
reasonable request to that effect, deliver to the Company such
other forms or similar documentation as may be required from
time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation
in order to establish such Bank's tax status for withholding
purposes.

(v) if such Bank claims exemption from withholding
tax under a United States tax treaty by providing a Form 1001
and such Bank sells or grants a participation of all or part
of its rights under this Agreement, such Bank shall notify the
Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the
beneficial owner under this Agreement. To the extent of this
percentage amount, the Agent shall treat such Bank's Form 1001
as no longer in compliance with this Section 3.01(f). In the
event a Bank claiming exemption from United States withholding
tax by filing Form 4224 with the Agent, sells or grants a
participation in its rights under this Agreement, such Bank
agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with the
withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442
of the Code;

(vi) without limiting or restricting any Bank's
right to increased amounts under Section 3.01(d) from the
Company upon satisfaction of such Bank's obligations under the
provisions of this Section 3.01(f), if such Bank is entitled
to a reduction in the applicable withholding tax, the Agent
may withhold from any interest to such Bank an amount
equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into
account such reduction. If the forms or other documentation
required by subparagraph (i) are not delivered to the Agent,
then the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to the
Bank not providing such forms or other documentation, an
amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax. In
addition, the Agent may also withhold against periodic
payments other than interest payments to the extent United
States withholding tax is not eliminated by obtaining Form
4224 or Form 1001; and

32
<PAGE> 39
(vii) if the IRS or any authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent or
the Company did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to
or for the account of any Bank (because the appropriate form
was not delivered by such Bank, was not properly executed by
such Bank, or because such Bank failed to notify the Agent of
a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from
withholding tax ineffective), such Bank shall indemnify the
Agent and/or the Company, as applicable, fully for all amounts
paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent and/or the Company,
as applicable, as tax or otherwise, including penalties and
interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction
on the amounts payable to the Agent or the Company, as
applicable under this Section 3.01(f), together with all
costs, expenses and Attorneys' Costs.

(g) The Company will not be required to pay any
additional amounts in respect of United States Federal income tax
pursuant to subsection 3.01(d)(i) to any Bank for the account of any
Lending Office of such Bank:

(i) if the obligation to pay such additional
amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Bank
to comply with its obligations under subsection 3.01(f) in
respect of such Lending Office;

(ii) if such Bank shall have delivered to the
Company a Form 4224 in respect of such Lending Office pursuant
to subsection 3.01(f), and such Bank shall not at any time be
entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United
States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the
Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for
any reason other than a change in United States law or
regulations or in the official interpretation of such law or
regulations by any governmental authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not
having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such
Form 4224; or

(iii) if the Bank shall have delivered to the Company
a Form 1001 in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to
Section 3.01(f), and such Bank shall not at any time be
entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United
States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the
Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for
any reason other than a change in United States law or
regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in
the official interpretation of any such law, treaty or
regulations by any governmental authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not
having the

33
<PAGE> 40
force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form 1001.

(h) If, at any time, the Company requests any Bank to
deliver any forms or other documentation pursuant to subsection
3.01(f)(iv), then the Company shall, on demand of such Bank through
the Agent, reimburse such Bank for any costs and expenses (including
Attorney Costs) reasonably incurred by such Bank in the preparation or
delivery of such forms or other documentation.

(i) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts
to any Bank or the Agent pursuant to subsection 3.01(d), then such
Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and
regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending
Office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Company
which may thereafter accrue if such change in the sole judgment of
such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

(j) The agreements and Obligations of the Company
contained in this Section 3.01 shall survive the payment in full of
principal and interest hereunder and termination of the Commitments.

3.02 Illegality.

(a) If any Bank shall determine upon advice of its
counsel, that the introduction of any Requirement of Law or any change
in or in the interpretation or administration thereof has made it
unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has
asserted that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Lending Office to
make Offshore Rate Committed Loans, then, on notice thereof by the
Bank to the Company through the Agent, the obligation of the Bank to
make Offshore Rate Committed Loans shall be suspended until the Bank
shall have notified the Agent and the Company that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exists. During such
period of suspension as to any Bank, any subsequent Committed
Borrowings consisting of Offshore Rate Committed Loans shall include a
Reference Rate Loan rather than Offshore Rate Committed Loan by the
Bank subject to such suspension.

(b) If a Bank shall determine upon advice of its counsel
that it is unlawful to maintain any Offshore Rate Committed Loan, the
Company shall prepay in full all Offshore Rate Committed Loans of the
Bank then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, either
on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if the Bank may
lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Committed Loans to
such day, or immediately, if the Bank may not lawfully continue to
maintain

34
<PAGE> 41
such Offshore Rate Committed Loans, together with any amounts required
to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to Section 3.04.

(c) If the Company is required to prepay any Offshore
Rate Committed Loan immediately as provided in subsection 3.02(b),
then concurrently with such prepayment, the Company shall borrow from
the affected Bank, in the amount of such repayment, a Reference Rate
Committed Loan.

3.03 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. In the event that
any Bank determines that compliance with any United States (including any
state, political subdivision, territory or possession thereof) or foreign law,
regulation, treaty, directive or guideline, currently or hereafter in effect,
or the interpretation or application thereof, or the compliance with any
request, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from
any United States or foreign central bank or any other governmental authority:

(a) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against, or
imposes any other conditions with respect to assets held by, or
deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or
loans by, or other credit or commitment therefor extended by, or any
other acquisition of funds by, any office of any Bank which is not
otherwise included or accounted for in any determination of the
Reference Rate or the Offshore Rate or any interest payable hereunder;
or

(b) affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Bank or any corporation
controlling any such Bank and such Bank determines that the amount of
such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such
Bank's Commitment, or the making, maintaining or funding of such
Bank's Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder;

and the result is to increase (as reasonably determined by such Bank) the cost
to such Bank of (A) agreeing to make, making, funding, renewing or maintaining
its Loans hereunder, or (B) agreeing to maintain, or its maintenance of, its
Commitment hereunder, or to reduce any amount receivable in respect of any of
the foregoing, or to reduce (as determined by such Bank) the rate of return on
such Bank's or such controlling corporation's capital (taking into account the
policies of such Bank or corporation with regard to capital), then, in any such
case, the Company agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Bank,
upon such Bank's demand, any additional amount as may be necessary to
compensate fully such Bank for such additional cost, reduced amount receivable,
or reduced rate of return as reasonably determined by such Bank to place such
Bank in the same economic position as if such

35
<PAGE> 42
compliance had not occurred. Each Bank will promptly notify the Agent, in
writing, of the occurrence of any of the events described in this Section 3.03
and, upon its receipt of such notice, the Agent will promptly notify the
Company thereof, provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to
compensate any Bank for such additional costs or reduced rate of return which
accrue prior to a date which is 45 days before such notice is given. A
certificate as to such amounts in reasonable detail, submitted to the Company
and the Agent by such Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error. Each Bank agrees that, in the determination of any such
amount, such Bank shall use reasonable means of allocation and attribution with
respect to the Loans and Commitment hereunder as among all loans, advances,
commitments and other extensions of credit by such Bank generally.

3.04 Funding Losses. The Company agrees to reimburse each Bank and
to hold each Bank harmless from any loss, cost or expense which the Bank may
sustain or incur as a consequence of:

(a) any failure of the Company to make any payment or
prepayment, after having given notice, of principal of any Offshore
Rate Committed Loan (including payments made after any acceleration
thereof);

(b) any failure of the Company to borrow, continue or
convert a Committed Loan after the Company has given a Notice of
Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation;

(c) any failure of the Company to make any prepayment
after the Company has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.06;

(d) any prepayment of an Offshore Rate Committed Loan on
a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect
thereto; or

(e) the conversion of any Offshore Rate Committed Loan to
a Reference Rate Committed Loan on a day that is not the last day of
the respective Interest Period pursuant to subsection 2.04;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its Offshore Rate Committed Loans hereunder
or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were
obtained.

3.05 Inability to Determine Rates. If two or more Reference Banks
or the Majority Banks shall have reasonably determined that for any reason
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Offshore Rate
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate
Committed Loan or that the Offshore Rate for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a

36
<PAGE> 43
proposed Offshore Rate Committed Loan does not adequately reflect the funding
cost to such Banks of such Loan, the Agent will forthwith give notice of such
determination to the Company and each Bank. Thereafter, the obligation of the
Banks to make Offshore Rate Committed Loans hereunder shall be suspended until
the Agent upon the instruction of the Majority Banks revokes such notice in
writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the
Company does not revoke such notice, the Banks shall make, convert or continue
the Committed Loans, as proposed by the Company, in the amount specified in the
applicable notice submitted by the Company, but such Loans shall be made,
converted or continued as Reference Rate Committed Loans instead of Offshore
Rate Committed Loans.

3.06 Reserves on Offshore Rate Committed Loans. The Company shall
pay to each Bank, as long as such Bank shall be required under regulations of
the Federal Reserve Board to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or
assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently
known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional costs on the unpaid principal
amount of each Offshore Rate Committed Loan equal to actual costs of such
reserves allocated to such Loan by the Bank (as determined by the Bank in good
faith, which determination shall be conclusive), payable on each date on which
interest is payable on such Loan provided the Company shall have received at
least fifteen days' prior written notice (with a copy to the Agent) of such
additional interest from the Bank. If a Bank fails to give notice fifteen days
prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be
payable fifteen days from receipt of such notice.

3.07 Certificates of Banks. Any Bank claiming reimbursement or
compensation pursuant to this Article III shall deliver to the Company (with a
copy to the Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount
payable to the Bank hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and
binding on the Company and in the absence of manifest error.

3.08 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Company in
this Article III shall survive the payment of all other Obligations provided
that, any Bank desiring to make a claim for reimbursement under Section 3.04
shall do so within 180 days after the Termination Date.

3.09 Replacement Banks. If the obligation of any Bank to make
Offshore Rate Committed Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 3.02, the
Company may, with respect to such Bank, elect to terminate this Agreement, and
in connection therewith, not to borrow any Reference Rate Loan provided for in
Section 3.02 , or to repay any Reference Rate Loan made pursuant to Section
3.02; provided, that the Company notifies such Bank through the Agent of such
election at least three Business Days before any date fixed

37
<PAGE> 44
for such a borrowing or such a prepayment, as the case may be, and (i) repays
all of such Bank's outstanding Loans plus all accrued interest, commitment fees
and other amounts owing to, but not including, the date of repayment at the end
of the respective Interest Periods applicable thereto or as otherwise required
by Section 3.02, and (ii) selects, with the consent of the Agent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, an Eligible Assignee which shall assume all the
rights and obligations of such Bank as to which this Agreement has been
terminated. Upon receipt by the Agent of such notice and the assignment to and
assumption of the Commitment by a replacement bank, the Commitment of such Bank
shall terminate.

(b) declare the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all

demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by the Company; and

(c) exercise on behalf of itself and the Banks all rights
and remedies available to it and the Banks under the Loan Documents or
applicable law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any event specified in paragraph

expiration of the 60-day period mentioned therein), the obligation of each Bank
to make Loans shall automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of

ARTICLE IX
THE AGENT

9.01 Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints, designates and authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it
by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agent.

9.02 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees
or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

9.03 Liability of Agent. None of the Agent, its Affiliates, or any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or
attorneys-in-fact (collectively, the "Agent-Related Persons") shall (i) be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner
to any of the Banks for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made
by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, or any officer
thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
for any failure of the Company or any other party to any Loan Document to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall
be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the Properties,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

64
<PAGE> 71
9.04 Reliance by Agent.

(a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or
telephone message, statement or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
discretionary action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Majority Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against
any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance
with a request or consent of the Majority Banks or the Banks, as the
case may be, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Banks.

(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the
conditions specified in Sections 4.01 and 4.02, each Bank that has
executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved
or accepted or to be satisfied with each document or other matter
required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
satisfactory to the Bank, unless an officer of the Agent responsible
for the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents shall have
received notice from the Bank prior to the initial Borrowing
specifying its objection thereto and either such objection shall not
have been withdrawn by notice to the Agent to that effect or the Bank
shall not have made available to the Agent the Bank's ratable portion
of such Committed Borrowing.

9.05 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees
required to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent
shall have received written notice from a Bank, the Company referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. The Agent
shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
shall be requested by the Majority Banks in accordance with Article VIII;
provided, however,

65
<PAGE> 72
that unless and until the Agent shall have received any such request, the Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking
such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Banks.

9.06 Credit Decision. Each Bank expressly acknowledges that none
of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it and
that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to
the Agent and the Arranger that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or the Arranger and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated thereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and extend credit to the Company
hereunder. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished
to the Banks by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility
to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession of any of
the Agent-Related Persons.

9.07 Indemnification. The Banks shall indemnify upon demand the
Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the
Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any
kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the
repayment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such
Person any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by any such
Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, however,
that no Bank shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of
any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,

66
<PAGE> 73
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely
from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation
of the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs)
incurred by the Agent in connection with the administration, modification,
amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or
otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under,
this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or
referred to herein to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such
expenses by or on behalf of the Company. The obligation of the Banks in this
Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder.

9.08 Agent in Individual Capacity. BofA and its Affiliates may
make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits
from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust, financial advisory or other business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though BofA were not the Agent hereunder and
without notice to the Banks. With respect to its Loans, BofA shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks"
shall include BofA in its individual capacity. BofA acts in the capacity of
Agent under the Existing Credit Agreement.

9.09 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days'
notice to the Banks or the Agent, respectively. If the Agent shall resign as
Agent under this Agreement, the Majority Banks, after consultation with the
Company, shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks.
If no successor Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the
resignation of the Agent, the Agent shall appoint, after consulting with the
Banks and the Company, a successor agent from among the Banks. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor
agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent
and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agent's
rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring
Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and
Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

9.10 The Arranger. The Arranger shall have no right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than
the right to receive the fees referred to in Section 2.09(b) and the right to
indemnity under Section 10.05.

10.01 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no
consent with respect to any departure by the Company therefrom, shall be

Majority Banks, and acknowledged in writing by the Agent, and then such waiver
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent

any Bank to any additional obligations (except pursuant to Section

(f) release any guaranty or pledge agreement 
delivered pursuant to Section 6.11 except as otherwise contemplated

writing and consented to and signed by the Agent in addition to the Majority
Banks or all the Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of the
Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

10.02 Notices.

(a) All notices, requests and other communications 
provided for hereunder except as specifically provided otherwise 
herein, shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly
otherwise provides, telegraphic, telex, facsimile transmission or 
cable communication) and telegraphed, telexed or delivered, (i) if 
to the Company, to its address specified

68
<PAGE> 75
on the signature pages hereof, (ii) if to any Bank, to its Domestic 
Lending Office, and (iii) if to the Agent, to its address specified on 
the signature pages hereof; or, as to the Company or the Agent, to

notice to the other parties, and as to each other party, at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the
Company and the Agent.

(b) All such notices and communications shall, when 
transmitted by overnight delivery, telegraphed, by facsimile, telexed 
or cabled, be effective when delivered for overnight delivery or to

answerback or delivered to the cable company, respectively, or if

or VIII shall not be effective until actually received by the Agent or 
the Banks as specified herein.

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any agreement 
of the Agent and the Banks at Article II herein to receive certain 
notices by telephone and facsimile is solely for the convenience
and at the request of the Company. The Agent and the Banks shall be 
entitled to rely on the authority of any Person purporting to be a 
Person authorized by the Company to give such notice and the Agent and 
the Banks shall not have any liability to the Company or other Person 
on account of any action taken or not taken by the Agent and the Banks 
in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The obligation 
of the Company to repay the Loans shall not be affected in any way or 
to any extent by any failure by the Agent and the Banks to receive 
written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the 
receipt by the Agent and the Banks of a confirmation which is at
variance with the terms understood by the Agent and the Banks to be 
contained in the telephonic or facsimile notice.

10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure
to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank,
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

10.04 Costs and Expenses. The Company shall, whether or not the 
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated:

(a) pay or reimburse the Agent and the Arranger on 
demand for all costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection 
with the development, preparation, delivery, and execution of and any 
amendment, supplement, waiver or modifica-

69
<PAGE> 76
tion to, this Agreement, any Loan Document and any 
other documents prepared in connection herewith or 
therewith, and the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Attorney 
Costs incurred by the Agent and the Arranger with 
respect thereto; 

(b) pay or reimburse each Bank and the 
Agent on demand for all costs and expenses incurred by 
them in connection with the enforcement, attempted 
enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies 
(including in connection with any "workout" or 
restructuring regarding the Loans) under this 
Agreement, any other Loan Document, and any such other 
documents, including Attorney Costs incurred by the 
Agent and any Bank; and 

(c) pay or reimburse the Agent on 
demand for all appraisal (including the allocated cost 
of internal appraisal services), audit, environmental 
inspection and review (including the allocated cost of 
such internal services), search and filing costs, fees 
and expenses, incurred or sustained by the Agent in 
connection with the matters referred to under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section. 

10.05 Indemnity. The Company shall pay, indemnify, and 
hold each Bank, the Agent, the Arranger and each of their respective officers, 
directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an 
"Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, 
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, 
charges, expenses or disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or 
nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, 
performance and administration of this Agreement and any other Loan Documents, 
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and with respect to any
investigation, litigation or proceeding related to this Agreement or the Loans
or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified Person is a
party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities");
provided, that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities arising from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The
agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other Obligations.

10.06 Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither
the Agent nor the Banks shall be under any obligation to marshall any assets in
favor of the Company or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all
of the Obligations. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments
to the Agent or the Banks, or the Agent or the Banks exercise their rights of
set-off, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or
set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party in connection with any Insolvency

70
<PAGE> 77
Proceeding, or otherwise, then to the extent of such recovery the obligation or
part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued
in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such
enforcement or set-off had not occurred.

10.07 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement 
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their 
respective successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign or 
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the 
prior written consent of the Agent and each Bank.

10.08 Assignments, Participations, Confidentiality, etc.

(a) Any Bank may, with the written consent of the 
Company (which will not be unreasonably withheld) and the Agent 
(which will not be unreasonably withheld), at any time assign and 
delegate to one or more Eligible Assignees (provided that no written
consent of the Company or the Agent shall be required in connection 
with any assignment and delegation by a Bank to a Bank Affiliate of 
such Bank) (each an "Assignee") all, or any ratable part of all, of 
the Loans, the Commitments and the other rights and obligations of 
such Bank hereunder, in a minimum amount of $10,000,000; provided, 
however, that (i) the Company and the Agent may continue to deal 
solely and directly with such Bank in connection with the interest
so assigned to an Assignee until (A) written notice of such 
assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses and related 
information with respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to 
the Company and the Agent by such Bank and the Assignee; and (B) such 
Bank and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Company and the 
Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit N 
("Assignment and Acceptance").

(b) From and after the date that the Agent notifies 
the assignor Bank that it has received an executed Assignment and 
Acceptance and payment of a recordation fee of $2,500, (i) the 
Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that 
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to 
such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations 
a Bank under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Bank shall, to 
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned 
by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its 
rights and be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents.

(c) Immediately upon each Assignee's making its 
payment under the Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement, shall 
be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, 
necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the

71
<PAGE> 78
resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The Commitment 
allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Bank 
pro tanto.

(d) Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more commercial 
banks (a "Participant") participating interests in any Loans, the Commitment of
that Bank and the other interests of that Bank (the "originating Bank") 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i) the 
originating Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, 
(ii) the originating Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance 
of such obligations, (iii) the Company, and the Agent shall continue to deal 
solely and directly with the originating Bank in connection with the originating
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents, and (iv) no Bank shall transfer or grant any participating interest 
under which the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to, or 
any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document, except to the extent such amendment, consent or waiver would require 
unanimous consent as described in the first proviso to Section 10.01. In the 
case of any such participation, the Participant shall not have any rights 
under this Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, and all amounts 
payable by the Company hereunder shall be determined as if such Bank had not
sold such participation; except that, if amounts outstanding under this 
Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become 
due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant 
shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating 
interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the 
amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Bank under 
this Agreement.

(e) Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions 
and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all non-public 
information provided to it by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or 
by the Agent on such Company's or Subsidiary's behalf, in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates
shall use any such information for any purpose or in any manner other than
pursuant to the terms contemplated by this Agreement; except to the extent such
information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by the Bank, or (ii) was or becomes available on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided that such
source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or subject
to a fiduciary duty to the Company or its stockholders; provided further,
however, that any Bank may disclose such information (A) at the request or
pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which the Bank is
subject or in

72
<PAGE> 79
connection with an examination of such Bank by any such
authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or other court process, provided
that the Bank will promptly notify the Company of any such process and
shall make only such disclosures as such Bank's legal counsel advises
are required; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; and (D) to such
Bank's independent auditors and other professional advisors. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company authorizes each Bank to
disclose to any Participant or Assignee (each, a "Transferee") and to
any prospective Transferee, such financial and other information in
such Bank's possession concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
which has been delivered to Agent or the Banks pursuant to this
Agreement or which has been delivered to the Agent or the Banks by the
Company in connection with the Banks' credit evaluation of the Company
prior to entering into this Agreement; provided that, unless otherwise
agreed by the Company, such Transferee agrees in writing to such Bank
to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of
the Banks hereunder and such Bank agrees to provide the Company with a
copy of the confidentiality agreement executed in connection
therewith.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provisios contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, any Bank may
assign all or any portion of the Loans or Notes held by it to any
Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral
security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such
Federal Reserve Bank, provided that any payment in respect of such
assigned Loans or Notes made by the Company to or for the account of
the assigning and/or pledging Bank in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall satisfy the Company's obligations hereunder in
respect to such assigned Loans or Notes to the extent of such payment. 
No such assignment shall release the assigning Bank from its
obligations hereunder.

(g) Any Bank may request the Agent to obtain from the 
Company a promissory note evidencing the Company's Indebtedness to it
hereunder for the purpose of pledging such note to a Federal Reserve
Bank located outside the State of Florida.

10.09 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists, each Bank is authorized at any
time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Company, any such
notice being waived by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time
owing to, such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Company against
any and all Obligations owing to such Bank, now or

73

<PAGE> 80
hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or such Bank shall
have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such
Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to
notify the Company and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by
such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Bank
under this Section 10.09 are in addition to the other rights and remedies
(including other rights of set-off) which the Bank may have.

10.10 Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc. Each 
Bank shall notify the Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which 
notices to the Bank should be directed, of addresses of its Offshore Lending 
Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it 
hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Agent shall
reasonably request.

10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or
more of the parties to this Agreement in any number of separate counterparts,
each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, and all of said
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute but one and the same
instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties
shall be lodged with the Company and the Agent.

10.12 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability of any 
provision of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder 
shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the 
remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required 
hereunder.

10.13 No Third Parties Benefited. This Agreement is made and 
entered into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the 
Banks and the Agent, and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other 
Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct 
or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any 
of the other Loan Documents. Neither the Agent nor any Bank shall have any 
obligation to any Person not a party to this Agreement or other Loan Documents.

10.14 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND 
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED THAT 
THE AGENT AND THE BANKS SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

10.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE COMPANY, THE GUARANTORS, THE 
BANKS AND THE AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF 
ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS 
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE

74
<PAGE> 81
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER
LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR
PARTIES, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE.
THE COMPANY, THE GUARANTORS, THE BANKS AND THE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY
ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO
CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

10.16 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other
Loan Documents, embodies the entire Agreement and understanding among the
Company, the Banks and the Agent, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
Agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof, except for the fee letters referenced in
subsection 2.09(b), and any prior arrangements made with respect to the payment
by the Company of (or any indemnification for) any fees, costs or expenses
payable to or incurred (or to be incurred) by or on behalf of the Agent or the
Banks.

Agreement to be duly executed and delivered in New York City by their proper
