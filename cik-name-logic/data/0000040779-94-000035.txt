ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As has been previously reported, in March 1993, the

Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ("PaPUC") amended a

January 1993 rate order and allowed Metropolitan Edison Company

("Met-Ed") to collect revenues it had requested for certain

decommissioning costs associated with Three Mile Island Unit No.

2 ("TMI - 2"). In May 1993, the Pennsylvania Office of Consumer

Advocate filed a petition for review with the Pennsylvania

Commonwealth Court seeking to set aside the portion of the

PaPUC's amended rate order which allowed Met-Ed to recover TMI-2

decommissioning costs.

On July 11, 1994, the Commonwealth Court reversed the

PaPUC's amended rate order. Met-Ed intends to seek a review of

the Commonwealth Court decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme

Court.

As a result of the Commonwealth Court decision, Met-Ed

and Pennsylvania Electric Company ("Penelec") intend to write

off, in the second quarter of 1994, their allocable share (based

on their 50% and 25% respective TMI-2 ownership interests) of

estimated TMI-2 decommissioning costs. At December 31, 1993,

such amount totalled approximately $171 million (before taxes),

based on the funding target established by the Nuclear Regulatory

Commission which target is subject to future adjustment.

Management is continuing to review these amounts, but presently

expects that the write off will be approximately $171 million.

GPU's other electric operating subsidiary, Jersey Central Power &

1
<PAGE>

Light Company, which owns the remaining 25% interest in TMI-2,

has been permitted by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to

recover its share of the estimated TMI-2 decommissioning costs

from its customers and is not affected by the Commonwealth Court

decision.

GPU has previously announced that it will incur a

substantial charge to income in 1994 of between $110 and $120

million due to its Voluntary Enhanced Retirement Program and

that, as a result of another Commonwealth Court decision

involving a nonaffiliated utility, Penelec may be required to

write off an estimated $14 million of post-retirement benefit

costs.

Unless the Commonwealth Court decisions are overturned,

the effect of these developments, particularly upon Met-Ed, will

severely restrict the ability of GPU's Pennsylvania utility

subsidiaries to issue senior securities, and GPU is therefore

reviewing their 1994-95 operation and construction plans.

There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these

matters.

A copy of GPU's related news release is annexed as an

exhibit.

GPU REACTS TO PENNSYLVANIA COURT DECISION

Parsippany, N.J. -- General Public Utilities Corporation

(NYSE:GPU) is reviewing an order by the Pennsylvania Commonwealth

Court that reverses a 1993 Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission

order allowing GPU's Metropolitan Edison Company subsidiary to

collect decommissioning costs of Three Mile Island Unit 2.

"We are very disappointed by today's order," said James R.

Leva, GPU chairman, president and chief executive officer. "As

we said earlier this year, we will incur a substantial charge of

between $110 and $120 million to income this year for our

Voluntary Enhanced Retirement Program. In addition, we may see

an impact, as a result of another Commonwealth Court decision

involving a nonaffiliated utility, on Pennsylvania Electric

Company, which may be required to write off an estimated $14

million of post-retirement benefit costs.

"If these court decisions are not overturned, the effect of

these three developments, particularly upon Met-Ed, will severely

restrict the ability of our Pennsylvania subsidiaries to issue

senior securities. As a result, we will be reviewing their

spending plans for operations and construction for this year and

next. We are studying all of these issues now," Leva said.

The original PaPUC decision in the TMI-2 case, which was

issued in January 1993, disallowed these decommissioning costs.

At that time, GPU announced a pre-tax charge to income of

approximately $171 million, allocated two-thirds to Met-Ed and

one-third to Penelec, reflecting their 50 percent and 25 percent

respective ownership interests in TMI-2. This charge to income

was cancelled when the PaPUC reversed its prior order in March

1993. It was that order which was overturned by the Court today.

Jersey Central has been permitted by the N.J. Board of

Public Utilities to recover its share of the estimated TMI-2

decommissioning costs from its customers. Jersey Central is not

affected by these actions today.

Met-Ed has not decided whether to appeal today's

Commonwealth Court ruling.

"We are studying it carefully to determine our next course

of action," Leva said.
