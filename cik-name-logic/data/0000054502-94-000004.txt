K N ENERGY SUBSIDIARIES COMPLETE ACQUISITION OF GAS RESERVES 

Lakewood, CO - K N Energy, Inc. (NYSE - KNE) today announced that
K N's gas reserves development subsidiaries, K N Production
Company and GASCO, Inc., have finalized the previously disclosed
acquisition of a substantial portion of the gas reserves and
production of Fuel Resources Development Co. (Fuelco), a
subsidiary of Public Service Co. of Colorado.

This acquisition further positions K N Energy to benefit from
development of natural gas reserves and related gas gathering and
processing in the Rocky Mountain region and is an additional step
in the Company's strategic growth focus on natural gas business
opportunities. 

The properties are located near existing K N operations in
western Colorado and in the Moxa Arch region of southwestern
Wyoming, both prolific natural gas areas. Total net reserves are
approximately 50 billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas,
approximately 90 percent of which is gas. No purchase price has
been disclosed.

K N Energy, with operations in seven states, supplies natural gas
to residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural customers
through three pipeline systems. Principal operations serve over
340 communities and 230,000 direct customers in Colorado, Kansas,
Nebraska and Wyoming. Operating one of the 10 longest natural
gas pipeline systems in the United States, K N Energy has annual
sales exceeding $470 million and assets of approximately $640
million.
