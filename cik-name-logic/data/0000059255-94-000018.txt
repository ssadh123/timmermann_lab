VALHI'S EARNINGS CONTINUE TO IMPROVE

DALLAS, TEXAS . . October 26, 1994 . . Valhi, Inc. (NYSE:VHI) reported net
income of $4.6 million, or $.04 per share, for the third quarter of 1994
compared to a net loss of $2.0 million, or $.02 per share, in the comparable
1993 period. For the nine month year-to-date period, net income was $6.9
million, or $.06 per share, $76 million better than the net loss of $69.4
million, or $.61 per share, for 1993. Improved results attributable to the
Company's interest in NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL) were a major factor in the
higher 1994 earnings. NL's chemicals operations improved through higher prices
for titanium dioxide pigments, higher sales volume and lower operating costs.

Valhi's third quarter sales were up 9%, to $233 million, in large part due
to higher refined sugar volumes in conjunction with the end of the sugar crop
year. Operating income of $26.1 million for the third quarter was slightly
lower than last year's $27.0 million as improved forest products earnings,
enhanced by higher average selling prices for medium density fiberboard, were
more than offset by comparative refined sugar LIFO adjustments. In the nine-
month period, operating income was up 13%, to $73.3 million, on a 9% increase in
sales, to $633 million, as prices and volumes were generally higher than in
1993.

Lower average debt and rates resulted in reduced interest expense during
1994. The extraordinary item in 1993 relates to premiums associated with the
prepayment of high-cost subordinated debt. Tremont Corporation's (NYSE: TRE)
titanium metal operations were negatively affected by recently settled strikes
at its two major facilities.

As previously announced, the Company has agreed to sell its sugar business
to an agricultural cooperative of sugarbeet growers for $325 million cash. The
transaction is subject to financing and other conditions and there can be no
assurance that it will be consummated.

Valhi, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is engaged in the refined
sugar, forest products, hardware products and fast food industries as well as
the chemicals and titanium metals industries through its interests in NL
Industries and Tremont Corporation.
