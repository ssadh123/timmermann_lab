AT&T AND SUBSIDIARIES AND McCAW AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Note 1 - McCaw Historical Presentation 

Certain amounts reported in McCaw's historical financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the AT&T presentations in the
accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet and Statements of
Income. Such reclassifications are not material to the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements. 

Note 2 - Exchange Ratio

As defined in the Merger Agreement, the Exchange Ratio will be one
AT&T Common Share for each share of McCaw Common Stock; provided, however,
that (i) in the event the Closing Date Market Price of one AT&T Common
Share (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) is less than
$53.00, the Exchange Ratio will be equal to $53.00 divided by the Closing
Date Market Price of one AT&T Common Share, but in no event greater than
1.111 AT&T Common Shares, and (ii) in the event the Closing Date Market
Price of one AT&T Common Share is greater than $71.73, the Exchange Ratio
will be equal to $71.73 divided by the Closing Date Market Price of one
AT&T Common Share, but in no event less than .909 of an AT&T Common Share. 
For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, an
Exchange Ratio of one AT&T Common Share per share of McCaw Common Stock (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) is assumed. 

Note 3 - Other Pro Forma Adjustments

(A) The McCaw Common Stock account has been adjusted to reflect the
assumed exchange of one AT&T Common Share, par value $1.00 per share, for
each of approximately 194.6 million shares of McCaw Common Stock, par value
$.01 per share, outstanding at March 31, 1994 (excluding shares of McCaw
Common Stock held by AT&T - see Note 3(B)). The difference between the par
value of the AT&T Common Shares and the par value of the McCaw Common
Stock, after giving effect to the assumed Exchange Ratio, is reflected as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital of $193.

(B) The $400 investment by AT&T in 14.5 million shares of Class A
Common Stock purchased in February 1993 has been eliminated. The weighted
average common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 1993
and March 31, 1994 have been adjusted to eliminate the impact of this
investment.

(C) McCaw's historical financial statements reflect the adoption of
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," retroactive to January 1,
1991. AT&T adopted SFAS No. 109 effective January 1, 1993. For conformity
purposes, the pro forma combined information for AT&T and McCaw has been
adjusted as if McCaw had adopted SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 1993. Such
adoption would result in the use of different tax assumptions related to
intangible assets McCaw acquired in purchase business combinations in 1991
and 1992 that would increase the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109
by $39. Accordingly, the pro forma combined net income and earnings per 

8
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Form 8-K/A#4 AT&T Corp.
August 16, 1993

common share have been decreased $1,840 and $1.20 for the period ended
March 31, 1993, respectively. Pro forma combined total assets and
shareowners' equity have been decreased $39 at March 31, 1994. Also,
effective January 1, 1993, AT&T adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." McCaw adopted SFAS No. 112
effective January 1, 1994. The impact of this standard on McCaw's
financial statements is immaterial. 

(D) No adjustments have been reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements for direct expenses related to the Merger. 
Direct expenses included in the historical periods presented have not been
adjusted for in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements. 
Such amounts are not material. 

(E) No adjustments to eliminate intercompany transactions and balances
have been made in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements as
such amounts are not material. 

(F) The cash dividends per common share in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements reflect AT&T's cash dividends declared in the
periods presented. McCaw has never paid cash dividends on the McCaw Common
Stock.

Note 4 - Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements assume that the
Merger qualifies as a "tax-free" reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.
