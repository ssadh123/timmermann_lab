ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On July 1, 1994, Charter Bancshares, Inc. ("Charter") consummated
the acquisition of residential construction loans and selected fixed assets
from Roosevelt Financial Group, Chesterfield, Missouri. The residential
construction loans represented the existing construction portfolio
generated by the construction lending operations of Farm and Home Savings
Association ("Farm and Home") prior to the June 30, 1994 acquisition of
Farm and Home by Roosevelt Financial Group. In addition to purchasing these
construction loans and selected fixed assets, Charter will employ
approximately 20 persons previously employed by Farm and Home and
associated with the construction lending area. The loans and selected fixed
assets were purchased by Charter National Bank-Houston, a wholly-owned
national bank subsidiary of Charter.

The purchased residential construction loans represent approximately
$75 million in outstanding balances, with total credit lines of
approximately $210 million. Approximately one-third of the outstanding
loans are for home construction in Houston, one-third in Dallas, and the
balance are for homes in Austin and San Antonio. A typical interim
construction loan will have an average life of less than one year and earn
interest that floats at prime rate plus one to one and one-half percent
(the prime rate as of July 1, 1994 was 7.25%). Additional fees may be
earned on construction loans in the form of origination fees, inspection
fees, appraisal fees, and extension fees. The purchased fixed assets of
approximately $267,000 are primarily comprised of the furniture and
equipment used in Farm and Home's construction lending area. Except for
approximately $11,000 in miscellaneous accounts payable related to
construction loans, there were no other liabilities assumed by Charter in
the transaction. All of the loans and selected fixed assets were purchased
at the existing net book values as reflected on Roosevelt Financial Group's
books, which amounts approximate their fair value. No purchase premium or
discount was paid to or received from Roosevelt Financial Group.

A portion of the purchase price was financed by $38 million in
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. The remaining
purchase price was funded through the utilization of existing liquid assets
in the form of federal funds sold and short-term investments.

This acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The following pro forma financial information consists of a pro
forma condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 1994. Pro forma adjustments
related to the pro forma condensed balance sheet have been computed
assuming the acquisition was consummated March 31, 1994. Pro forma
condensed statements of operations are not presented since this transaction
is not considered an acquisition of a continuing business. This acquisition
is a purchase of short-lived assets at amounts considered to be their fair
value.
