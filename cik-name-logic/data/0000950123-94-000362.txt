Item 5. Other Events

On February 7, 1994, the smaller of the two potassium nitrate
production units located in the Company's Haifa, Israel manufacturing facility
was damaged by an accidental fire. Such damage will result in a temporary
reduction of the Company's potassium nitrate production capacity.

The Company is currently reviewing various alternatives
concerning the most effective and timely replacement of the damaged production
unit and expects to replace the damaged unit within approximately twelve
months. The Company believes that the loss, including the effect of business
interruption, will be substantially covered by insurance.
