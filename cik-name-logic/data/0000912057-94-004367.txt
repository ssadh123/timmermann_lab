terms and provisions as are necessary to comply with all applicable securities
laws, including, in the case of an indenture, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company will provide the
Required Holders with all such documents and information, financial or
otherwise, assist in all such due diligence and

do such other things and enter into such other agreements as are necessary or,
in the judgment of the Required Holders, desirable to resell the Debentures and

unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the Company shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and
the Holders on the other from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. If, however, the allocation provided by
the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law,
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with
the actions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on
the one hand and the Holders on the other hand shall be deemed to be in
the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the Debentures (before
deducting expenses) received by the Debentures bear to the net fees paid
in accordance with Section 3.01(g) and retained by the indemnified
Holders. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the action of the Company on the one hand or the
Holders on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (iv) were
determined by any method of allocation which does not

-48-
<PAGE>

take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this
subsection (iv). The amounts paid or payable by an indemnified party as a
result of the losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (iv) shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim, as the same are incurred. The Company's and the Holders'
obligations in this subsection (iv) to contribute are several and not
joint.

Neither Whitehall nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall
be liable to the Company for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or
any of them under or in connection with any Loan Document, except for gross
negligence or willful misconduct attributable to such Person.

9.05. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. Any provision of this
Agreement, the Debentures, the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust
Agreement or the Letter Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Company and the Required
Holders and SARs; PROVIDED, that no such amendment, waiver or modification
shall, unless signed by all the Holders and holders of then outstanding Stock
Appreciation Rights (i) subject any Holder to any additional obligation, (ii)
reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Debenture or any fees
hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or
interest on any Debenture or any fees hereunder, (iv) change the percentage of
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Debentures, or the number of
Holders, and if applicable, holders of Stock Appreciation Rights, which shall be
required for the Holders, and if applicable, holders of Stock Appreciation
Rights or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.05 or any other
provision of this Agreement, (v) release all or substantially all of the
collateral for the Debentures or (vi) amend or waive the provisions of Section
6.12 or this Section 9.05.

9.06. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account
for more than one such counterpart.

including, without limitation, in Section 9.04, shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the issuance of the Debentures, and the payment of
principal of the Debentures and other obligations hereunder.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Security

JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

unenforceable provisions.

received by the Trustee from the Requisite Lenders pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or

Required Lenders to the extent that all actions the Trustee has taken to
exercise any remedy with respect to the Collateral may be reversed or modified
as so directed without undue difficulty.

any of the Security Documents or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity
or by statute.

(b) No delay or omission of the Trustee to exercise any right,
remedy or power accruing upon any Actionable Default shall impair any such
right, remedy or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof or an
acquiescence therein; and every right, power and remedy given by this Agreement
or any Security Document to the Trustee may be exercised from time to time and
as often as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee.

(c) In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any
right, remedy or power under this Agreement or any Security Document and the
proceeding for the enforcement thereof shall have been discontinued or abandoned
for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and
in every such case the Borrower, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to
any effect of or determination in such proceeding, severally and respectively be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and under such Security
Document with respect to the Trust Estate and in all other respects, and
thereafter all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee shall continue as
though no such proceeding had been taken.

(d) All rights of action and rights to assert claims upon or under
this Agreement and the Security Documents may be enforced by the Trustee without
the possession of any Debt Instrument or the production thereof in any trial or
other proceeding relative thereto.

vendees, assignees and lienors, expressly waives and releases any, every and all
rights to demand or to have any marshalling of the Trust Estate upon any sale,
whether made under any power of sale granted hereunder or under the Security
Documents, or pursuant to judicial proceedings or upon any foreclosure or any
enforcement of this Agreement or the Security Documents and consents and agrees

Section 2.9. BORROWER'S AND TRUSTEE'S RIGHTS AS TO COLLATERAL;

shall have been withdrawn in accordance with the provisions hereof), the
Borrower shall be entitled to exercise all rights, powers, privileges and
remedies in respect of the Collateral, in each case free and clear of any liens
or encumbrance arising out of this Agreement, notwithstanding the grant of
security provided for in this Agreement, subject, however, to the provisions of
Section 3.1. After receipt by the Trustee of a Notice of Actionable Default and
prior to withdrawal of such Notice in accordance with the provisions hereof, the

remedies of the Borrower in respect of the Collateral, including, without
limitation, all rights, powers, privileges and remedies afforded to the Borrower

the Holders as to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the
possession or control of any agent or nominee of it or any income thereon or as
to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights
pertaining thereto. To the extent, however, that the Trustee or an agent or
nominee of the Trustee maintains possession or control of any of the Collateral
or the Security Documents, the Trustee shall, or shall instruct such agent or
nominee to, grant the Borrower the access to such Collateral or Security
Documents which the Borrower requires for the conduct of its business so long as
the Trustee shall not have received a Notice of Actionable Default.

Section 2.10. LIMITATION BY LAW. All the provisions of this
Section 2 are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of
law which may be controlling in the premises and to be limited to the extent
necessary so that they will not render this Agreement invalid or unenforceable
in whole or in part.

Section 2.11. ABSOLUTE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any Security Document, the
right of each Holder, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payments

otherwise exercise any right (other than the right to enforce the security
interest in and lien on the Collateral, which shall in all circumstances be
exercisable only by the Trustee) it may have in connection with, a case under
the Bankruptcy Code in which the Borrower is a debtor, or the obligation of the
Borrower, which is also absolute and unconditional, to pay the Secured Debt
owing by the Borrower to each Holder at the time and place expressed therein
shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

Section 2.12. EQUAL AND RATABLE SECURITY. This Agreement and the
Security Documents are intended to secure the unpaid principal of and accrued
interest and premium, if any, on the Public Debt, together with all expenses,

with all other indebtedness secured under this Agreement and the Security
Documents to the extent required by the Public Indenture, and shall be construed
and enforced to give effect to such intention.

attorneys-in-fact negligence or willful misconduct as and to the extent the
Trustee would be liable for such losses or damages if the actions or omissions
of such agents, nominees or attorneys-in-fact constituting such negligence or
willful misconduct had been actions or omissions of the Trustee. The Trustee
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents,
nominees or attorneys-in-fact selected by it without negligence or willful
misconduct.

necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established with respect to
the Borrower in connection with the taking, suffering or omitting of any action
hereunder by the Trustee, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof
be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided or
established by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower delivered
to the Trustee and such certificate shall be full warranty to the Trustee for
any action taken, suffered or omitted in reliance thereon; subject, however, to
the provisions of Section 5.5.

conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the
opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the
Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement or any Security
Document.

of the rights or powers vested in the Trustee by this Agreement or any Security

Lenders to initiate, the exercise of any remedy with respect to the Collateral,
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement or by any
Security Document, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,
as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
his own affairs, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein
or in any Security Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall
follow written instructions of the Required Lenders, if any are received, as to
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any right or remedy
available to the Trustee, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee, or for the appointment of a receiver, or for the taking of any other

the Trustee under or pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or any Security

Corporate Trustee or the Individual Trustee may at any time, by giving thirty
(30) days' prior written notice to the Borrower, the New Private Lenders, any
New Trustee and the Public Trustee, resign and be discharged of the
responsibilities hereby created, such resignation to become effective upon the
appointment of a successor trustee or trustees by the Borrower and the
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee or trustees. The
Corporate Trustee or the Individual Trustee may be removed at any time and a
successor trustee appointed by the affirmative vote of the Majority Holders;
PROVIDED THAT the Corporate Trustee and the Individual Trustee shall be
entitled to its or his fees and expenses to the date of removal. If no
successor trustee or trustees shall be appointed and approved within thirty (30)
days from the date of the giving of the aforesaid notice of resignation or
within thirty (30) days from the date of such removal, the Corporate Trustee or
the Individual Trustee, as applicable, shall, or any Holder may, apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee or trustees
(which may be an individual or individuals) to act until such time, if any, as a
successor trustee or trustees shall have been appointed as above provided. Any
successor trustee or trustees so appointed by such court shall immediately and
without further act be superseded by any successor trustee or trustees approved
by the Majority Holders as above provided.

(b) If at any time the Corporate Trustee or the Individual Trustee
shall resign, be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, or if at any
time a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Corporate Trustee or the
Individual Trustee for any other cause, a successor trustee or trustees may be
appointed by the Borrower, and the powers, duties, authority and title of the
predecessor trustee or trustees terminated and cancelled without procuring the
resignation of such predecessor trustee or trustees, and without any other
formality (except as may be required by applicable law) than the appointment and
designation of a successor trustee or trustees in writing, duly acknowledged,
delivered to the predecessor trustee or trustees and the Borrower, and filed for
record in each public office, if any, in which this Agreement is required to be
filed.

(c) The appointment and designation referred to in Section 5.7(b)
of this Agreement shall, after any required filing, be full evidence of the
right and authority to make the same and of all the facts therein recited, and
this Agreement shall vest in such successor or trustee or trustees, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, all of the estate and title of its predecessor
or their predecessors, and upon such filing for record the successor trustee or
trustees shall become fully vested with all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, trusts, duties,

<PAGE>

23

authority and title of its predecessor or their predecessors; but such
predecessor or predecessors shall, nevertheless, on the written request of the
Majority Holders, the Borrower, or its or their successor trustee or trustees,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor or successors
all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties, authority and title
of such predecessor or predecessors hereunder and shall deliver all securities
and moneys held by it or them to such successor trustee or trustees. Should any
deed, conveyance or other instrument in writing from the Borrower be required by
any successor trustee or trustees for more fully and certainly vesting in such
successor trustee or trustees the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts,
duties, authority and title vested or intended to be vested in the predecessor
trustee or trustees, any and all such deeds, conveyances and other instruments
in writing shall, on request of such successor trustee or trustees, be so
executed, acknowledged and delivered.

(d) Any required filing for record of the instrument appointing a
successor trustee or trustees as hereinabove provided shall be at the expense of
the Borrower. The resignation of any trustee or trustees and the instrument or
instruments removing any trustee or trustees, together with all other
instruments, deeds and conveyances provided for in this Section 5 shall, if
required by law, be forthwith recorded, registered and filed by and at the
expense of the Borrower, wherever this Agreement is recorded, registered and
filed.

Section 5.8. STATUS OF SUCCESSORS TO THE CORPORATE TRUSTEE.

this Agreement and every corporation resulting from a merger or consolidation
pursuant to Section 5.9 of this Agreement shall be a bank or trust company in
good standing and having power so to act, incorporated under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and having its
principal corporate trust office within the forty-eight (48) contiguous States,
and shall also have capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$100,000,000.

Section 5.9. MERGER OF THE CORPORATE TRUSTEE. Any corporation
into which the Corporate Trustee shall be merged, or with which it shall be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which the Corporate Trustee shall be a party, shall be the Corporate Trustee
under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the parties hereto.

Section 5.10. ADDITIONAL CO-TRUSTEES; SEPARATE TRUSTEES. (a) If
at any time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
law of any jurisdiction in which any of the Collateral shall be located, or the
Trustee shall be advised by counsel, satisfactory to it, that it is so necessary
or prudent in the interest of the Holders, or the Majority Holders shall in
writing so request, or the Trustee shall deem it desirable for its own

initial filing of a Registration Statement relating to such Registration Demand.
Each of the other such Holders shall have the right, within one Business Day
after the delivery of such notice, to request that the Company include all or a
portion of such Holder's Notes or Debentures, as the case may be, in such
Registration Statement.

(c) (i) As promptly as practicable and in no event later than
60 days after the Company receives a Registration Demand electing to register
Notes or Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(i), the Company shall file
under the Securities Act a "shelf" registration statement (the "Shelf
Registration Statement") providing for the registration and the sale on a
continuous or delayed basis of all of the Notes or Debentures, as the case may
be, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act and/or any similar rule that
may be adopted by the SEC (the "Shelf Registration"). The Company agrees to use
its best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be
declared effective no later than 60 calendar days after the filing (the "60 Day
Effective Date") and to keep such Shelf Registration continuously effective for
a period ending on the occurrence of the earlier of (x) the third anniversary of
the Registration Demand and (y) notification by all of the requesting Holders
that such Holders have sold all of the Notes or Debentures, as the case may be,
owned by them. The Company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to
the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein (x) as may
be necessary to effect and maintain the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration
Statement for the period set forth in the previous sentence and (y) as may be
required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the
registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration or by the
Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration. The
Company agrees to furnish to the Holders of the securities registered thereby
copies of any such supplement or amendment (but excluding any periodic reports
required to be filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act) so that such Holders
through the Representative(s) have a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon
prior to its being used and/or filed with the SEC.

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Company receives a
Registration Demand from a Holder or Holders of Notes or Debentures pursuant to
which such Holder is deemed to have elected to register Notes or Debentures
pursuant to an existing Shelf Registration Statement (a "Takedown"), the Company
shall file a Prospectus or any necessary supplement to a Prospectus with the SEC
and otherwise comply with the Securities Act and all rules, regulations and
instructions thereunder applicable to such Takedown. In the event that no
Prospectus or other filing is required nor any other action that necessitates
the Company's participation is required to effect a sale of Notes or Debentures,
as the case may be, pursuant to an effective Shelf Registration Statement, each
selling holder agrees to provide the Company with at least three Business Days'
notice of its intention to sell Notes or Debentures pursuant to the Shelf

-5-

<PAGE>

Registration Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall have the right
to postpone any such sale for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 90 days
if: (i) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the Company would, in
connection with such sale, be required to disclose in such Registration
Statement (or any prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith)
information not otherwise then required by law to be publicly disclosed and
(ii) in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, such
disclosure would adversely affect any material corporate development or business
transaction contemplated by the Company.

(d) As promptly as practicable and in no event later than 60 days
after the Company receives a Registration Demand electing to register Notes or
Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.1(d), the Company shall file with the SEC
a Registration Statement, on any form that shall be available and appropriate
for the sale of such Notes or Debentures in accordance with the intended method
of distribution thereof. The Company shall include in such Registration
Statement all of the Notes or Debentures, as the case may be, of such requesting
Holders that such Holders have requested to be included therein pursuant to
Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the requested
registration involves an underwritten offering, the Notes or Debentures, as the
case may be, to be registered may be reduced if the managing underwriter
delivers a notice (a "Cutback Notice") pursuant to Section 2.1(g).

The Company shall use its best efforts to cause each such Registration
Statement to be declared effective and to keep such Registration Statement
continuously effective and usable for resale of such Notes or Debentures, as the
case may be, for a period of 90 days from the date on which the SEC declares
such Registration Statement effective or such shorter period as is necessary to
complete the distribution of the securities registered thereunder.

(e) The Representative(s) shall determine the method of distribution
of Notes or Debentures pursuant to a Registration Demand.

(f) If a Registration Demand involves an underwritten offering,
Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall be the managing underwriter for such offering unless
Goldman, Sachs & Co. declines such engagement, in which event, the
Representative(s) shall select the managing underwriter; PROVIDED that such
managing underwriter so selected shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company.

-6-

<PAGE>

(g) In the event that the proposed offering is an underwritten
offering and includes securities to be offered for the account of the Company
(the "Company Securities"), the provisions of this Section 2.1(g) shall be
applicable if the managing underwriter delivers a Cutback Notice stating that,
in its opinion, the principal amount of Company Securities and the principal
amount of Notes or Debentures, as the case may be that the Holders have
requested to be registered exceeds the maximum principal amount of securities
specified by the managing underwriter in such Cutback Notice that may be
distributed without adversely affecting the price, timing or distribution of the
securities being distributed. If the managing underwriter delivers such Cutback
Notice, the number of Company Securities and Notes or Debentures, as the case
may be, requested to be registered shall be reduced in the following order until
the principal amount of securities to be registered has been reduced to the
maximum principal amount of securities specified by the managing underwriter in
the Cutback Notice: first, the Company Securities and second, the Notes or
Debentures, as the case may be, in proportion to the respective principal amount
of Notes or Debentures, as the case may be, that each Holder has requested to be
registered.

(h) No Registration Demand relating to Notes or Debentures (other
than a Takedown) may be made until the expiration of six months following the
completion of the distribution of the securities registered under any
Registration Statement that has been filed and has become effective pursuant to
a prior Registration Demand relating to Notes or Debentures, respectively.

(i) The Company shall not be obligated to file a Registration
Statement relating to any Registration Demand (other than a Takedown) unless the
requests by the Holders for such registration cover 5% or more of aggregate
principal amount of Notes or Debentures, as the case may be, then outstanding.

2.2. PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS. (a) If the Company proposes to
file a Registration Statement with the SEC respecting an offering, whether
primary or secondary, of any debt securities of the Company, the Company shall
give written notice to all the Holders of Notes and Debentures at least 30 days
prior to the initial filing of the Registration Statement relating to such
offering. Each Holder shall have the right, within 20 days after delivery of
such notice, to request in writing that the Company include all or a portion of
such Holder's Notes or Debentures in such Registration Statement ("Piggyback
Registration Rights").

-7-

<PAGE>

(b) In the event that the proposed offering is an underwritten
offering covering debt securities to be offered for the account of Company
Securities, the provisions of this Section 2.2(b) shall be applicable if the
managing underwriter delivers a Cutback Notice stating that, in its opinion, the
aggregate principal amount of Company Securities and the principal amount of
Notes or Debentures that the Holders have requested to be registered exceeds the
maximum principal amount of securities specified by the managing underwriter in
such Cutback Notice that may be distributed without adversely affecting the
price, timing or distribution of the securities being distributed. If the
managing underwriter delivers such Cutback Notice, the principal amount of
Company Securities, Notes and Debentures requested to be registered shall be
reduced in the following order until the principal amount of securities to be
offered has been reduced to the maximum principal amount of securities specified
by the managing underwriter in the Cutback Notice: first, the Notes and
Debentures in proportion to the respective principal amount of Notes and
Debentures that each Holder has requested to be registered and second, the
Company Securities.

(c) The provisions of this Section 2.2 shall not be applicable in
connection with (i) a registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to
Section 2.1 or (ii) a transaction in which a registration statement is filed by
the Company on Form S-4 or any successor forms.

2.3. COMPANY'S ABILITY TO POSTPONE REGISTRATION RIGHTS. (a) The
Company shall have the right to postpone the filing of any Registration
Statement relating to a Demand Registration for a reasonable period of time not
to exceed 90 days if: (i) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the
Company would be required to disclose in such Registration Statement information
not otherwise then required by law to be publicly disclosed and (ii) in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, such disclosure would
adversely affect any material corporate development or business transaction
contemplated by the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such 90-day period shall be
deducted from the six-month interval allowed between Registration Demands
pursuant to Section 2.1(h).

(b) If at any time after the Company notifies the Holders of its
intention to file a Registration Statement that would trigger Piggyback
Registration Rights, the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith shall
determine for any reason not to effect such registration or to postpone such
registration, the Company shall (i) in the case of a determination not to effect
such registration, be relieved of its obligation to register any Notes or

-8-

<PAGE>

Debentures of Holders requesting inclusion in such registration, and (ii) in the
case of a determination to postpone such registration, be permitted to postpone
registering the Notes or Debentures of Holders requesting inclusion in such
registration.

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify the Holders
of any postponement pursuant to this Section 2.3, specifying the reasons
therefor.

2.4. HOLDER WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS. The Company shall withdraw from
registration any Notes and Debentures on request of a Holder thereof; PROVIDED
that, in the case of a Registration Demand under Section 2.1, a Demand
Registration shall be deemed to have been made for the purpose of the number of
such Demands permitted to be made under Section 2.1(a) if the Company shall have
incurred $50,000 in expenses relating to such Demand Registration at such time
as such Holder makes such withdrawal. The Company shall not be obligated to
maintain the effectiveness of any Registration Statement if, after any
withdrawal of Notes and/or Debentures by a Holder, the principal amount of Notes
and Debentures remaining subject to such Registration Statement is less than 5%
of the aggregate principal amount of Notes or Debentures, as the case may be,
then outstanding, unless (i) the Company is also registering securities on such
Registration Statement for its own account or (ii) if such Registration
Statement relates to securities other than for the account of the Company.

3. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

3.1. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY APPLICABLE TO ALL REGISTRATION
STATEMENTS. This Section 3.1 applies to all Registration Statements filed by
the Company and referred to in Section 2.1 or 2.2. The securities covered by
each such Registration Statement are referred to as the "Registered Securities".
Each underwriter, agent, selling broker, dealer manager or similar securities
industry professional participating in any offering of the Registered Securities
is referred to as an "underwriter" or "agent" and any agreement entered into
with an underwriter or agent is referred to as an "underwriting or agency
agreement". In connection with each such registration, the Company covenants
with each Holder of Notes or Debentures participating in such offering (each, a
"selling holder") and each underwriter or agent participating therein as
follows:

(a) The Company will notify the selling holders and the managing
underwriter or agent, immediately, and

-9-

<PAGE>

confirm the notice in writing, (i) when the Registration Statement, or any
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, shall have become
effective, or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus
shall have been filed, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the SEC,
(iii) of any request by the SEC to amend the Registration Statement or
amend or supplement the Prospectus or for additional information, (iv) of
the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use
of any preliminary prospectus, or of the suspension of the qualification of
the Registered Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of
the institution or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes,
(v) if at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to
be delivered in connection with sales of the Registered Securities the
representations and warranties of the Company contemplated by
Section 3.1(i) cease to be true and correct and (vi) of the existence of
any fact that results or may result in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference containing an
untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein
not misleading.

(b) The Company will use every reasonable effort to prevent the
issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any
preliminary prospectus and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the
lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.

(c) The Company will afford the Representative(s) and the managing
underwriters a reasonable opportunity to comment prior to its being filed
with the SEC any Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, or any
amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus (including amendments of the
documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus but excluding any
periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act).

(d) The Company will furnish to each selling holder and to the
managing underwriter or agent, without charge, as many signed copies of the
Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of all amendments thereto,
whether filed before or after the Registration Statement becomes effective,
copies of all

-10-

<PAGE>

exhibits and documents filed therewith, including documents incorporated by
reference into the Prospectus, and signed copies of all consents and
certificates of experts, as such selling holder or the managing underwriter
or agent may reasonably request, and will furnish to the managing
underwriter, for each other underwriter participating in an underwritten
offering, one conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally
filed and of each amendment thereto (including documents incorporated by
reference into the Prospectus but without exhibits).

(e) The Company will deliver to each selling holder and each
underwriter or agent participating in such offering, without charge, as
many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such selling holder or such
underwriter or agent may reasonably request, and the Company hereby
consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the Securities
Act. The Company will deliver to each selling holder and each underwriter
or agent participating in such offering, without charge, from time to time
during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as supplemented or
amended) as such selling holder or such underwriter or agent may reasonably
request.

(f) The Company will comply to the best of its ability with the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder so as to
permit the completion of the distribution of the Registered Securities in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution contemplated
in the Prospectus. If at any time when a prospectus is required by the
Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Registered
Securities any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it
is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the selling holders, counsel
for the underwriters or agents or counsel for the Company, to amend the
Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that
the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the
time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the
opinion any of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration
Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the
requirements of

-11-

<PAGE>

the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, the
Company will promptly prepare and file with the SEC, subject to
Section 3.1(c), such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct
such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus comply with such requirements.

(g) The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the
selling holders or the underwriters or agents, as the case may be, to
qualify the Registered Securities for offering and sale under the
applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as the
selling holders or the managing underwriter or agents, as the case may be,
may designate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated
to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a
foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in
which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of
doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.
The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the
laws of each jurisdiction in which the Registered Securities have been
qualified as above provided.

(h) The Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of
the Registered Securities covered by a Registration Statement not then
listed on each national securities exchange on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed or, if no such securities are then
listed, on any national securities exchange if, in either case, so
requested by (i) Whitehall with respect to the Debentures for so long as it
is a holder of Debentures or (ii) GSMC with respect to the Notes for so
long as it is a holder of Notes, or if requested by the managing
underwriter.

(i) The Company shall make such representations and warranties to the
selling holders and the underwriters or agents, if any, in form, substance
and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in
underwritten public offerings.

(j) On the effective date of the Registration Statement or, in the
case of an underwritten offering, on the date of delivery of the Registered
Securities sold pursuant thereto, the Company shall cause to be delivered
to the selling holders and the underwriters or agents, if any, opinions of
counsel for the Company with respect to, among other things, the due
incorporation and good standing of the Company; the

-12-

<PAGE>

qualification of the Company to transact business as foreign corporation;
the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement; the due
authorization, execution, authentication and issuance, and the validity and
enforceability, of the Notes or Debentures, as the case may be; the absence
of material legal or governmental proceedings involving the Company; the
absence of a breach by the Company of, or a default under, agreements
binding the Company; the absence of governmental approvals required to be
obtained in connection with the registration, offering and sale of the
Notes or Debentures as the case may be; the compliance as to form of the
Registration Statement and any documents incorporated by reference therein
with the requirements of the Securities Act; the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement under the Securities Act; the security interest
created by the Collateral Trust Agreement and a statement that, as of the
date of the opinion and of the Registration Statement or most recent post-
effective amendment thereto, as the case may be, nothing has come to the
attention of such counsel which causes them to believe that either the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus included therein, as then amended
or supplemented, or the documents incorporate by reference therein (in the
case of such documents, in the light of the circumstances existing at the
time that such documents were filed with the Commission under the Exchange
Act), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (it
being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the
financial statements and other financial data included therein or omitted
therefrom).

In the event that any broker-dealer registered under the Exchange
Act shall be an "affiliate" of, or shall have a "conflict of interest"
with, the Company (each such term as defined in Schedule E to the By-Laws
of the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD")), and such
broker-dealer shall underwrite debt securities of the Company or
participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or
otherwise "assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the Rules of
Fair Practice and the By-Laws of the NASD) thereof, whether as a holder of
such debt securities of the Company or as an underwriter, a placement or
sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect of such debt securities or
otherwise, the Company shall assist such broker-dealer, in complying with
the requirements of such Rules and By-Laws, including, without limitation,
by (1) if such

-13-

<PAGE>

Rules or By-Laws, including Schedule E thereto, shall so require, engaging
a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in such Schedule) to
participate in the preparation of the registration statement relating to
such debt securities to exercise usual standards of due diligence in
respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by the
Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a
placement or sales agent, to recommend the maximum public offering price of
such debt securities, (2) paying the fees and expenses of any such
qualified independent underwriter and indemnifying the qualified
independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of
underwriters provided in Section 3.4 hereof, and (3) providing to such
broker-dealer such information concerning the Company and its affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and securityholders as may be required in
order for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of Schedule E
to the NASD Bylaws and Section 44 of the Rules of Fair Practice.

(k) Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or, in the case of an underwritten offering, at the time of
delivery of any Registered Securities sold pursuant thereto, the Company
shall cause to be delivered to the selling holders and the underwriters or
agents, if any, letters from the Company's independent public accountants
stating that such accountants are independent public accountants with
respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and
otherwise in customary form and covering such financial and accounting
matters as are customarily covered by letters of the independent public
accountants delivered in connection with primary underwritten public
offerings.

(l) If the managing underwriter or agent so requests, the
underwriting or agency agreement shall set forth in full the provisions
hereof relating to covenants, registration expenses, lock-up agreements,
indemnification and contribution contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4,
3.5, 3.8 and 3.9, with such changes therein as may be agreed to by the
managing underwriter or agent, the Company and the selling holders.

(m) The Company shall deliver such documents and certificates as may
be requested by any selling holder or the underwriters or agents, if any,
to evidence

-14-

<PAGE>

compliance with Section 3.1(i) and with any customary conditions contained
in the underwriting or agency agreement, if any.

(n) The Company will make available for inspection by representatives
of the selling holders and the underwriters or agents participating in such
offering, any attorney or accountant retained by such selling holders or
underwriters or agents and, with respect to any private placement of Notes
or Debentures, as the case may be, upon notice to the Company, prospective
purchasers, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents
and properties of the Company, and cause the Company's officers, directors
and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, underwriter or agent, attorney or accountant in connection
with the preparation of the Registration Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
any records, information or documents that are designated by the Company in
writing as confidential shall be kept confidential by each such person (by,
among other things, if so requested by the Company, entering into a
confidentiality agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Company) unless such records, information or documents become part of the
public domain through no fault of such person or unless disclosure thereof
is required by court or administrative order or the SEC (including the
federal securities law).

(o) The Company will make generally available to its security holders
as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the close of the
period covered thereby (or 90 days if such period is a fiscal year), an
earnings statement of the Company (in form complying with the provisions of
Rule 158 under the rules and regulations of the SEC under the Securities
Act), covering a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of
the Registration Statement but not later than the first day of the
Company's fiscal quarter next following such effective date.

(p) The Company will enter into such customary agreements, including
a customary underwriting or agency agreement with the underwriters or
agents, if any, and take all such other actions in connection with the
offering in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the
Registered Securities.

(q) (i) Prior to or at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective, the Company will prepare

-15-

<PAGE>

and qualify a trust indenture relating to the Notes or Debentures, as the
case may be (an "Indenture"), under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. In
the event that any modification or amendment to such Indenture is required
by such Act or the rules and regulations thereunder or by the staff of the
SEC in order so to qualify the Indenture, the Company shall without delay
solicit consents of holders (as defined in such Indenture) in the manner
and with the effect provided by such Indenture, pursuant to which such
holders shall be asked to consent to such modifications or amendments, but
only such modifications or amendments, as shall be so required. In
connection with any such solicitation, the Company shall recommend that
Holders of Notes or Debentures, as the case may be, consent to such
modifications or amendments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that such modifications or amendments may be effected without the consent
of such Holders pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the
Company shall use its best efforts to effect such modifications or
amendments without such consent.

(ii) In the event that any such amendment or modification
involves the appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Company
shall appoint a new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the Indenture.

3.2. COVENANTS OF THE SELLING HOLDERS. (a) Each selling holder
shall use its best efforts to furnish to the Company such information regarding
the distribution of such Registered Securities as is customarily requested from
selling holders in underwritten public offerings.

(b) Each selling holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from
the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 3.1(a)(vi), such selling holder will forthwith discontinue the
disposition of its Registered Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
until such selling holder's receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.1(f), or until it is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of such Prospectus may be resumed. If the Company
shall give any such notice, the Company shall extend the period of time during
which the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement effective and
usable by the number of days during the period from the date of receipt of such
notice to the date when each selling holder of Registered Securities covered by
such Registration Statement either receives the copies of a supplemented or

-16-

<PAGE>

amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.1(f) or is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of such Prospectus may be resumed.

(c) Each selling holder agrees to make customary representations and
warranties to the Company and the underwriters or agents, if any, in form,
substance and scope as are customarily made by selling holders in underwritten
public offerings, but no selling holders, as such, shall be required to make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the
Registration Statement (except as to written information furnished to the
Company by such selling holder expressly for use therein).

(d) Each selling holder agrees to provide the Company, upon receipt
of its request, with such information about the selling holder to enable the
Company to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and to execute
such certificates as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such
information and otherwise to satisfy any requirements of law.

3.3. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. (a) The Company will pay and bear all
costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement with respect to each registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2,
including, without limitation:

(i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration

Representative(s) and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

(c) Each selling holder will pay and bear all costs and expenses
incident to the delivery of the Registered Securities to be sold by it,

3.4. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) In connection with each registration
pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each selling holder, each underwriter or agent participating in such
offering, and each person, if any, who controls any selling holder or any such
underwriter or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act as
follows:

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
(or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom
of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or arising out of an untrue statement of
a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact necessary

-18-

<PAGE>
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading;

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in
settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with
the written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; and

(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including
fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the selling holders and by the
underwriters or agents), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense
is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, with respect to any selling holder or any underwriter
or agent, this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense to the extent arising out of an untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by any such selling holder or
underwriter or agent, respectively, expressly for use in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(b) Each selling holder agrees severally, and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who
signed a Registration Statement, each underwriter or agent participating in such
offering and the other selling holders, and each person, if any, who controls
the Company, any such underwriter or agent and any other selling holder within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any and all loss,
liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in
Section 3.4(a), as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or
omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary

-19-

<PAGE>

prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such selling holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement
(or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement thereto).

(c) The obligations of the Company under Section 3.4(a) and of the
selling holders under Section 3.4(b) to indemnify any underwriter or agent who
participates in an offering (or any person, if any, controlling such underwriter
or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) shall be
conditioned upon the underwriting or agency agreement with such underwriter or
agent containing an agreement by such underwriter or agent to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed a
Registration Statement, and each selling holder, and each person, if any, who
controls the Company or any such selling holder within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and
expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 3.4(a), as incurred, but
only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue
statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by such underwriter or agent expressly for use in the
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus
or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(d) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each
indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have
under this Agreement, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is
materially prejudiced thereby. If it so elects, after receipt of such notice,
an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving
such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it,
PROVIDED that the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such action with counsel chosen by it, the fees and expenses of
which, subject to the next sentence, shall be paid by the indemnifying party.
In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for (i) the Company, its officer, directors
and controlling persons as a group, (ii) the selling holders and their
controlling persons as a group and (iii) the

-20-

<PAGE>

underwriters or agents and their controlling persons as a group, in each case,
in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in
the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances.

3.5. CONTRIBUTION. (a) In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution in circumstances under which the indemnity provided for in this
Section 3 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties
although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the selling
holders and the underwriters or agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses,
liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such
indemnity incurred by the Company, the selling holders and one or more of the
underwriters or agents, as incurred, in such proportions that (i) the
underwriters or agents are responsible for that portion represented by the
percentage that the underwriting discounts and commissions for the offering
appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus (or, if not set forth on the cover
page, that are applicable to the offering) bear to the initial public offering
price appearing on the cover page (or, if not set forth on the cover page, that
are applicable to the offering) and (ii) each of the selling holders and the
Company is responsible for an equal portion of the balance.

(b) No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 3.5, each person, if any, who
controls an underwriter or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such underwriter or
agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed
a Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a
selling holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have
the same rights to contribution as the Company or such selling holder, as the
case may be.

3.6. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES TO SURVIVE. The
indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 3 and the
representations and warranties of the Company referred to in Section 3.1(i)
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any
termination of any underwriting or agency agreement, (ii) any investigation made
by or on behalf of the selling holders, the Company or any underwriter or agent
or controlling person or (iii) the

-21-

<PAGE>

consummation of the sale or successive resales of the Registered Securities.

3.7. RULE 144. The Company covenants that it will continue to file
the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder and it will take such further action as any
Holder of Debentures or Notes may reasonably request, all to the extent required
from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Notes or Debentures, as the case
may be, without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may
be amended from time to time. Upon the request of any Holder of Notes or
Debentures, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to
whether it has complied with such requirements.

3.8. PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS. No Holder of Notes or
Debentures may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless:

(a) Such Holder executes a power of attorney appointing one or more
(up to three) attorneys (each, a "Representative") designated by the
selling holders proposing to sell a majority of the Notes or Debentures, as
the case may be, proposed to be sold by all selling holders. Each such
Representative shall be authorized, on customary terms, to execute the
underwriting agreement on behalf of each selling holder and to otherwise
act for the selling holders in connection with the offering.

(b) Such Holder directly through its Representative enters into an
underwriting agreement with the Company, the other selling holders, any
selling securityholders and the underwriters, which underwriting agreement
shall comply with the provisions of this Section 3.

(c) Such Holder executes all questionnaires and other documents
required by the underwriting agreement to be executed by such Holder.

3.9. LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS. (a) The Company agrees that it will not,
directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of,
or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities of the Company, in the case of any
registration pursuant to Section 2.1, for a period of 90 days from the effective
date of any Registration Statement.

-22-

<PAGE>

(b) Each Holder whose Notes and/or Debentures are covered by a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2 agrees that it will
not, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale
of, or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities of the Company (except such
Notes and/or Debentures covered by such Registration Statement) for a period of
90 days from the effective date of any Registration Statement.

(c) The lock-up agreements set forth in Sections 3.9(a) and 3.9(b)
shall be subject to customary exceptions that may be contained in an
underwriting agreement if any such registration involves an underwritten
offering.

4. MISCELLANEOUS.

4.1. NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS. The Company covenants and agrees
that it shall not grant registration rights with respect to Registrable

4.2. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto acknowledge that there
may be no adequate remedy at law if any party fails to perform any of its
obligations hereunder and that each party may be irreparably harmed by any such
failure, and accordingly agree that each party, in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be entitled to compel
specific performance of the obligations of any other party under this Agreement
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in any court of
the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction.

4.3. NOTICES. All notices, requests, claims, demands, waivers and

the Company, or to such other address as any party may

-23-

<PAGE>

have furnished to the others in writing in accordance herewith, except that
notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

4.4. PARTIES IN INTEREST. All the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. In
the event that any transferee of any holder of Notes or Debentures shall acquire
Notes or Debentures, in any manner, whether by gift, bequest, purchase,
operation of law or otherwise, such transferee shall, without any further
writing or action of any kind, be deemed a party hereto for all purposes and
such Notes or Debentures shall be held subject to all of the terms of this
Agreement, and by taking and holding such Notes or Debentures such transferee
shall be entitled to receive the benefits of and be conclusively deemed to have
agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. If the Company shall so request, any such successor, assign or
transferee shall agree in writing to acquire and hold the Notes or Debentures
subject to all of the terms hereof.

4.5. SURVIVAL. The respective indemnities, agreements,
representations, warranties and each other provision set forth in this Agreement
or made pursuant hereto shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation (or statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of
any holder of Notes or Debentures, any director, officer or partner of such
holder, any agent or underwriter or any director, officer or partner thereof, or
any controlling person of any of the foregoing, and shall survive delivery of
and payment for the Notes and Debentures pursuant to the Loan Agreement and
Debenture Purchase Agreement and the transfer and registration of Notes or
Debentures by such holder.

CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

or interpretation of this Agreement.

any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular
instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a written instrument
duly executed by the Company and the holders of

-24-

<PAGE>

at least 75 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Notes or Debentures, as
the case may be, at the time outstanding. Each holder of any Notes or
Debentures, as the case may be, at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be
bound by any amendment or waiver effected pursuant to this Section 4.8, whether
or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment or waiver
appears on such Notes or Debentures, as the case may be, or is delivered to such
holder.

4.9. INSPECTION. For so long as this Agreement shall be in effect,
this Agreement and a complete list of the names and addresses of all the holders
of Notes and Debentures shall be made available for inspection and copying on
any business day, on reasonable notice, by any holder of Notes or Debentures, as

withholding tax on all payments pursuant to this Loan Agreement or the Notes or,

law (including for purposes of this subparagraph (iii), without limitation,
statutes, regulations, and proposed regulations) in existence on the Initial
Date or, with respect to payments to a new lending office, the date such
Non-U.S. Lender designated such new lending office with respect to a Loan.

to indemnify a Lender other than an original Lender in respect of United States
withholding taxes to the extent that those taxes are imposed as a result of a
change after the date hereof in the portfolio interest exemption. Further, for
any period with respect to which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the
Borrower with the appropriate form and, if applicable, certificate described in
this subsection (other than if the Lender is legally unable to provide such form
or certificate due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which
a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form or certificate
otherwise is not required under the first sentence of this subsection (iii),
such Lender shall not be

-15-
<PAGE>

entitled to indemnification under the Loan Documents with respect to withholding
taxes imposed by the United States.

(b) REGULATORY CHANGE. If, as a result of any change in law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or governmental or
administrative authority or the enactment of any law or regulation, (a) any
reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirements (other than
such requirements as are taken into account in determining the LIBO Rate)
relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or
other liabilities of any Lender is imposed, modified or deemed applicable; or
(b) any other condition affecting a Loan subject to the LIBO Rate (other than in
respect of taxes covered by Section 2.07(a)or expressly excluded from the
definition of Taxes as specified in Section 2.07(a)) is imposed on any Lender
and such Lender reasonably determines that, by reason thereof, the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining its Loan is increased, or any amount receivable
by such Lender hereunder in respect of any portion of its Loan is reduced, in
each case by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material (such increases in
cost and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Increased
Costs"), then the Borrower agrees that it will pay to such Lender upon its
request such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such Increased Costs to the extent such Lender reasonably determines that such
Increased Costs are allocable to its Loan. Each Lender will notify the Borrower
of any event occurring after the date hereof which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.07 as promptly as practicable after it
obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Borrower be required to
compensate any Lender for any portion of its income or franchise taxes, whether
or not attributable to payments made by such Lender. If any Lender requests
compensation under this Section 2.07, the Borrower may, by notice to such
Lender, require that such Lender furnish to the Borrower a statement setting
forth the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining
the amount thereof.

2.08. UNAVAILABILITY. Without limiting the effect of Section
2.07, in the event that, (a) the Agent shall have determined in good faith after
reasonable investigation that dollar deposits in the principal amount of the
Loans are not generally available in the London interbank market, or (b)
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, then, if the Agent
so elects, by notice to the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the

-16-
<PAGE>

then outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall be converted to a rate
equal to the then Base Rate as in effect from time to time plus 3%. If the
Agent elects to convert the interest rate applicable to the Loans to the Base
Rate plus 3% pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.08 the Borrower may, by
notice to the Agent, require that the Agent furnish to the Borrower a statement
setting forth the basis for such election.

2.09. BREAK FUNDING COSTS. The Borrower agrees that it will
reimburse each Lender on demand for any loss incurred or to be incurred by such
Lender in the reemployment of the funds released by any prepayment of any
principal balance of the Loans if such prepayment occurs other than on the last
day of an Interest Period. Such loss shall be the difference as reasonably
determined by such Lender between the amount that would have been realized by
such Lender for the remainder of such Interest Period based on the LIBO Rate
applicable for such Interest Period (without regard to the applicable spread
over the LIBO Rate referred to in Section 2.03) and any lesser amount that would
be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds received in prepayment by
making loans of the same type (but utilizing the then applicable LIBO Rate) in
the principal amount prepaid during the period from the date of prepayment to
the last day of the then applicable Interest Period.

2.10. MITIGATION. The Lenders shall use reasonable efforts to
avoid or mitigate any indemnifiable Taxes, increased cost, reduced receivable or
suspension of the availability of the LIBO Rate under Sections 2.07 and 2.08 to
the greatest extent practicable (including transferring the Loan to an
affiliate) unless, in the opinion of any Lender, such efforts would be likely to
have any adverse effect upon it.

2.11. PRO RATA TREATMENT. Except to the extent otherwise
provided herein, each Loan, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan,
and each payment of interest on the Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among the
Lenders. The Agent agrees to forward to the Lenders such principal and interest
payments on the same Business Day as such amounts are received, collected or
applied by the Agent from the Borrower unless the Agent receives such amounts
after 2:00 p.m., New York time, in which case such payments shall be forwarded
by the Agent to the Lenders on the next Business Day.

2.12. SHARING OF PAYMENTS. Each Lender agrees that, in the event
that any Lender shall obtain any payment

-17-
<PAGE>

in respect of any Loan owing to such Lender under this Loan Agreement through
the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise in
excess of its pro rata share as provided for in this Loan Agreement, such Lender
shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Lenders'
Loans, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from time to time, as
shall be equitable in order that all Lenders share such payment in accordance
with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Loan Agreement.
Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by
such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien,
counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored,
each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by
repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including
set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the
amount of such participation.

options, warrants, conversion rights or agreements or commitments of any
character relating to the Borrower's authorized and issued, unissued or treasury

contained in such documents governing the issuance of debt including provisions
governing the rights of indenture trustees and/or administrative agents and bank
set-off and sharing provisions, as applicable, (e) the New Documents will

additions hereto or variations herefrom as are requested by any rating agency
rating the New Debt, including, without limitation, requiring accrual of
payments that are due in escrow or trust accounts, except to the extent
otherwise prohibited by the 1985 Indenture and except that no such escrow shall
be required in respect of regularly scheduled payments on account of the Loans
and (f) the New Documents will be in such form and will contain such terms and
provisions as are necessary to comply with all applicable securities laws,
including, in the case of an indenture, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Borrower will provide the Lenders
with all such documents and information, financial or otherwise, assist in all
such due diligence and do such other things and enter into such other agreements
as are necessary or, in the judgment of the Lenders, desirable to resell the

SECTION 8
THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS

8.01. THE AGENCY. Each Lender appoints Goldman Sachs Mortgage
Company as its Agent hereunder and irrevocably authorizes the Agent to take such
action on its behalf and to exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are
specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental hereto and thereto, including the
execution and delivery by the Agent on behalf of such Lender of the Collateral
Trust Agreement and any documents related thereto and the exercise by the Agent
of powers delegated to the Agent and the Lenders thereby, and the Agent hereby
accepts such appointment subject to the terms hereof. The relationship between
the Agent and the Lenders shall be that

-38-
<PAGE>

of agent and principal only and nothing herein or therein shall be construed to
constitute the Agent a trustee for any Lender nor to impose on the Agent duties
or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein.

8.02. THE AGENT'S DUTIES. The Agent shall promptly forward to
each Lender copies, or notify each Lender as to the contents, of all notices and
other communications received from the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Loan Agreement, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement and
the Letter Agreement and, in the event that the Borrower fails to pay when due
the principal of or interest on any Loan, the Agent shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Lenders. As to any other matter not expressly provided for
herein or therein, the Agent shall have no duty to act or refrain from acting
with respect to the Borrower, except upon the instructions of the Required
Lenders. The Agent shall not be bound by any waiver, amendment, supplement, or
modification of this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents which affects
its duties hereunder and thereunder, unless it shall have given its prior
written consent thereto. The Agent shall have no duty to ascertain or inquire
as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants
or agreements binding on the Borrower pursuant to this Loan Agreement, the
Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement
nor shall it be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default (other than a failure of the Borrower to pay when due the
principal or interest on any Loan), unless it shall have received written notice
from the Borrower or a Lender specifying such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".

8.03. THE AGENT'S LIABILITIES. Each of the Lenders and the
Borrower agrees that (i) neither the Agent in such capacity nor any of its
officers or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them hereunder except for its or their own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct, (ii) neither the Agent in such capacity nor any of its
officers or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them in good faith in reliance upon the advise of counsel,
independent public accountants or other experts selected by the Agent, and (iii)
the Agent in such capacity shall be entitled to rely upon any notice, consent,
certificate, statement or other document (including any telegram, cable, telex,
facsimile or telephone transmission) believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed and/or sent by the proper Persons.

-39-
<PAGE>

8.04. THE AGENT AS A LENDER. The Agent shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" or "Lenders", unless the
context otherwise indicated, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The
Agent may, without any liability to account, maintain deposits or credit
balances for, invest in, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of
banking business with the Borrower or any affiliate of the Borrower as if it
were any other Lender and without any duty to account therefor to the other
Lenders.

8.05. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers or employees has any responsibility for, gives any guaranty in respect
of, nor makes any representation to the Lenders as to, (i) the condition,
financial or otherwise, of the Borrower or the truth of any representation or
warranty given or made herein or in any other Loan Document, or in connection
herewith or therewith or (ii) the validity, execution, sufficiency,
effectiveness, construction, adequacy, enforceability or value of this Loan
Agreement, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the
Letter Agreement or any other document or instrument related hereto or thereto.

Collateral Trust Agreement and the Letter Agreement to which the Agent is a
party, the Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
with respect to the operations, business, property, condition or
creditworthiness of the Borrower, whether such information comes into the
Agent's possession on or before the date hereof or at any time thereafter. Each
Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender, based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Loan Agreement and to authorize the Agent to execute on its behalf the
Collateral Trust Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document.

8.06. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Lender agrees (which agreement shall
survive payment of the Loans and the Notes) to indemnify the Agent, to the
extent not reimbursed by the Borrower, ratably in accordance with their Loans
(as of the

-40-
<PAGE>

time of the incurrence of the liability being indemnified against), from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, claims, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Loan Agreement
or any other Loan Document, or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Agent hereunder or thereunder; PROVIDED, that no Lender shall be liable for
any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the
gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent or any of its officers or
employees. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the
Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses
(including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in such capacity in connection
with the preparation, execution or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Loan Agreement, the Assignment of
Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement or any
amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, to the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower.

8.07 SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, and the Agent may be
removed at any time by the Required Lenders by giving written notice thereof to
the Agent, the other Lenders and the Borrower at least 10 Business Days prior to
the effective date of such removal. Upon any such resignation or removal, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Agent's giving
of notice of resignation, or the Required Lenders' giving notice of removal, as
the case may be, the resigning or removed Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the
laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers
privileges and duties of the resigned or removed Agent, and the resigned or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Loan Agreement. After any Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Section 8 shall

Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations
hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Loan Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any

shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder including the right to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Loan Agreement; PROVIDED, that such
participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any
modification, amendment or waiver of this Loan Agreement described in clauses

benefits of Sections 2.07, 2.09 and 9.04 with respect to its participating

Lender had not granted such participation to the Participant.

(c) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other
institutions (each as "Assignee") all or a proportionate part, of its rights and
obligations under this Loan Agreement and its Note, and such Assignee shall
assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an instrument executed by such
Assignee, such transferor Lender and the Agent. Upon execution and delivery of
such an instrument, notification to the Borrower of such Assignment and payment
by such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase
price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee
shall be a Lender party to this Loan Agreement and shall have all the rights and
obligations of a Lender and the transferor Lender shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent. Upon the consummation of any
assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Lender, the Agent and
the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new
Note is issued to the Assignee.

-43-
<PAGE>

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
9.01 a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders
and the principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender from time to time
(the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders shall treat only the Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

9.03. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the
part of the Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or
under any of the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the
Letter Agreement and no course of dealing between the Borrower and any Lender
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any of the Security Documents,
the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Lenders would otherwise
have. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the
Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Lenders to any other
or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

9.04. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower agrees
to:

(i) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery and administration of this Loan Agreement, the Security
Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement and the Letter Agreement and the
documents and instruments referred to therein and in connection with the
resale of the Loans, the exchange of the Notes for the New Debt and the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of any New Documents as
contemplated by Section 5.09 (including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of Sullivan & Cromwell and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton,
special counsel to the Agent, and any indenture trustee, administrative
agent

-44-
<PAGE>

or like parties in respect of the New Debt, and the reasonable travel
expenses of employees of the Agent) and any amendment, waiver or consent
relating hereto or thereto including, but not limited to, any such
amendments, waivers or consents resulting from or related to any work-out,
renegotiation or restructure relating to the performance by the Borrower
under this Loan Agreement and of the Agent and the Lenders in connection
with enforcement of the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement
and the Letter Agreement and the documents and instruments referred to
therein (including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Agent and the Lenders);

(ii) pay and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless from and
against any and all present and future stamp and other similar taxes with
respect to the foregoing matters and save the Agent and the Lenders
harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay or omission (other than to the extent
attributable to the Agent or the Lenders) to pay such taxes;

(iii) indemnify the Agent and the Lenders, their respective officers,
directors, partners, employees, representatives, affiliates and agents
from and hold each of them harmless against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by any of them as a
result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of,
any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the
Agent or any Lender is a party thereto) related to the entering into
and/or performance of this Agreement, the Security Documents, the
Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement or the use of proceeds
of the Loans hereunder or the consummation of any other transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, the Security Documents, the Collateral
Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement (including the resale of the Loans
and the exchange of the Notes as contemplated by Section 5.09), including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other
proceeding, as the same are incurred (but excluding any such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Person to be
indemnified); and

-45-
<PAGE>

(iv) if the indemnification provided for in Section 9.04(iii) is
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the Borrower shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Borrower on the one hand and
the Lenders and the Agent on the other from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Loan Agreement. If, however, the
allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted
by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the
relative fault of the Borrower on the one hand and the Lenders and the
Agent on the other in connection with the actions which resulted in such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative benefits received by the Borrower on the one hand and the Agent
and the Lenders on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from the Loans (before deducting
expenses) received by the Borrower bear to the net fees paid in accordance
with Section 3.01(g) and retained by the indemnified Agent or Lender. The
relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the action of the Borrower on the one hand or the Lenders and the
Agent on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The Borrower and the Lenders and the Agent agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection
(iv) were determined by any method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this
subsection (iv). The amounts paid or payable by an indemnified party as a
result of the losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (iv) shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim, as the same are incurred.

-46-
<PAGE>

Neither the Agent nor any Lender, nor any of their partners, directors,
officers, agents or employees, shall be liable to the Borrower for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or any of them under or in connection with
any Loan Document, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct
attributable to such Person.

9.05. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. Any provision of this
Loan Agreement, the Notes, any of the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust
Agreement or the Letter Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required
Lenders (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the
Agent); PROVIDED, that no such amendment, waiver or modification shall, unless
signed by all the Lenders (i) subject any Lender to any additional obligation,
(ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any fees
hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iv) change the percentage of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Lenders, which
shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under this
Section 9.05 or any other provision of this Loan Agreement, (v) release all or
substantially all of the collateral for the Loans or (vi) amend or waive the
provisions of Section 6.12 or this Section 9.05.

9.06. COUNTERPARTS. This Loan Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Loan Agreement to produce or
account for more than one such counterpart.

9.07. HEADINGS. The headings of the sections and subsections
hereof are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Loan Agreement.

9.08. SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITIES. All indemnities set forth herein,
including, without limitation, in Section 9.04, shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Loan Agreement, the making of the Loan, and the repayment of
the Loan and other obligations hereunder.

-47-
<PAGE>

9.09. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

(a) THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Nothing herein shall affect
the right of the Agent or any Lender to commence legal proceedings or to
otherwise proceed against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction.

(b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions
or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Loan Agreement, any of
the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement
brought in the courts referred to in subsection (a) hereof and hereby further
irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any
such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

(c) THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS LOAN AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

9.10. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Loan Agreement is
determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
fully severable and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
effect and shall be construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions.

9.11. ENTIRETY. This Loan Agreement together with the other Loan
Documents represents the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any,
relating to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated herein;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained herein shall affect any of the
obligations of the Borrower to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Whitehall (and their
respective affiliates) under the letter of intent, dated November 17, 1994 among
the Borrower and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Whitehall.

9.12. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made by the Borrower

-48-

herein shall survive delivery of the Notes and the making of the Loans
hereunder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused a

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ROCKEFELLER CENTER PROPERTIES, INC.
ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. INVESTMENT

New York, N.Y. -- December 29,1994 -- Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. (RCPI)
announced today that it had closed the previously announced transaction under
which Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and Whitehall Street Real Estate Limited
Partnership V (Whitehall), an investment vehicle managed by Goldman, Sachs &
Co., agreed to purchase from RCPI $225 million of long-term debt. Goldman Sachs
Mortgage Company has acquired from RCPI $150 million of floating rate debt due
December 31, 2000 which will bear interest at LIBOR plus 4 percent and Whitehall
has acquired from RCPI $75 million of 14 percent debentures due December 31,
2007. RCPI has also issued to Whitehall warrants to acquire 4,155,927 shares of
newly issued common stock exercisable at $5 per share, and 5,349,541 stock
appreciation rights convertible into debentures or warrants.

Richard M. Scarlata, President & Chief Executive Officer of RCPI, reported that
the Company had received net proceeds of approximately $214.4 million, and had
used the proceeds to retire commercial paper borrowings of $193.1 million; to
retire, at a cost of approximately $10.6 million, interest rate swaps with a net
notional principal of $145 million; and to pay approximately $2.1 million of
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the review of its capital
structure, which has now been concluded. The balance of the proceeds of this
transaction will be applied by the Company to general corporate purposes.

"We are pleased to have concluded this important transaction for our Company
before the end of the year, allowing RCPI to enter 1995 on a strong financial
footing," said Mr. Scarlata.

The Company also announced that Claude M. Ballard, Jr. today stepped down as
Chairman and Director of the Company, and Dr. Peter D. Linneman, Director of the
Wharton Real Estate Center and a professor of real estate and finance at The
