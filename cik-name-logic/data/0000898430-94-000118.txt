ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On January 31, 1994, Merisel, Inc. (the "Company"), through a wholly-
owned subsidiary, Merisel FAB, Inc. ("Merisel FAB"), completed its acquisition
of certain assets (the "Assets") of the United States Franchise and Distribution
Division (the "Division") of ComputerLand Corporation ("ComputerLand") pursuant
to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") dated January 31, 1994
among ComputerLand, Merisel FAB and the Company (a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 10.1).

The Division (and now Merisel FAB) is a distributor of microcomputer 
products to a network of two specific customer groups: "ComputerLand" 
franchisees, with whom Merisel FAB acts as a franchisor by licensing the 
"ComputerLand" name and providing both product supply and various support 
services and "Datago" affiliates, which are independent dealers and value added 
resellers that purchase products from Merisel FAB on a cost-plus basis, but do 
not license the "ComputerLand" name.

Merisel FAB paid approximately $80 million in cash for the Assets. In
addition, the Purchase Agreement provides for a payment in 1996 of up to $30
million based upon the growth in the Company's and Merisel FAB's sales of
designated vendor products to former Division customers over the two year period
ending January 31, 1996. The Assets' purchase price was established by arms
length negotiations between the Company and ComputerLand.

The principal Assets purchased by Merisel FAB consist of the
Division's franchise and third party reseller agreements and substantially all
of the rights in the United States to ComputerLand's trademarks, trade names,
service marks, copyrights, patents and logos.

The purchase of the Assets was financed by (i) a borrowing of $65
million under a credit agreement dated as of December 23, 1993 between the
Company and NationsBank of Texas, N.A. ("NationsBank") and guaranteed by Merisel
FAB (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4) and (ii) a borrowing of
$16 million under a credit agreement dated as of January 31, 1994 among Merisel
FAB, the Company, as guarantor, and NationsBank (a copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 10.6). The $65 million facility matures on January 29, 1995,
but is subject to mandatory prepayment upon any debt or equity issuance by the
Company. Borrowings under such facility may bear interest at either a LIBOR
based rate or a prime/federal funds-based rate, at the option of the Company.
This facility provides that the interest rate increases 0.5% per annum at the
end of each three month period subsequent to January 31, 1994 and requires a fee
of $162,500 if not prepaid by the end of July 1994. The $16 million facility
matures on February 15, 1994 and bears interest at a prime/federal funds-based
rate.

In connection with the acquisition of the Assets, Merisel FAB and
ComputerLand entered into a Distribution and Services Agreement (the "Services
Agreement") pursuant to which ComputerLand will provide significant distribution
and other support services to Merisel FAB for up to two years. Under the
Services Agreement, Merisel FAB will receive up to $20 million in extended
credit terms on its product purchases from ComputerLand. ComputerLand has
agreed to use this amount to purchase shares of

2.
<PAGE>

the Company's Common Stock at a per share price of $18.13, if and when a
registration statement covering the resale of such shares is declared effective
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Company has guaranteed the obligations of Merisel FAB under the
Purchase Agreement and the Services Agreement pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement
dated January 31, 1994 (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2).

The foregoing summary of the Company's acquisition of the Assets is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the exhibits attached hereto.

certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof among the Company,

on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

A G R E E M E N T
- - - - - - - - -

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual

subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company shall issue and sell to
the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase that number of shares of Common
Stock (the "Shares"), rounded to the nearest whole share, determined by dividing

<PAGE>

SECTION 2

Representations and Warranties of the Company
---------------------------------------------

The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser that:

2.1 Due Authorization and Execution. The Company has all necessary
------------------------------- 
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of the Company has
duly authorized and approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement. No
other corporate proceeding or action on the part of the Company or its
stockholders is necessary to authorize and approve the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming due execution and delivery by the Purchaser,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
(a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating
to creditors' rights generally, (b) equitable principles (whether considered in
an action at law or in equity) or (c) laws or principles of law limiting the
enforceability of indemnification of or contribution for violations of
securities laws.

2.2 Organization of the Company. The Company is a corporation duly
--------------------------- 
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of State of
Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company
has made available or provided to the Purchaser complete and correct copies of
its charter and bylaws, each as amended to the date hereof. Each subsidiary of
the Company (a "Subsidiary") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its respective state of incorporation,
and each has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company
and each Subsidiary are duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in all other jurisdictions that require such
qualification or licensing except where the failure to so qualify would not have
a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
prospects, results of operation, or financial condition of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "Company Material Adverse Effect").

-2-
<PAGE>

2.3 Capitalization.
-------------- 

(a) The Company's authorized capital stock consists of 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, none of which shares were issued and outstanding as
of the date hereof, and 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 29,604,229
shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 1993. All of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued,
are fully paid and non-assessable and are free of preemptive rights with respect
thereto. Except with respect to plans and agreements filed as exhibits to the
SEC Filings (as defined in Section 2.4), there are no outstanding preemptive,
conversion or other rights, options, warrants or agreements granted or issued by
or binding upon the Company for the purchase or acquisition of any shares of its
capital stock. Except with respect to shares of capital stock issued pursuant
to the foregoing plans and agreements, no shares of capital stock have been
newly issued by the Company since December 31, 1993.

(b) All Shares to be issued pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.

2.4 Financial Statements and SEC Reports. The Company heretofore has
------------------------------------ 
delivered to the Purchaser true and complete copies of its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1992 (the "1992 10-K"), the Proxy
Statement for the Company's 1993 Annual Meeting of Stockholders as filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and any filings made with the
SEC since December 31, 1992 (the "SEC Reports") including any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein (the
"Company Financial Statements" and collectively with the SEC Reports, the "SEC
Filings"). As of their respective dates, the SEC Filings complied in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (along with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"Securities Act") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (along
with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Exchange Act"). As of their
respective dates, the SEC Filings did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company Financial Statements included
in the SEC Filings were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (as in effect from time to time) applied on a consistent
basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except
that the quarterly financial statements do not contain all of the footnote
disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles) and present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of the

-3-
<PAGE>

Company and its subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated
(subject, in case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal year-
end adjustments).

2.5 No Violation. Neither the execution and delivery of, nor the
------------ 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement will result in
any of the following: (a) a default or an event that, with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default, breach or violation of the charter,
bylaws or other governing instruments of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any contract, agreement, license or instrument to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their properties are
bound; (b) an event that would permit any Person, as such term is defined in the
Exchange Act, to terminate any contract, agreement, license or instrument to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them
or their properties are bound, or to accelerate the maturity of any indebtedness
or other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (c) the creation
or imposition of any lien, mortgage, pledge, charge or encumbrance of any kind
upon any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) a violation or
breach of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental instrumentality to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or by which any of them or their properties are bound; or (e) the
necessity to obtain the consent or approval of, or give notice to or register
with any nongovernment third party, in each of the cases set forth in (a)
through (e) above subject to exceptions which will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

2.6 Governmental Consents. Other than in connection with the Hart-
--------------------- 
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the Securities
Act (as contemplated by Section 4), no notice to or filing with, and no
authorization, consent or approval of, any domestic or foreign court or any
public or governmental body or authority is necessary for the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
notices or filings the failure to give or make, and authorizations, consents and
approvals the failure to obtain, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or materially and adversely affect the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

2.7 Compliance with Law. Neither the Company nor any of its
------------------- 
Subsidiaries has been, or is now, in violation of any federal, state or local
laws, regulations or orders relating to the operation, conduct or ownership of
the property or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which
violations have

-4-
<PAGE>

or will have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has all licenses, permits and certificates from governmental
agencies necessary for the conduct of its business as now conducted, the failure
of which would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

2.8 Litigation. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
---------- 
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at law or in equity, or before or by any
federal, state, municipal or other governmental department, commission, board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, which, if adversely
determined, would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, award, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, which has or could have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

2.9 No Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 1993 the Company
-------------------------- 
has not suffered any Company Material Adverse Effect.

2.10 Registration Statement. On the effective date of the
---------------------- 
Registration Statement (as defined in Section 4), the Registration Statement
(including documents incorporated therein by reference, financial statements and
schedules) other than the Written Information (as defined in Exhibit A) and the
prospectus relating thereto will contain all material information required to be
included therein by the Securities Act and will conform in all material respects
to the requirements of the Securities Act and will not include any untrue
statement of a material fact or will omit to state a material fact required to

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

SECTION 3

Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Purchaser
----------------------------------------------------------

The Purchaser represents, warrants and covenants to the Company that:

3.1 Investment Intent. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for
----------------- 
investment for the Purchaser's own account and not with the view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of any
applicable securities laws. The Purchaser understands that the issuance of the
Shares has not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of specified
exemptions therefrom which depend upon, among other

-5-
<PAGE>

things, the bona fide nature of the Purchaser's investment intent as expressed
herein and as explicitly acknowledged hereby.

3.2 Investigation and Experience. The Purchaser has had an
---------------------------- 
opportunity to discuss the Company's business, management and financial affairs
with the Company's management. The officers of the Company have made available

answered, to the Purchaser's satisfaction, all inquiries made thereby. The
Purchaser acknowledges that the investment in the Shares contemplated by this
Agreement involves risk. The Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of an investment in the Company and has the capacity to protect its own
interests in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

3.3 Compliance with Laws. The Purchaser understands and agrees that
-------------------- 
the issuance of the Shares it is acquiring hereunder have not been registered
under the Securities Act and are characterized as "Restricted Securities" under
the federal securities laws and that under such laws and applicable regulations
such securities may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only
in reliance on exemptions available under the Securities Act. In this
connection the Purchaser represents that it is aware of and understands Rule 144
under the Securities Act, as presently in effect. Purchaser agrees that any
resale of the Shares by the Purchaser will be in compliance with all applicable
securities laws.

3.4 Accredited Investor. The Purchaser is an "accredited investor"
------------------- 
within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act.

SECTION 4

Exhibit A to
Stock Purchase Agreement

Registration Rights for Shares
------------------------------

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
respective meanings given such terms in the Stock Purchase Agreement (the
"Agreement") to which Exhibit A is attached.

1. Definitions. For purposes of this Exhibit A;
----------- 

(a) the term "registration statement" shall mean a registration
statement on Form S-3 (or other appropriate form) of the Company filed with the
SEC which covers the resale of the Shares, including any amendments or
supplements thereto;

(b) the terms "effective" and "declaration of the effectiveness"
refer to any declaration of the effectiveness of a registration statement by the
SEC;

(c) the term "registration expenses" means all reasonable
expenses incurred by the Company in complying with Section 2 hereof, including,
without limitation, all registration and filing fees and printing expenses but
shall not include the fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants for the
Company; and

(d) the term "prospectus" shall mean the prospectus included in
the registration statement, as amended or supplemented.

2. Obligations of the Company. In connection with the
-------------------------- 
registration of the resale of the Shares pursuant to the provisions of Section
4.1 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company shall use it best efforts to:

(a) (i) Prepare and file the registration statement with
the SEC and cause the registration statement to become effective by as soon as
practicable, and (ii) keep the registration statement effective until the
earlier of (A) 36 months following the date of Closing (which period shall be
extended for the period during which any holder of Shares shall be required to
discontinue the disposition of the Shares pursuant to the last paragraph of this
Section 2) or (B) the date on which all Shares have been sold pursuant to the
registration statement or an exemption from registration is available.

(b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements
to the registration statement and any prospectus used in connection with the
registration statement as may be

1.
<PAGE>

necessary to keep the registration statement effective for the period set forth
in clause (a) above and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all Shares.

(c) Furnish to each holder of Shares such number of copies of the
registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein)
and the prospectus included in the registration statement (including each
preliminary prospectus) as such holder may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Shares; and the Company hereby consents
(subject to the last paragraph of this Section 2) to the use of the prospectus
(or any supplement or amendment thereto) by each of the selling holders of
Shares in connection with the offering and sale of Shares.

(d) Promptly notify the selling holders of Shares (i) when the
registration statement, the prospectus or any prospectus or any prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such
registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
registration statement or the prospectus or for additional or supplemental
information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings
for that purpose, (iv) at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the Company's becoming
aware that the prospectus included in the registration statement, as then in
effect, or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, or (v)
of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to the
registration statement would be appropriate.

(e) Make reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement hereunder or
any post-effective amendment thereto as promptly as practicable.

(f) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section
2(d)(iv) or (v) above, as promptly as practicable prepare a supplement or
post-effective amendment to the registration statement or a supplement to the
prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference, or file any other required document so that, as

2.
<PAGE>

thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Shares being sold thereunder, such
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(g) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Shares
which have been so registered to be listed on each securities exchange and the
National Association of Securities Dealers' interdealer quotation system on
which the Common Stock is then listed, if any.

(h) Register or qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the
securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as any holder of Shares
requests in writing; keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption
therefrom) effective during the period the Registration Statement is required to
be kept effective; and do any and all other acts or things necessary or
advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Shares;
provided, however, that the Company will not be required to qualify generally to
- -------- ------- 
do business in any jurisdiction where it not then so qualified or to take any
action which would subject it to general service of process in any jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject; and provided that all out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company in complying with this Section 2(h) shall be borne by
the requesting holder (and this amount shall not be limited by the proviso
contained in Section 4).

Each holder of Shares agrees by acquisition of such Shares that, upon
receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 2(d)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), such holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of Shares until such holder's receipt of the copies of
the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 2(f), or until it
is advised in writing (the "Advice") by the Company that the use of the
applicable prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments
or supplements thereto.

3. Furnish Information. Each holder of Shares shall furnish to
-------------------
the Company such information regarding itself, the Shares held by such holder,
and the intended method of disposition of such Shares as shall be required under
the Securities Act to effect the registration of the Shares. In that
connection, each holder of Shares shall be required to represent to the Company
that all such information which is given is both complete and accurate in all
material respects.

3.
<PAGE>

4. Expenses of Registration. All registration expenses
------------------------ 
incurred by the Company in connection with the registration pursuant to this
Exhibit A shall be borne by the Purchaser; provided, that the Purchaser's
-------- 
maximum obligations under this Section 4 shall be an amount equal to the actual
registration and listing fees paid by the Company to the SEC and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. plus $5,000.

5. Indemnification.
--------------- 

(a) To the extent permitted by the Securities Act, the
Company will indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Shares, each person, if
any, who controls each holder of Shares within the meaning of the Securities Act
or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and
their respective employees, officers, directors, partners and agents
(collectively, the "Indemnifiable Parties"), against any and all losses,
claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (joint or several), insofar as such
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
arise from or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or
violations (collectively a "Violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement,
including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or
any amendments or supplements thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the
-------- ------- 
indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5(a) shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action
if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any
such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action to the
extent that it arises from or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance
upon and in conformity with the Written Information (as defined in Section 5(b))
furnished by the Indemnifiable Party seeking indemnification, nor shall the
Company be liable to an Indemnifiable Party for any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, expense or action to the extent that it arises from or is based upon
(i) any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission
contained in any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, or any amendments
or supplements thereto, delivered by such Indemnifiable Party after the Company
had provided notice to the holder of Shares, that such preliminary or final
prospectus or such amendment or supplement thereto contained such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission or (ii) the
failure of such Indemnifiable Party to deliver any preliminary prospectus or
final prospectus,

4.
<PAGE>

or any amendments or supplements thereto, required under applicable securities
laws, including the Securities Act, to be so delivered, provided that a
sufficient number of copies thereof had been provided by the Company to such
Indemnifiable Party.

(b) To the extent permitted by the Securities Act, each
holder of Shares will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if
any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, and their respective employees, officers, directors, partners and
agents (collectively, the "Company Indemnifiable Parties") against any and all
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (joint or several), insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereto) arise from or are based upon any Violations to the extent (and only to
the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with
the respective written information furnished by such holder of Shares for use in
connection with such registration, including (without limitation) the Financial
Statements, (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of the date
hereof (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), among the Purchaser, Merisel FAB and,
for purposes of Section 2.2 thereof, the Company) provided by the Purchaser
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, (the "Written Information"). If and
to the extent that the Company asserts claims hereunder with respect to the
Financial Statements, (i) such claim shall be treated, for the purposes of
determining the amount of liability only, as if it were a Loss under Section 7.6
of the Asset Purchase Agreement and shall be cumulated with any other Losses
thereunder for the purposes of applying the monetary limitations on
indemnification set forth therein, and (ii) in no event shall any indemnity
under this Section 5(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by
such holder of Shares. In no event will any holder of Shares have any liability
under this Section 5(b) for any Violations by any other holder of Shares.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any action
by a governmental agency), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 5,
notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof and the
indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall
-------- ------- 
have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses of one such
counsel to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, based upon the written opinion
of counsel for the indemnified

5.
<PAGE>

party, representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the
indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict
of interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by
such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to promptly notify an indemnifying
party of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying
party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 5 to the
extent such failure was prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, but
the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any
liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this
Section 5.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5
is unavailable to any indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims,
damages, expenses, liabilities actions referred to herein, then each such
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities or actions in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and
the holders of Shares in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities or actions, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
Company and the holders of Shares shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.

The Company and the holders of Shares agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of
the losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities or actions referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5 no holder of
Shares shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the proceeds of the offering (before deducting expenses) received by such
holder, exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder, has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or

6.
<PAGE>

alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of 
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was 
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(e) The obligations of the Company and each holder of 
Shares under this Section 5 shall survive the completion of any offering of 
Shares in a registration statement made under the terms of the Agreement, 
including this Exhibit A.

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of January 31, 1994,
among COMPUTERLAND CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(the "Seller"), MERISEL FAB, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Buyer"), and, for purposes of Section
2.2 hereof, MERISEL, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Merisel").

The Seller is engaged in the sale, distribution and servicing of
microcomputer systems and related products and services throughout the world.
Through its United States Franchise and Distribution Division, the Seller is
engaged in the business (the "Subject Business") of granting franchises to
dealers of microcomputer systems and products located in the Designated
Territory (as defined in Section 1.1(a)) and conducting the wholesale
distribution of microcomputer systems and products to such franchisees and to
independent dealers located in the Designated Territory. The Seller desires to
sell, transfer, convey and assign to the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to
purchase and acquire from the Seller, certain assets and rights of the Seller
relating to the Subject Business, subject to the assumption by the Buyer of
certain obligations and liabilities of the Seller, in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. For convenience of
reference, the Seller's businesses other than the Subject Business are referred
to herein as the "Retained Businesses".

The Buyer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merisel, which has been
organized by Merisel for the purpose of acquiring the Subject Business from the
Seller. In connection therewith, and as an inducement for the Seller to execute
and deliver this Agreement with the Buyer, Merisel is executing and delivering
to the Seller simultaneously herewith a Guaranty Agreement (the "Guaranty
Agreement") with respect to the payment and performance by the Buyer of all
Guaranteed Obligations (as defined therein), including, without limitation, the
obligations of the Buyer under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2 hereof.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

Year Volume to the Base Volume PLUS (B) the net percentage point change
---- 
determined by comparing the Second Year Volume to the Base Volume shall be
equal to or greater than zero, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller $6,000,000

PLUS an amount equal to $200,000 TIMES the net sum of such percentage point
---- ----- 
changes, including a PRO RATA portion of $200,000 for the portion of such
--- ---- 
increase that is less than a whole percentage point, subject to adjustment
as provided in Section 5.7 of the Services Agreement.

The Buyer shall pay to the Seller, in addition to the Earnout Amount, (1)
interest on the Earnout Amount, accruing from February 28, 1996 through and
including the date of payment, at an annual rate equal to the rate published on
February 28, 1996 in the national edition of The Wall Street Journal as the
----------------------- 
prime rate in effect on such date plus 2% per annum and (2) all costs of
collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Seller in
collecting under or enforcing the provisions of this Section 2.2(d). In no
event shall the Earnout Amount exceed $30,000,000 PLUS (x) interest due thereon
---- 
and (y) costs of collection referred to above. The obligations of the Buyer
under this Section 2.2 shall not be limited by the provisions of Section 7.6
hereof, nor shall the provisions of Section 7.7 hereof apply to the rights of
the Seller in collecting under or enforcing the provisions of this Section 2.2.

(e) By way of example:

(A) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 120
Second Year Volume = 130
Net Percentage Point Increase = 50 (i.e., the sum of
20, or the 120 over 100,
and 30, or the increase
of 130 over 100)

Payment: $6,000,000 plus 50 times $200,000 = $16,000,000

-15-
<PAGE>

(B) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 140
Second Year Volume = 14
Net Percentage Point Increase = 80 (i.e., the sum of 40, or the 140
over 100, and 40, or the increase of
the next 140 over 100)

Payment: $6,000,000 plus 80 times $200,000 = $22,000,000

(C) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 160
Second Year Volume = 60
Net Percentage Point Increase = 20 (i.e., the sum of 60, or 160 over
100, and negative 40, or the decrease
of 100 to 60)

Payment: $6,000,000 plus 20 times $200,000 = $10,000,000

(D) Base Volume = 100
First Year Volume = 50
Second Year Volume = 100
Net Percentage Point Increase = negative 50 (i.e., the sum of
negative 50, or the decrease of 100 to
50, and 0, or the increase of 100 over
100)

Payment: 0

(f) Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall keep accurate records which
shall be sufficient for the computation of Eligible Volume for all relevant
periods hereunder and, upon reasonable advance notice, shall make such records
available to the other and such other's independent public accountants for
inspection during normal business hours. The expenses of any such inspection
shall be borne by the inspecting party unless such inspection reveals that
Eligible Volume for any period certified hereunder was inaccurate by $1 million
or more and resulted in or would have resulted in an incorrect payment to or by
the inspecting party.

(g) The parties acknowledge that if any Open Distribution Vendor
engages in Open Distribution, the Subject Business and the Other Distribution
Business may compete with one another in connection with some or all of the
Products of such Open Distribution Vendor. In that regard, during the Earnout
Period the Merisel Group will not engage in any practice if it is reasonably
established that the principal purpose of such

-16-
<PAGE>

practice is (i) to reduce or minimize the Earnout Amount or (ii) to render the
Buyer Subject Business uncompetitive vis-a-vis the Other Distribution Business
in a manner that is not reasonably justifiable. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Merisel Group will conduct the Buyer Subject Business and
the Other Distribution Business in accordance with the following general
guidelines, consistent with reasonable and prudent business practices:

(iii) The Merisel Group shall not cause or permit the Other
Distribution Business to adopt or pursue any programs or policies, or any
general terms and conditions with respect to the sale of Products, that
alone or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in
incremental sales of such Products being made for net consideration below
the marginal cost to the Other Distribution Business of such Products
unless such sale is justifiable in light of competitive business conditions
or is for the purpose of achieving higher rebate levels or liquidating
excess inventory;

(iv) The Merisel Group shall not prevent or prohibit the Buyer
Subject Business from adopting or pursuing any programs or policies, or
setting any pricing or other terms and conditions with respect to the
purchase or sale of Products, that the management of the Buyer Subject
Business reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Buyer
Subject Business, except to the extent that (A) any such programs,
policies, pricing or other terms or conditions, alone or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in incremental sales of Products
being made for net consideration below the marginal cost to the Buyer
Subject Business of such Products or (B) such programs, policies, pricing
or other terms or conditions are not likely to provide the Buyer Subject
Business with a competitive return on investment, taking into account,
without limitation, the risks associated with such programs, policies,
terms and conditions, the impact on the cost structure of the Buyer Subject
Business and the capital investment made and to be made in the Buyer
Subject Business (including, without limitation, the purchase price payable
by Buyer hereunder and the financing costs associated with operating the
Buyer Subject Business); and

(v) For purposes of the guideline set forth in clause (i) above,
for any period in which Applicable Revenue (as defined in the Services
Agreement) is reasonably projected to be in excess of Baseline Revenue
(as defined in the Services Agreement) for such period, the Merisel
Group shall assume that the marginal cost to the Other Distribution
Business of any incremental sale of such

-17-
<PAGE>

Products is at least [*] above the vendor cost of the Products sold
(without giving effect to any programs, policies, pricing or other terms or
conditions adopted by the Other Distribution Business after the date hereof
that would reasonably be expected to increase such marginal cost).

(h) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if,
for any period in which any Open Distribution Vendor engages in Open
Distribution, any member of the Merisel Group breaches any of its obligations
under Section 2.2(g), the Inventory Cost of those Products of such Open
Distribution Vendor sold by any member of the Merisel Group in connection with
the Other Distribution Business as a result of such violation will be included
in Eligible Volume for such period for all purposes of this Section 2.2. The
legal fees and expenses incurred by any party in connection with any legal
action involving an alleged breach by the Buyer and/or the Merisel Group, or any
member thereof, of Section 2.2(g) shall be borne by the party who shall not
prevail in such dispute.

(i) In the event that, at any time during the Earnout Period, there
is a material increase, decrease or change in the product lines of any Eligible
Vendor sold under the name of such Eligible Vendor, as a result of any merger,
acquisition, divestiture, reorganization or other event, Merisel, the Buyer and
the Seller shall cooperate with one another in good faith and use their
respective best efforts to agree on an appropriate modification of the products
included in measuring the Base Volume and Eligible Volume, so that the
comparisons between Base Volume and Eligible Volume provided for in this Section
2.2 shall better serve the purposes of this Section 2.2.

(j) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during
the Earnout Period the Buyer shall not assign or delegate to any other person or
entity any rights or interests of the Buyer in, to or under any franchise
agreement, distribution agreement or other similar instrument or agreement
between the Buyer and any Buyer Datago Purchaser or Buyer Franchisee without the
prior written consent of the Seller, and any such assignment or delegation (or
attempted assignment or delegation) shall be void ab initio; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
-- ------ -------- ------- 
that the Buyer may make such an assignment or delegation to any member of the
Merisel Group without the consent of the Seller so long as all amounts that
otherwise would have been included in Eligible Volume (assuming that such member
of the Merisel Group was the Buyer) shall continue to be so included; PROVIDED
--------
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the Seller shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to
- ------- ------- 
any other such assignment or delegation so long as

______________
[*] Omitted pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.

-18-
<PAGE>

arrangements are made, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Seller, to provide
for the inclusion in Eligible Volume of all amounts that otherwise would have
been included in Eligible Volume (assuming that such assignee or delegatee was
the Buyer).

(k) Except as provided in Section 5.7 of the Services Agreement, the
obligations of the Buyer and Merisel under this Section 2.2, including, without
limitation, the obligation to pay the Earnout Amount and other amounts due under
this Section 2.2, shall be absolute and unconditional, without any right of
offset whatsoever.

2.3. ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price shall be
---------------------------- 
allocated among the Purchased Assets and the Restrictive Covenant in accordance
with the allocation set forth on ANNEX 2.3 hereto and the Seller and the Buyer
--------- 
shall prepare their Federal, state and local income tax returns employing such
allocation.

-------- 
HOWEVER, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the
- ------- 
defense of any Proceeding if (i) such Proceeding seeks an

-34-
<PAGE>

-------- ------- 
not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the
Indemnified Party. In addition, if the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the

its own counsel and the fees and expenses of both counsel to the Indemnified

------------------------------------------------- 
Buyer acknowledges the validity, value and goodwill in the "ComputerLand" name
and the Seller's proprietary rights therein with respect to the Seller's use
thereof anywhere in the world other than the Designated Territory. All parties
acknowledge that no right, title and interest with respect to the Trademarks and
the goodwill appurtenant thereto shall be retained by the Seller in the
Designated Territory. In order to protect such validity, value and goodwill, to
the extent the Buyer uses the "ComputerLand" name, the Buyer shall use the
"ComputerLand" name and any mark confusingly similar with the "ComputerLand"
name in a commercially reasonable manner at all times and shall protect its
rights in each such name in the same manner in which Merisel has previously
protected its rights in the proprietary trade names, service marks and
trademarks of Merisel. The Buyer shall not challenge or interfere with the
Seller's use or ownership of the "ComputerLand" name or use or seek to register
or otherwise establish rights in the "ComputerLand" name, or any confusingly
similar name, anywhere in the world other than in the Designated Territory.

(b) The Seller acknowledges the validity, value and goodwill in the
Trademarks and the Buyer's proprietary rights therein within the Designated
Territory following the Closing. In order to protect such validity, value and
goodwill, to the extent the Seller uses one or more of the Trademarks, or any
mark confusingly similar with one or more of the Trademarks, outside of the
Designated Territory, the Seller shall use such terms in a commercially
reasonably manner at all times and shall protect its rights in such names in the
same manner in which the Seller has previously protected its rights in the
Trademarks anywhere in the world and in the same manner in which the Seller
protects its rights in any other proprietary trade names, service marks and
Trademarks owned by the Seller. The Seller shall not challenge or interfere
with the Buyer's use or ownership of any of the Trademarks or use or seek to
register or otherwise attempt to establish rights in any mark confusingly
similar with any of the Trademarks anywhere within the Designated Territory.

8.2. SELLER'S RESTRICTIVE COVENANT. (a) Except in connection with
----------------------------- 
the performance of the agreements set forth in Section 1.5 hereof, from the
Closing until the 36th monthly anniversary of the Closing (the "Restriction
Period"), the Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in the sale or
distribution of microcomputers or similar products to third party resellers of
such products located anywhere in the Designated Territory; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
-------- ------- 
that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to:

(i) sales of any products to (A) any company that purchases such
products primarily for internal use, (B) any company that is engaged
in the resale of such products to third parties that are (1)
affiliates of such company or (2) otherwise engaged in an independent
business relationship with such company or an affiliate of such
company where the resale of such products is an ancillary activity of
such business relationship (e.g., an independent insurance broker that
acquires such products from a reseller division or subsidiary of an
insurance company or a hotel franchisee that acquires such products
from a reseller division or subsidiary of the hotel franchisor), (C)
any financial leasing company, (D) any rental company, (E) any company
engaged in the original equipment manufacturing of microcomputer
products, (F) any company set forth on SCHEDULE 8.2 or (G) any company
------------ 
whose primary business involves either of the following activities:

(x) the purchase of products as agent for ultimate end-users
where such end-users are billed directly by the Seller for such
products; or

(y) the purchase of products which are integrated into end-
users' systems where such company retains title to such products;
or

(ii) sales of spare parts to any person or entity.

As used in this Section 8.2, any legal entity or division thereof shall
constitute a "company" if such legal entity or division shall be the direct
purchaser of such products from the Seller. In addition, the Seller shall not,
during the Restriction Period, (1) perform any distribution services (including
configuration services) substantially similar to those provided to the Buyer
under the Services Agreement for computer resellers, aggregators or
distributors, (2) act as a franchisor with respect to franchisees that compete
with the Subject Business in any manner or (3) initiate any program if it is
reasonably established that the principal purpose of such program is to permit
the Seller to cause a third party reseller to change its method of doing
business so as to enable the Seller to be eligible to claim the benefit of
clause (G)(x) or (y) above. Anything contained in

-38-
<PAGE>

this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Seller's performance under
the Services Agreement shall not be deemed a breach of this Section 8.2. In the
event the Buyer and the Seller shall enter into negotiations regarding the
extension of the Distribution Period (as defined in the Services Agreement),
then it is the intention of the Seller and the Buyer to discuss the extension of
the Restriction Period as part of conducting such negotiations.

(b) The Seller has carefully considered the nature and extent of the
restrictions set forth herein and acknowledges that the same are reasonable with
respect to scope, duration and territory. It is the desire and intent of the
Seller and the Buyer that the provisions of this Section 8.2 be enforced to the
fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement thereof is sought. Accordingly, if any
provision of this Section 8.2 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable, such provision, without any action on the part of the Seller or
the Buyer, shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom or to modify provisions
thereof so as to restrict (including, without limitation, a reduction in
duration, geographical area or prohibited business activities) the portion
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such deletion or modification to
apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular
jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made, and such deletion or
modification to be made only to the extent necessary to cause the provision as
amended to be valid and enforceable. It is further acknowledged that any
monetary remedy for any breach of the Seller's covenant set forth in Section
8.2(a) will be inadequate and that the Buyer will be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief against the Seller in addition to any other relief
or remedies to which the Buyer may be entitled, without the necessity of proving
actual damages.

8.3. ACCESS. (a) To the extent permitted by applicable law or
------ 
existing contractual arrangement, the Seller shall, upon request, permit the
Buyer and its representatives, at reasonable times during normal business hours
and in a reasonable manner which is not disruptive to the operations of the
Seller, to inspect and to make copies of (at the expense of the Buyer) all
records of the Seller relating to the Subject Business prior to the Closing,
including, without limitation, sales and royalty records, accounting records and
employee records. The Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid entering
into agreements prohibiting or restricting the Buyer's access to the records of
the Subject Business. The Seller represents and warrants to the Buyer that,
except with respect to vendor agreements and agreements set forth on SCHEDULE
--------
8.3(A), there are no existing contractual restrictions on the ability of the
- ------ 
Seller to provide access to such records to the Buyer. Any information provided
pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) shall be treated in accordance with Section 8.5.
The Seller shall not dispose of

-39-
<PAGE>

such records during the five-year period commencing with the Closing without the
Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Following the expiration of such five-year period, the Seller may dispose of
such records at any time following 90 days' prior written notice to the Buyer.
During such 90-day period, the Buyer shall have the right, at the Buyer's sole
expense, to take possession of all or any part of such records at a time to be
agreed upon by the Seller and the Buyer. In addition to the foregoing, the
Seller shall provide to the Buyer copies of, and the Buyer shall have the
nonexclusive right to use within the Designated Territory, (i) all mailing
addresses of and any other data relating to the Franchisees and Datago
Purchasers, (ii) all vendor lists relating to the Subject Business and (iii all
forms, catalogs, brochures, advertising materials, training and marketing
manuals and franchise and Datago operating manuals relating to the Subject
Business, including, without limitation, ACCESS materials and materials relating
to the Agreements, Program and services referred to in Sections 1.2(k) through
(n).

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable law or existing contractual
arrangement, the Buyer shall, upon request, permit the Seller and its
representatives, at reasonable times during normal business hours and in a
reasonable manner which is not disruptive to the operations of the Buyer, to
inspect and to make copies of (at the expense of the Seller) all records of the
Buyer relating to the Buyer Subject Business. The Buyer shall use its
reasonable efforts to avoid entering into agreements prohibiting or restricting
the Seller's access to the records of the Buyer Subject Business. The Buyer
represents and warrants to the Seller that, except with respect to vendor
agreements and agreements set forth on SCHEDULE 8.3(B), there are no existing
--------------- 
contractual restrictions on the ability of the Buyer to provide access to such
records to the Seller. Any information provided pursuant to this Section 8.3(b)
shall be treated in accordance with Section 8.5. The Buyer shall not dispose of
such records during the five-year period commencing with the Closing without the
Seller's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Following the expiration of such five-year period, the Buyer may
dispose of such records at any time following 90 days' prior written notice to
the Seller. During such 90-day period, the Seller shall have the right, at the
Seller's sole expense, to take possession of all or any part of such records at
a time to be agreed upon by the Seller and the Buyer.

8.4. RENEWALS AND ASSIGNMENTS OF FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. From and
------------------------------------------------ 
after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause each Franchisee renewing or assigning a
Franchise Agreement to enter into a new franchise agreement with the Buyer and
to release the Seller from its obligations thereunder as a condition to such
renewal or assignment.

-40-
<PAGE>

8.5. CONFIDENTIALITY MATTERS. (a) At the Closing, the Seller shall
----------------------- 
assign to the Buyer all of the Seller's right, title and interest in any
confidentiality agreements to the extent such agreements pertain to the sale of
the Subject Business entered into by the Seller in connection with the sale of
the Subject Business and, if available, shall deliver to the Buyer the executed
originals of such agreements. The Seller shall not amend, modify or supplement,
or grant any consent or waiver under or with respect to, any of such
confidentiality agreements without the Buyer's prior written consent.

(b) From and after the Closing, each of the Buyer and the Seller
shall maintain the confidentiality of all confidential or proprietary
information of the other party, including marketing, advertising and promotional
methods, agreements with vendors, manufacturers, distributors and other
suppliers, Franchise Agreements, Datago Agreements, customer lists, pricing
policies, financial information, sales volume, inventory procedures and amounts,
logistic systems, computer programs (including source code and object code),
ideas, concepts, processes, research and development and other information
related to the business or customers of such other party (collectively,
"Confidential Information"). Neither party will use (except in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), transfer, release,
publish or disclose, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information of the
other party, without such other party's prior written consent, except as
required by law. Confidential Information does not include any information that
(i) becomes generally known or available to the public, through no fault of such
party, (ii) was known by such party, without any obligation of confidentiality,
prior to the date hereof or (iii) is lawfully obtained by such party after the
date hereof from a third party not bound by any obligation of confidentiality to
the other party. Each party understands that the other party will not have an
adequate remedy at law for a breach or threatened breach by such party of the
terms of this Section and therefore agrees that in the event of such a breach or
threatened breach, the other party may obtain an injunction or restraining order
to enjoin such breach or threatened breach, in addition to any other available
remedy.

8.6. SALE OF CERTAIN NOTES AND EQUITY - RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER. In the
------------------------------------------------------- 
event the Seller desires to sell any of its right and interest in and to the
notes receivable set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1(F) or the equity interests set forth
--------------- 
on SCHEDULE 3.1(E) (collectively, the "Investments") at any time during the one-
--------------- 
year period following the Closing Date, the Seller shall first offer to sell any
such Investment to the Buyer pursuant to a written notice (the "Offer Notice")
setting forth the proposed purchase price for such Investment and all other
material terms relating to such sale. The Buyer shall have the right to accept
such offer by providing written notice (a "Notice of Acceptance") of its
acceptance thereof to the Seller at any time within 15 days

-41-
<PAGE>

following the Buyer's receipt of the Offer Notice. The closing of the purchase
and sale of any Investment to the Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall occur
within 30 days of the Buyer's delivery to the Seller of a Notice of Acceptance
on the terms set forth in the Offer Notice. If the Buyer does not deliver a
Notice of Acceptance to the Seller within the aforementioned 15-day period, the
Seller shall have the right to sell such offered Investment to any party within
the six-month period following the Seller's delivery to the Buyer of the Offer
Notice upon terms no less favorable to another buyer than those set forth in the
Offer Notice delivered to the Buyer. In the event such sale is not consummated
within such six-month period or if the purchase price or other material terms of
such proposed sale are more favorable than those set forth in the Offer Notice,
the offered Investment shall again be offered to the Buyer pursuant to this
Section 8.6 if the one-year first offer period has not expired. The parties
shall use their best efforts and act in good faith in order to carry out the
intent of this Section 8.6, and shall enter into such agreements and execute
such instruments of transfer as shall be necessary and appropriate to effect the
sale, if any, contemplated by the provisions of this Section 8.6. Nothing
contained in this Section 8.6 shall prevent the Seller from amending or waiving
any provision of the Investments or any agreement or instrument relating to the
Seller's rights under the Investments.

8.7. CHANGE OF NAME. The Seller shall change its corporate name to a
-------------- 
name which does not include "ComputerLand", "Datago" or any name similar thereto
by filing an amendment to the Seller's Restated Certificate of Incorporation
with the Delaware Secretary of State within 90 days after the Closing.

8.8. VENDOR CONSENTS. After the Closing, at the written request of
---------------- 
the Buyer, the Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer and work in good faith with
the Buyer to obtain the consents of the vendors and Datago Purchasers
contemplated by SCHEDULE 3.1(B) identified in writing by the Buyer and which
--------------- 
were not obtained on or prior to the Closing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither
-------- ------- 
the Buyer nor the Seller shall be required to incur any obligations or
liabilities in obtaining any such consent, except for ordinary and necessary
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith, which expenses shall be
borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller.

8.9. NO SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Except as provided in Article X,
---------------------------- 
from the date hereof through December 31, 1995, neither the Buyer nor the Seller
shall solicit the employees of the other or any other person who was employed by
the other within six months of his or her termination of such employment.

8.10. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. After the Closing, at the written
-------------------- 
request of the Buyer, and at the Buyer's expense, the Seller shall cooperate
with the Buyer and its accountants to

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

10.1. OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER. Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer
-------------------- 
shall extend offers of employment to all employees of the Seller employed in
conducting the Subject Business immediately prior to the Closing on general
terms of employment, including base salary, commission, bonus, benefits and
similar arrangements, substantially comparable to those under which such
employees were employed by the Seller immediately prior to the Closing on an
aggregate basis (recognizing that individual differences in specific terms of
employment may exist), except for one employee of the Subject Business on leave
on the Closing Date, to whom the Buyer shall offer such employment upon return
from such leave. The Buyer shall reimburse the Seller promptly upon written
demand for any payroll amounts paid by the Seller to any employee of the Subject
Business who shall accept the Buyer's offer with respect to any period after the
date hereof. The Buyer shall credit the employees employed in conducting the
Subject Business who shall accept the Buyer's offer with the full length of
their period of service with the Seller for purposes of determining their
eligibility to participate in, and the calculation of benefits under, the
employee benefit plans of the Buyer and for purposes of calculating severance
obligations of the Buyer to such employees; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for purposes
-------- ------- 
of calculating the eligibility of employees of the Subject Business to
participate in the 401(k) plan maintained by the Merisel Group, no employee of
the Subject Business shall be credited with more than five years of service upon
being hired by the Buyer. In connection therewith, the Buyer shall be
responsible for and shall pay all claims for severance made by the employees
employed in conducting the Subject Business who shall accept the Buyer's offer
and shall be responsible for accrued and unpaid vacation of such employees to
the extent of the amount of the payment for such accrued and unpaid vacation
received from the Seller pursuant to Section 10.2(b). The Buyer shall be
responsible for all benefit claims of the employees employed in conducting the
Subject Business who shall accept the Buyer's offer arising after the Closing
relating to periods after to the Closing, including severance payments, COBRA
coverage, workmen's compensation, unemployment compensation and other government
mandated benefits. The Buyer acknowledges that the Seller makes no
representation

-43-
<PAGE>

that any of its employees will accept the Buyer's offer of employment. The
Buyer shall have no liability with respect to the employment or termination of
employment of any of the Seller's employees who do not accept the Buyer's offer
of employment so long as such employees are not successful in asserting that
their employment by the Seller had been constructively terminated solely by
virtue of the offer of employment made by the Buyer. The Buyer represents and
warrants to the Seller that employees of the Merisel Group who are attributed
with at least five years of service by the Merisel Group shall be fully vested
under the 401(k) plan maintained by the Merisel Group.

10.2. OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER. The Seller shall (a) deliver to the
--------------------- 
Buyer no later than three days prior to the Closing a list of all employees of
the Seller then employed in conducting the Subject Business, (b) deliver to the
Buyer within 30 days after the Closing Date a check in an amount which shall
represent the Seller's calculation of all accrued and unpaid vacation pay on or
prior to the Closing due to the employees of the Subject Business who accept the
Buyer's offer and who are identified by the Buyer to the Seller prior to the
15th day after the Closing and (c) be responsible for all liabilities that have
accrued with respect to periods ending prior to the Closing with respect to the
employees of the Subject Business, except for severance obligations to the
employees of the Subject Business who accept the Buyer's offer and accrued and
unpaid vacation owed to such employees in the amount referred to in clause (b)
above. The Seller acknowledges that, after the Closing, the Buyer shall have
the right, subject to the Buyer's obligations set forth in Section 10.1, to make
all decisions regarding employment matters based on its sole determination as to
the Buyer's business needs and performance of its employees.

<DESCRIPTION>GUARANTY AGREEMENT
<TEXT>
<PAGE>

GUARANTY AGREEMENT dated as of January 31,
1994, between MERISEL, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Merisel"), and COMPUTERLAND
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Seller").

Reference is made to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January
31, 1994 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), among the Seller, Merisel FAB, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Merisel (the
"Buyer"), and for purposes of Section 2.2 thereof, Merisel.

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Seller has agreed to
sell, assign and deliver to the Buyer, and Buyer has agreed to purchase, assume
and pay for, the Purchased Assets, on the terms and conditions set forth
therein.

Merisel desires the Buyer to enter into and perform its obligations
under the Asset Purchase Agreement, to purchase, assume and pay for the
Purchased Assets as provided therein and to perform all of the Buyer's other
obligations incurred in connection therewith. Accordingly, in order to induce
the Seller to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement, Merisel is willing to
guarantee unconditionally the payment and performance by the Buyer of the
Guaranteed Obligations (as hereinafter defined).

The Seller is relying on this Guaranty Agreement in entering into the
Asset Purchase Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated thereby,
and is not willing to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement, or to sell or
agree to sell the Purchased Assets to the Buyer on the terms and conditions set
forth therein, unless it receives the unconditional guaranty of Merisel in
accordance herewith.

Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and of other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Merisel and the Seller hereby agree as follows:

1. Merisel hereby guarantees to the Seller, its successors and
assigns, absolutely and unconditionally, the payment and performance in full,
when and as due, of all liabilities and obligations of the Buyer arising under
or in respect of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the License Agreement, the
Sublease, the Services Agreement or any other instrument or agreement entered
into in connection therewith, including, without limitation, the purchase of the
Purchased Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Obligations and the payment in
full of

-1-
<PAGE>

the aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets (collectively, the
"Guaranteed Obligations").

2. This Guaranty Agreement is a continuing guaranty and shall remain
in full force and effect so long as any Guaranteed Obligation remains
outstanding or shall exist; provided, however, that this Guaranty Agreement
-------- ------- 
shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, except as to any claim
brought hereunder prior to such date.

3. Merisel hereby consents that from time to time, before or after
any default of any Guaranteed Obligation or any notice of termination hereof,
with or without further notice to or assent by Merisel, that (a) any security at
any time held by or available to the Seller for any obligation of the Buyer, or
any security at any time held by or available to the Seller for any obligation
of any other person secondarily or otherwise liable for any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, may be exchanged, surrendered or released, (b) any obligation of
the Buyer, or of any such other person, may be changed, altered, renewed,
extended, continued, surrendered, compromised, waived or released in whole or in
part, or any default with respect thereto waived, and (c) the Seller may fail to
set off or may release, in whole or in part, any balance of any deposit or
credit on its books in favor of the Buyer, or of any such other person, (d) the
Seller may extend further credit in any manner whatsoever to the Buyer, and (e)
the Seller may generally deal with the Buyer or any security or other person as
the Seller may see fit; and Merisel shall remain bound under this Guaranty
Agreement notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the foregoing.

4. Merisel hereby waives (a) notice of acceptance of this guaranty
and of any and all extensions of credit by the Seller to the Buyer; (b)
presentment and demand or payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c)
protest and notice of dishonor or default to Merisel or to any other party with
respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (d) all other notices to which
Merisel might otherwise be entitled; and (e) any demand for payment under this
Guaranty Agreement.

5. This is a guaranty of payment and performance and not a guaranty
of collection. Merisel waives any right to require that any action be brought
against the Buyer or any other person or that resort be had to any security or
to any balance of any deposit or credit on the books of the Seller in favor of
the Buyer or any other person.

6. Merisel hereby represents and warrants to the Seller that:

(a) Due Authorization and Execution. Merisel has all necessary
------------------------------- 
corporate power and authority to enter into this Guaranty Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of
Merisel has duly authorized and approved the execution and delivery of this

-2-
<PAGE>

Guaranty Agreement and the performance by Merisel of its obligations under this
Guaranty Agreement. No other corporate proceeding or action on the part of
Merisel or its stockholders is necessary to authorize and approve the execution
and delivery of this Guaranty Agreement or the performance by Merisel of its
obligations under this Agreement. This Guaranty Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Merisel and, assuming due execution and
delivery by the Seller, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Merisel
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement
may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally or (b) equitable principles
(whether considered in an action at law or in equity).

(b) Organization of Merisel. Merisel is a corporation duly
----------------------- 
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of State of
Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. Merisel has
made available or provided to the Seller complete and correct copies of its
charter and bylaws, each as amended to the date hereof. Each subsidiary of
Merisel (a "Subsidiary") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of its respective state of incorporation, and
each has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease
its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. Merisel and each
Subsidiary are duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in all other jurisdictions that require such
qualification or licensing except where the failure to so qualify would not have
a material adverse effect on the business prospects, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operation, or financial condition of Merisel and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Merisel Material Adverse Effect").

(c) Financial Statements and SEC Reports. Merisel heretofore has
------------------------------------ 
delivered to the Seller true and complete copies of its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1992 (the "1992 10-K"), the Proxy
Statement for Merisel's 1992 Annual Meeting of Stockholders as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and any filings made with the SEC
since December 31, 1992 (the "SEC Reports") including any financial statements
or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein (the "Merisel
Financial Statements" and collectively with the SEC Reports, the "SEC Filings").
As of their respective dates, the SEC Filings complied in all material respects
with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(along with the rules regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act") and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (along with the rules regulations
thereunder, the "Exchange Act"). As of their respective dates, the SEC Filings
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements

-3-
<PAGE>

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Merisel Financial Statements included in the SEC Filings were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (as in
effect from time to time) applied on a consistent basis (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except that the quarterly
financial statements do not contain all of the footnote disclosures required by
generally accepted accounting principles) and present fairly the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Merisel and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated (subject, in case of
unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

(d) No Violation. Neither the execution and delivery of, nor the
------------ 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Guaranty Agreement will
result in any of the following: (a) a default or an event that, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default, breach or violation of the
charter, bylaws of other governing instruments of Merisel or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any contract, agreement, license or instrument to which Merisel
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their
properties are bound; (b) an event that would permit any Person, as such term is
defined in the Exchange Act, to terminate any contract, agreement, license or
instrument to which Merisel or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of them or their properties are bound, or to accelerate the maturity of any
indebtedness or other obligation of Merisel or any of its Subsidiaries; (c) the
creation or imposition of any lien, mortgage, pledge, charge or encumbrance of
any kind upon any asset of Merisel or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) a violation
or breach of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Merisel or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental instrumentality to which Merisel or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them or their properties are bound; or (e) the
necessity to obtain the consent or approval of, or give notice to or register
with any nongovernment third party, in each of the cases set forth in (a)
through (e) above subject to exceptions which will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Merisel Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Governmental Consents. No notice to or filing with, and no
--------------------- 
authorization, consent or approval of, any domestic or foreign court or any
public or governmental body or authority is necessary for the consummation by
Merisel of the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty Agreement, except for
notices or filings the failure to give or make, and authorizations, consents and
approvals the failure to obtain, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Merisel Material Adverse Effect, or materially and adversely affect the
ability of Merisel to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) Compliance with Law. Neither Merisel nor any of its Subsidiaries
------------------- 
has been, or is now, in violation on any

that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurodollar
Loan is determined as provided in this Agreement or of a category of extensions
of credit or other assets of the Bank that includes the Eurodollar Loan or (ii)

give such notice and (ii) the Bank will designate a different Applicable Lending
Office for the Loan if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, such compensation by an amount determined by the Bank to be material
and will not, in the sole opinion of the Bank, be disadvantageous to the Bank,
except that the Bank shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending
Office located in the United States of America. The Bank will furnish to the
Company a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by the
Bank for compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01.

of this Section 5.01, on its costs or rate of return of maintaining the Loan or
------------ 
its obligation to make the Loan, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of

rates of interest for the Eurodollar Loan as provided in this Agreement; or

<PAGE>

(b) if the Bank determines, which determination shall be conclusive,
that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar
Base Rate" in Section 1.01 upon the basis of which the rate of interest for the
------------ 
Eurodollar Loan for such Interest Period is to be determined are not likely to
cover adequately the cost to the Bank of making or maintaining the Eurodollar
Loan for such Interest Period;

then the Bank shall give the Company prompt notice of such determination and, so
long as such condition remains in effect, the Bank shall be under no obligation
to make the Loan as a Eurodollar Loan, to Continue the Eurodollar Loan or to
Convert the Base Rate Loan into the Eurodollar Loan, and the Company shall, on
the last day of the then current Interest Period for the outstanding Eurodollar
Loan, either prepay such Loan or Convert such Loan into the Base Rate Loan in

obligation to make or maintain the Eurodollar Loan, then the Bank shall promptly
notify the Company of such event and the Bank's obligation to make or to
Continue, or to Convert the Base Rate Loan into, the Eurodollar Loan shall be
suspended until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain the
Eurodollar Loan (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04 shall be
------------ 
applicable).

5.04 Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of the Bank to
--------------------------- 
make the Eurodollar Loan or to Continue, or to Convert the Base Rate Loan into,
the Eurodollar Loan shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03, such
------------ ---- 
Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically Converted into the Base Rate Loan on the
last day of the then current Interest Period (or, in the case of a Conversion
required by Section 5.01(b) or 5.03, on such earlier date as the Bank may
--------------- ---- 
specify to the Company) and, unless and until the Bank gives notice as provided
below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03 that gave rise to
------------ ---- 
such Conversion no longer exist, the Loan shall be made or maintained as a Base
Rate Loan. The Bank agrees, promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist,
to give notice to the Company that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01
------------
or 5.03 that gave rise to the Conversion of the Eurodollar Loan pursuant to this
---- 
Section 5.04 no longer exist.
- ------------ 

5.05 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Bank, upon the
------------ 
request of the Bank, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of the Bank) to

Credit Agreement

compensate it for any loss, cost or expense that the Bank determines is
attributable to:

(a) any payment, mandatory or optional prepayment or Conversion of
the Eurodollar Loan for any reason (including the acceleration of the Loan
pursuant to Section 9) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period
--------- 
for such Loan; or

(b) any failure by the Company for any reason (including the failure
of any of the conditions precedent specified in Section 6 to be satisfied) to
--------- 
borrow the Eurodollar Loan from the Bank on the date for such borrowing
specified in the relevant notice of borrowing given pursuant to Section 2.02.
------------ 

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall
include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or
Converted or not borrowed for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the
Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified
for such borrowing) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided
for in this Agreement over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have
accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest
component of the amount the Bank would have bid in the London interbank market
for Dollar deposits of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal
amount and with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably determined
by the Bank).

5.06 Taxes. The Company agrees to pay to the Bank such additional
----- 
amounts as are necessary in order that the net payment of any Obligation due to
the Bank after deduction for or withholding in respect of any Tax imposed with
respect to such payment (or for payment of such Tax by the Bank), will not be
less than the amount of the Obligation then due and payable. For the purposes
of this Section 5.06, "Taxes" shall mean any present or future tax, assessment
------------ ----- 
or other charge or levy imposed by or on behalf of any Governmental Person
(other than taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net income of the Bank
or of its Applicable Lending Office by the jurisdiction in which the Bank has
its principal office or any Applicable Lending Office). Within 30 days after
paying any amount to the Bank from which it is required by law to make any
deduction or withholding, and within 30 days after it is required by law to
remit such deduction or withholding to any relevant taxing or other authority,
the Company shall deliver to the Bank evidence

consequences, with the understanding that events giving rise to any defense or
right waived may diminish, destroy or otherwise adversely affect rights which
the Parent otherwise may have against the Company, the Bank or any other Person
or against any collateral. If, notwithstanding the intent of the parties that

part of the Obligations (whether by contract or operation of law, including
under the Bankruptcy Code) by reason of any payment or other performance by any
Parent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5 and agrees for the benefit
--------- 
of each of the Company's creditors (including the Bank) that any such payment by
it shall constitute a contribution of capital by the

Parent to the Company. The Parent further agrees that, to the extent that the
waiver of, or agreement not to exercise, any such rights, remedies, powers or
privileges is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable
for any reason, any such rights, remedies, powers or privileges the Parent may
have shall be junior and subordinate to the rights, remedies, powers and
privileges of the Bank against the Parent under this Section 5.
--------- 

5.05 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Parent under this
------------- 
Section 5 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any

reason any payment by or on behalf of the Company or any other Person or any
other application of funds (including the proceeds of any collateral for all or
any part of the Obligations) in respect of all or any part of the Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of such Obligations,
whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy, reorganization or
otherwise and the Parent agrees that it will indemnify the Bank on demand for
all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel)
incurred by the Bank in connection with such rescission or restoration.

5.06 Remedies. The Parent hereby agrees that, between it and the
-------- 
Bank, the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement and the Note may
be declared to be forthwith (or may become automatically) due and payable as

--------- ------------ 
injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations
becoming due and payable as against the Company) and that, in the event of such

(whether or not due and payable by the Company) shall forthwith become due and
payable for purposes of Section 5.01.

action or actions against the Parent whether or not the Company, any other

Person, or any collateral for all or any part of the Obligations. The
obligations of the Parent under, and the effectiveness of, this Section 5 are
--------- 
not conditioned upon the existence or continuation of any other guarantee
(including any letter of credit) of all or any part of the Obligations.

5.08 Subordination of Indebtedness of the Company. The Parent
-------------------------------------------- 
agrees that any indebtedness of the Company now or in the future owed to the
Parent is hereby subordinated to the

Credit Agreement
________________

- 20 -
<PAGE>

Obligations. If the Bank so requests, any such indebtedness shall be collected,
enforced and received by the Parent as trustee for the Bank and shall be paid
over to the Bank in kind on account of the Obligations. If, after the Bank's
request, the Parent fails to collect or enforce any such indebtedness or to pay
the proceeds of such indebtedness to the Bank, the Bank as the Parent's
attorney-in-fact may do such acts and sign such documents in the Parent's name
and on the Parent's behalf as the Bank considers necessary or desirable to
effect such collection, enforcement or payment, the Bank being hereby appointed

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
ComputerLand Corporation

We have audited the accompanying statement of revenues and operating expenses of
the United States Franchise and Distribution Division of ComputerLand
Corporation for the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992. This statement of
revenues and operating expenses is the responsibility of ComputerLand
Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this
statement of revenues and operating expenses based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the statement of revenues and operating
expenses is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of
revenues and operating expenses. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall statement of revenues and operating expenses
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the statement of revenues and operating expenses referred to
above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and operating
expenses of the United States Franchise and Distribution Division of
ComputerLand Corporation for the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

United States Franchise and Distribution Division of
Computerland Corporation

Notes to Statement of Revenues and Operating Expenses

September 30, 1993

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

The United States Franchise and Distribution Division of ComputerLand
Corporation (the Division) is not an incorporated entity. The principal
activity of the Division is the wholesale distribution of microcomputer systems
and products to third party dealers, value-added resellers, and franchisees.

Historical Financial Information

Full historical statements of revenues and operating expenses,
including interest income, interest expense, and income taxes, have not been
presented due to the fact that ComputerLand Corporation has never maintained
separate accounting records for the Division, and, therefore, has not prepared
separate historical financial statements of the Division. Construction of such
full accounting records and financial statements is not practicable.

The statement of revenues and operating expenses may not necessarily
reflect the results of operations that would have been obtained had the Division
been operated as a separate stand-alone entity during the period presented.

Revenue and Revenue Recognition

Revenues consist primarily of product sales to third party dealers,
value-added resellers, franchisees, and end-users, as well as royalty income on
sales made by ComputerLand franchisees. Sales to end-users are sales of
products initiated by franchisees that are configured and shipped directly to
customers from ComputerLand Corporation's distribution centers for which
franchisees receive certain fees related to the sale. Product sales are
recognized at the time of shipment, while royalty income is recognized based
upon a percentage of reported sales by ComputerLand Corporation's franchisees.

Notes to Statement of Revenues and Operating Expenses (continued)

2. Allocated Expenses

Selling, general, and administrative expenses include allocations from
ComputerLand Corporation for expenses of the distribution centers and general
corporate overhead, including expenses for corporate functions and
administrative personnel. Such allocated expenses aggregated $27,340,000 and
$40,221,000 for the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The expenses have been allocated to the Division based upon such
factors as the ratio of the Division's shipments to total shipments by
ComputerLand Corporation and management's estimate of the time spent by shared
employees of ComputerLand Corporation. This is considered by management to be a
reasonable approximation of the costs that the Division would have had to incur
for the benefit received if it operated as an unaffiliated entity.

3. Subsequent Event

On September 23, 1993, ComputerLand Corporation signed a letter of
intent to sell certain assets and liabilities of the Division, including all
domestic franchise agreements, Datago distribution agreements, and the right to
the "ComputerLand" name and trademark within the United States to Merisel, Inc.
Concurrent with the proposed sale, ComputerLand Corporation will enter into a
distribution and services agreement with Merisel, Inc. Pursuant to this
agreement, ComputerLand Corporation will continue to supply product and provide
certain logistics and other support services to its former division for two
years following the closing date. ComputerLand Corporation will receive a
monthly distribution fee for such services.
