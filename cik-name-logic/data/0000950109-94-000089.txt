CORESTATES REPORTS RECORD OPERATING RESULTS FOR 1993

Philadelphia, January 19, 1994--CoreStates Financial Corp today reported 
record operating earnings for 1993. Full year operating income was $327,927,000
or $2.80 per share, up 23% from $262,404,000 or $2.27 per share in 1992.

Fourth quarter operating and net income was $85,312,000 or 73 cents per 
share, an increase of 24% from $69,107,000 or 59 cents per share in the fourth 
quarter of 1992.

The full year operating income reflected a return on average assets of 
1.44% and a return on average equity of 18.27%.

CoreStates also adopted two changes in accounting principles -- FAS 112, a 
new method of accounting for post-employment benefits such as short- and 
long-term disability pay, and FAS 115, a new method of classifying and 
accounting for investments in debt and equity securities.

The adoption of FAS 112 for 1993 resulted in a January 1, 1993 one-time, 
non-cash, after-tax charge of $13 million or 11 cents per share for the 
cumulative total post-employment benefits liability for employee services 
rendered in all previous years. In 1992

CoreStates also adopted FAS 106, a change in accounting for post-retirement 
benefits, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $81 million in that year. 
Income after the accounting changes was $314,917,000 in 1993 compared to 
$181,418,000 in 1992. Adoption of FAS 115 for 1993 had no effect on earnings, 
but did add to shareholders' equity.

Chairman Terrence A. Larsen said the year-to-year growth in both fourth 
quarter and full-year operating income reflected continued broad strength in 
CoreStates' basic businesses.

For the full year, net interest income was up more than 5% as a result of 
both moderate growth in average assets and a higher net financial margin. This 
reflected the strengthened loan demand that CoreStates experienced during much 
of 1993.

Non-interest income from fee-based services were higher in 1993 in three of
the company's four major service fee categories. The fourth category, debit and 
credit card fees, was not comparable year-to-year because a major source of such
fees in 1992, electronic payment services, was restructured in December 1992 as 
a joint venture with several other banking companies. Both the fees and the 
expenses of that business were replaced in CoreStates' income statement with 
CoreStates' share of joint venture income, plus preferred stock dividends. The 
total was $13.2 million for 1993.

While adoption of FAS 115 had no impact on earnings, it resulted in 
classification of approximately $550 million of investment securities in an 
"available for sale" category. These securities, formerly reported on the 
balance sheet at amortized cost, will be reported at market value under the new 
accounting principle, with the adjustment becoming part of equity. After related
tax effects, the change resulted in an increase of approximately $65 million in 
shareholders' equity.

Credit quality indicators improved sharply during 1993. Non-performing 
assets declined 14.7% from September 30, and at December 31 totaled $252 
million, or 1.1% of total assets and 1.5% of total loans plus real estate 
foreclosed. Non-performing assets had been

$387 million a year earlier.
Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $21.4 million, compared to
$32.2 million a year earlier. Full year charge-offs were $77.3 million, compared
to $130.2 million in 1992.
Reflecting the improved credit quality, the full-year provision for loan 
losses was down to $100.0 million in 1993 from $119.3 million in 1992. The loan 
loss reserve at December 31 was $348 million, or 173% of total non-performing 
loans.
CoreStates' consolidated total assets at year-end were $23.7 billion, 
including consolidated net loans of $16.4 billion. The comparable figures for a 
year earlier were $23.7 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively. Consolidated
deposits were $17.0 billion at December 31, 1993, and $17.3 billion a year
earlier. 
Shareholders' equity at December 31 was $1.96 billion, reflecting 8.3% of 
total assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 or core capital as a percentage 
of quarterly average assets) was 8.2% for the fourth quarter. Tier 1 capital at 
December 31 was 9.3% of risk-adjusted assets and total capital was 13.7% of 
risk-adjusted assets, well in excess of regulatory minimums of 4% and 8%, 
respectively.

(a) Reflects the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (FAS 112). As
required under FAS 112, CoreStates recognized the January 1, 1993
transitional liability of $20.0 million pre-tax, $13.0 million after-tax,
as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first
quarter of 1993.

(b) Reflects the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" (FAS 106). As permitted under FAS 106, CoreStates elected to
recognize immediately the January 1, 1992 transitional liability of $122.7
million pre-tax, $81.0 million after-tax, as the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 1992.
