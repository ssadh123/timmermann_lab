Item 5. Other Events.

On July 21, 1994, Metropolitan Financial Corporation ("MFC") 
and First Bank System, Inc. ("FBS") entered into an Agreement 
of Merger and Consolidation (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant 
to which MFC will be merged into FBS. In connection with the 
merger, each outstanding share of Common Stock of MFC will be 
converted into .6803 shares of Common Stock of FBS. In 
addition, each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock 
of MFC will be converted into the right to receive $27.00 
(plus accumulated and unpaid dividends) in cash and the 
outstanding warrants to purchase 249,100 shares of MFC Common 
Stock will be converted to warrants to purchase 169,462 shares 
of FBS Common Stock at $6.96 per share. The conversion ratio 
for the MFC Common Stock will be proportionately adjusted if 
the average closing price of FBS Common Stock during the 20 
trading days ending three business days before the 
stockholders' meetings scheduled to consider the merger is 
less than $33.00 or more than $40.50. Either party may 
terminate the merger if the average closing price of FBS 
Common Stock during the 20 trading days ending three business 
days before the stockholders' meetings scheduled to consider 
the merger is less than $29.50. The merger is intended to be 
tax free for federal income tax purposes to the holders of MFC 
Common Stock receiving shares of FBS Common Stock and to be 
accounted for as a "pooling of interests."

In connection with the Merger Agreement, MFC and FBS entered 
into a Stock Option Agreement pursuant to which FBS has the 
right to purchase up to 19.9% of MFC's outstanding Common 
Stock at a price of $24.66 per share if, under certain 
circumstances, MFC enters into (or the MFC Board of Directors 
recommends that the MFC stockholders approve or accept) an 
agreement to be merged with or acquired by a third party 
(including the acquisition of 20% or more of MFC's outstanding 
Common Stock) or a third party acquires 20% or more of the 
outstanding MFC Common Stock.

The merger is subject to various conditions, including the 
approval of the stockholders of MFC and FBS and required 
regulatory approvals.

The Merger Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement are 
attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2 and are incorporated 
herein by reference.

AGREEMENT OF MERGER AND CONSOLIDATION dated July 21, 
1994, by and between FIRST BANK SYSTEM, INC., a Delaware 
corporation ("FBS"), and METROPOLITAN FINANCIAL 
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("MFC").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of FBS and MFC have 
determined that it is in the best interests of FBS and MFC 
and their respective shareholders to consummate the merger 
of MFC with and into FBS as described in Article 1 (the 
"Merger");

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, all of the 
outstanding common stock, $0.01 par value, of MFC ("MFC 
Common Stock") will be converted into common stock, $1.25 
par value, of FBS ("FBS Common Stock") and all of the 
outstanding preferred stock, $0.01 par value, of MFC ("MFC 
Preferred Stock") will be converted into the right to 
receive cash, all on the terms and subject to the conditions 
set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, (a) MFC (i) owns all of the issued and 
outstanding capital stock of Metropolitan Federal Bank, fsb

all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the 
entities listed on Schedule A hereto (collectively, the 
"Indirect Nonbanking Subsidiaries"); and (c) Edina Realty, 
Inc. owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of 
the entities listed on Schedule B hereto (collectively, the 
"Edina Realty Subsidiaries" and together with the Bank, 
the Direct Nonbanking Subsidiaries and the Indirect 
Nonbanking Subsidiaries, the "Subsidiaries");

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to FBS's 
willingness to enter into this Agreement, FBS and MFC are 
entering into immediately after the execution and delivery 
hereof a Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date hereof 
(the "Stock Option Agreement") pursuant to which MFC shall 
grant to FBS an option to purchase shares of MFC Common 
Stock; and

WHEREAS, FBS and MFC desire that the Merger be made on 
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this 
Agreement and qualify as a reorganization within the meaning

amended (the "Code").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, 
warranties and covenants contained herein, the parties hereto 
agree as follows:
<PAGE>
ARTICLE 1

MERGER

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions 
set forth in Article 6, on a date mutually satisfactory to 
the parties as soon as practicable following receipt of all 
necessary regulatory approvals of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System ("FRB") and the Office of 
Thrift Supervision (the "OTS"), MFC will merge with and 
into FBS. FBS, in its capacity as the corporation surviving 
the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the 
"Surviving Corporation." The Merger will be effected 
pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effect provided 
in, Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the 
"DGCL").

1.1. Effect of Merger.

(a) On the Effective Date (as defined in 
Section 1.1(d)), MFC shall be merged with and into FBS, and 
the separate existence of MFC shall cease. The Charter (as 
defined Section 2.2) and Bylaws of FBS, as in effect 
immediately prior to the Effective Date, shall be the 
Charter and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until 
further amended as provided therein and in accordance with 
law. The directors of FBS immediately prior to the 
Effective Date will be the directors of the Surviving 
Corporation until their successors are elected and qualify.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and 
thereafter be responsible and liable for all the 
liabilities, debts, obligations and penalties of each of FBS 
and MFC.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and 
thereafter possess all the rights, privileges, immunities 
and franchises, of a public as well as of a private nature, 
of each of FBS and MFC; all property, real, personal and 
mixed, and all debts due on whatever account, and all and 
every other interest, of or belonging to or due to each of 
FBS and MFC, shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to 
and vested in the Surviving Corporation without further act 
or deed; and the title to any real estate or any interest 
therein, vested in FBS and MFC, shall not revert or be in 
any way impaired by reason of the Merger.

(d) To effect the Merger, the parties hereto will 
cause a certificate of merger relating to the Merger to be 
filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Merger 
shall be effective upon the filing of such certificate of 
merger. As used herein, the term "Effective Date" shall 
mean the date on which the certificate of merger is filed 
with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

1.2. Effect on Outstanding Shares of MFC Capital 
Stock.

To effectuate the Merger and subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement:

<PAGE>
(a) each issued and outstanding share of MFC Common 
Stock (other than shares held as treasury stock of MFC or 
shares held directly or indirectly by FBS, other than shares 
held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt 
previously contracted) shall be converted into .6803 shares 
of FBS Common Stock, and FBS shall issue to holders of MFC 
Common Stock .6803 shares of FBS Common Stock (the 
"Exchange Ratio"), subject to adjustment as provided in 
Section 1.3, in exchange for each such share of MFC Common 
Stock;

(b) all outstanding options and warrants to purchase 
shares of MFC Common Stock shall be exchanged for options 
and warrants to purchase FBS Common Stock, or shares of FBS 
Common Stock, as provided in Section 5.14;

(c) each issued and outstanding share of MFC Preferred 
Stock (other than shares as to which the holders thereof 
have asserted and not effectively withdrawn or otherwise 
lost their appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the 
DGCL ("Dissenters' Shares")) shall be converted into the 
right to receive $27.00 in cash, plus any accumulated and 
unpaid dividends on such shares of MFC Preferred Stock to, 
but excluding, the Effective Date calculated as set forth in 
the terms of such MFC Preferred Stock, without interest, 
from FBS (the "Preferred Consideration"), and FBS shall 
pay to holders of such MFC Preferred Stock the Preferred 
Consideration in exchange for each such share of MFC 
Preferred Stock;

(d) Dissenters' Shares shall be purchased and paid for 
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; and

(e) each share of MFC Common Stock held as treasury 
stock of MFC or held directly or indirectly by FBS, other 
than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction 
of a debt previously contracted, shall be canceled, retired 
and cease to exist, and no exchange or payment shall be made 
with respect thereof.

1.3. FBS Common Stock Adjustments.

(a) If the average of the closing prices of FBS Common 
Stock as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (the 
"NYSE") for the 20 trading days ending three business days 
prior to the last date of the meetings of shareholders 
scheduled to obtain the shareholder approvals referred to in 
Section 5.20 (the "Average Price") is less than $33.00, 
then, subject to Section 7.1(e), the Exchange Ratio will be 
adjusted by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the quotient 
of (i) $33.00 divided by (ii) the Average Price.

(b) If the Average Price is greater than $40.50, then 
the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Exchange Ratio by the quotient of (i) $40.50 divided by (ii) 
the Average Price.

(c) If, between the date hereof and the Effective 
Date, shares of FBS Common Stock shall be changed into a 
different number of shares or a different class of shares by 
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,

<PAGE> 
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a 
stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date 
within such period, then the number of shares of FBS Common 
Stock issued to holders of MFC Common Stock pursuant to this 
Agreement will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted 
so that the number of such shares of FBS Common Stock (or 
such class of shares into which shares of FBS Common Stock 
have been changed) that will be issued to holders of MFC 
Common Stock will equal the number of such shares that 
holders of MFC Common Stock would have received pursuant to 
such classification, recapitalization, split-up, 
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment had the 
record date therefor been immediately following the 
Effective Date. 

1.4. Rights of Holders of MFC Capital Stock; Capital 
Stock of FBS.

(a) On and after the Effective Date and until 
surrendered for exchange, each outstanding stock certificate 
which immediately prior to the Effective Date represented 
shares of MFC Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes, 
except as provided in Section 1.6(c), to evidence ownership 
of and to represent the number of whole shares of FBS Common 
Stock into which such shares of MFC Common Stock shall have 
been converted, and the record holder of such outstanding 
certificate shall, after the Effective Date, be entitled to 
vote the shares of FBS Common Stock into which such shares 
of MFC Common Stock shall have been converted on any matters
on which the holders of record of FBS Common Stock, as of 
any date subsequent to the Effective Date, shall be entitled 
to vote. In any matters relating to such certificates, FBS 
may rely conclusively upon the record of shareholders 
maintained by MFC containing the names and addresses of the 
holders of record of MFC Common Stock on the Effective Date.

(b) On and after the Effective Date and until 
surrendered for exchange, each outstanding stock certificate 
which immediately prior to the Effective Date represented 
shares of MFC Preferred Stock (other than Dissenters' 
Shares) shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the 
right to receive the Preferred Consideration from FBS. In 
any matters relating to such certificates, FBS may rely 
conclusively upon the record of shareholders maintained by 
MFC containing the names and address of the holders of 
record of MFC Preferred Stock on the Effective Date.

(c) On and after the Effective Date, each share of FBS 
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Date shall remain an issued and existing share of 
common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be 
affected by the Merger.

(d) On and after the Effective Date, FBS shall reserve 
a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares of FBS 
Common Stock for issuance in connection with the conversion 
of MFC Common Stock into FBS Common Stock as provided 
herein.

1.5. No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of FBS 
Common Stock, and no certificates representing such

<PAGE> 
fractional shares, shall be issued upon the surrender for 
exchange of certificates representing MFC Common Stock. In 
lieu of any fractional share, FBS shall pay to each holder 
of MFC Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to 
receive a fractional share of FBS Common Stock an amount of 
cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (a) the 
closing price per share of FBS Common Stock on the Effective 
Date times (b) the fractional share interest to which such 
holder would otherwise be entitled.

1.6. Procedure for Exchange of Stock.

(a) After the Effective Date, holders of certificates 
theretofore evidencing outstanding shares of MFC Common 
Stock or MFC Preferred Stock, upon surrender of such 
certificates to an exchange agent appointed by FBS (the 
"Exchange Agent"), shall be entitled to receive, (i) in 
the case of MFC Common Stock, (A) certificates representing 
the number of whole shares of FBS Common Stock into which 
shares of MFC Common Stock theretofore represented by the 
certificates so surrendered shall have been converted as 
provided in Section 1.2(a) and (B) cash payments in lieu of 
fractional shares, if any, as provided in Section 1.5, and 
(ii) in the case of MFC Preferred Stock, the Preferred 
Consideration. As soon as practicable after the Effective 
Date, FBS shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail appropriate 
and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify 
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title 
to the certificates theretofore representing shares of MFC 
Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock shall pass, only upon 
proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) 
to each holder of MFC Common Stock and MFC Preferred Stock 
of record as of the Effective Date advising such holder of 
the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for 
surrendering to the Exchange Agent outstanding certificates 
formerly evidencing MFC Common Stock in exchange for new 
certificates for FBS Common Stock and outstanding 
certificates formerly evidencing MFC Preferred Stock in 
exchange for the Preferred Consideration. FBS shall not be 
obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former 
holder of shares of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock 
is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder 
surrenders the certificate or certificates representing such 
shares for exchange as provided in such transmittal 
materials and this Section 1.6(a). In addition, 
certificates surrendered for exchange by any person deemed 
an "affiliate" of MFC (as defined in Section 5.10), shall 
not be exchanged for such consideration until FBS has 
received a written agreement from such person as provided in 
Section 5.10. Upon surrender, each certificate evidencing 
MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock shall be canceled.

(b) On the Effective Date, FBS shall deposit, or shall 
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for exchange 
in accordance with this Section 1.6, certificates 
representing the shares of FBS Common Stock and the cash in 
lieu of fractional shares and cash for payment of the 
Preferred Consideration (such certificates and cash, 
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be 
issued or paid by FBS pursuant to this Article 1 in 
connection with the Merger.

(c) Until outstanding certificates formerly 
representing MFC Common Stock are surrendered as provided in 

<PAGE>
Section 1.6(a), no dividend or distribution payable to 
holders of record of FBS Common Stock shall be paid to any 
holder of such outstanding certificates, but upon surrender 
of such outstanding certificates by such holder there shall 
be paid to such holder the amount of any dividends or 
distributions (without interest) theretofore paid with 
respect to such whole shares of FBS Common Stock, but not 
paid to such holder, and which dividends or distributions 
had a record date occurring on or subsequent to the 
Effective Date.

(d) After the Effective Date, there shall be no 
further registration of transfers on the records of MFC of 
outstanding certificates formerly representing shares of MFC 
Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock and, if a certificate 
formerly representing such shares is presented to MFC or 
FBS, it shall be forwarded to the Exchange Agent for 
cancellation and exchange for certificates representing 
shares of FBS Common Stock or the Preferred Consideration, 
as applicable, as herein provided.

(e) All shares of FBS Common Stock and cash for any 
fractional shares issued and paid upon the surrender for 
exchange of MFC Common Stock and all Preferred Consideration 
paid upon the surrender for exchange of MFC Preferred Stock 
in accordance with the above terms and conditions shall be 
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of 
all rights pertaining to such shares of MFC Common Stock and 
MFC Preferred Stock, respectively.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the 
proceeds of any investments thereof and any FBS Common Stock 
or any dividends or distributions thereon) that remains 
unclaimed by the holders of MFC Common Stock or MFC 
Preferred Stock for six months after the Effective Date 
shall be repaid to FBS. Any holders of MFC Common Stock or 
MFC Preferred Stock who have not theretofore complied with 
this Section 1.6 shall thereafter look only to FBS for 
payment of their shares of FBS Common Stock, cash in lieu of 
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions 
on the FBS Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share 
of MFC Common Stock or cash in an amount equal to the 
Preferred Consideration payable in respect of each share of 
MFC Preferred Stock, as the case may be, that such holder 
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each 
case, without any interest thereon. If outstanding 
certificates for shares of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred 
Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them not 
claimed prior to the date on which such payments would 
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any 
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to 
the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other 
applicable law, become the property of FBS (and to the 
extent not in its possession shall be paid over to it), free 
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously 
entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
none of FBS, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be 
liable to any former holder of MFC Common Stock or MFC 
Preferred Stock for any amount delivered to a public 
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat 
or similar laws.

(g) In the event any certificate for MFC Common Stock 
or MFC Preferred Stock shall have been lost, stolen or 

<PAGE>
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in 
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, 
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder 
thereof, (i) in the case of MFC Common Stock, such shares of 
FBS Common Stock and cash for fractional shares, if any, and 
(ii) in the case of MFC Preferred Stock, such Preferred 
Consideration, each as may be required pursuant to this 
Agreement; provided, however, that FBS may, in its 
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance and 
payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or 
destroyed certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it 
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made 
against FBS, MFC, the Exchange Agent or any other party with 
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen 
or destroyed.

(h) Any Dissenters' Shares shall not be converted into 
the Preferred Consideration or the right to receive the 
Preferred Consideration unless and until the holder of such

3.12. Properties.

(a) Each of MFC and the Subsidiaries owns good and 
marketable title to all of the real property and all of the 
personal property, fixtures, furniture and equipment 
reflected on the Latest Balance Sheets or acquired since the 
date thereof (other than real property reflected on the

<PAGE>
(b) Schedule 3.12(b) correctly sets forth a brief 
description, including the term, of each lease for real or 
personal property to which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries is 
a party as lessee with respect to (i) each individual lease 
which involves a remaining aggregate balance of lease 
payments payable of more than $100,000 or any group of 
related leases which involves a remaining aggregate balance 
of lease payments payable of more than $100,000, (ii) each 
lease which is a "material contract" within the meaning of 
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC or 
(iii) each lease which was not entered into in the ordinary 
course of business. MFC has delivered or made available to 
FBS complete and accurate copies of each of the leases 
described on Schedules 3.12(a) and 3.12(b), and none of such 
leases has been modified in any material respect, except to 
the extent that such modifications are disclosed by the 
copies delivered to FBS. The leases described on 
Schedules 3.12(a) and 3.12(b) are in full force and effect. 
MFC or one of the Subsidiaries (if lessee under such lease) 
has a valid and existing leasehold interest under each lease 
described on Schedule 3.12(b) for the term set forth 
therein. With respect to the leases described on 
Schedule 3.12(b), neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries is 
in default, nor, to the best knowledge of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries, are any of the other parties to any of such 
leases in default, and, to the best knowledge of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries, no circumstances (not in the control of MFC 
and the Subsidiaries) exist which could result in such a 
default under any of such leases. To the best knowledge of 
MFC and the Subsidiaries, there has been no cancellation, 
breach or anticipated breach by any other party to any lease 
described on Schedule 3.12(a) or 3.12(b). The rent rolls 
set forth on Schedules 3.12(a) and 3.12(b) are true and 
complete in all material respects and describe all 
occupancies and the material terms of each occupancy.

(c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(c), all of 
the buildings, fixtures, furniture and equipment necessary 
for the conduct of the business of MFC and each of the 
Subsidiaries are in good condition and repair, ordinary wear 
and tear excepted, and are usable in the ordinary course of 
business. Each of MFC and the Subsidiaries owns, or leases 
under valid leases, all buildings, fixtures, furniture, 
personal property, land improvements and equipment necessary 
for the conduct of its business as it is presently being 
conducted.

(d) Except as set forth in Schedules 3.12(d) and 
3.12(e), neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any of 
the buildings owned or leased by MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries is in violation of any applicable zoning 
ordinance or other law, regulation or requirement relating 
to the operation of any properties used in the operation of 
its business, including, without limitation, applicable 
environmental protection laws and regulations, which 
violations would, individually or in the aggregate, have a 
material adverse effect on the business, operations or 
financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries taken as a 
whole; and neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries has 
received any notice of any such violation, or of the 
existence of any condemnation proceeding with respect to any 
properties owned or leased by MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(d), no 
hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, pollutants or 

<PAGE>
contaminants have been deposited or disposed of in, on or 
under MFC's or any of the Subsidiaries' owned or leased 
properties (including properties owned, managed or 
controlled by the Bank in connection with its lending or 
fiduciary operations) during the period in which MFC or any 
of the Subsidiaries has owned, occupied, managed, controlled 
or operated such properties, except to the extent not 
material to the business, operations or financial conditions 
of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the best 
knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, no prior owners, 
occupants or operators of all or any part of MFC's or any of 
the Subsidiaries' owned or leased properties (including 
properties owned, managed or controlled by the Bank in 
connection with its lending or fiduciary operations) ever 
used such properties as a dump or gasoline service station, 
or deposited, disposed of or allowed to be deposited or 
disposed of in, on or under such properties any hazardous 
substances, hazardous wastes, pollutants or contaminants, 
except to the extent not material to the business, 
operations or financial conditions of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No asbestos or any material 
amount of ureaformaldehyde materials exists in or on any of 
MFC's or the Subsidiaries' owned or leased properties 
(including properties owned, managed or controlled by the 
Bank in connection with its lending or fiduciary 
operations), and no electrical transformers or capacitors, 
other than those owned by public utility companies, on such 
properties contain any PCBs. The representations contained 
in this Section 3.12(d) are not applicable to properties 
securing loans made by the Bank where the loans were made in 
the ordinary course of business and are fully performing in 
accordance with their terms.

(e) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(e), there are 
no aboveground or underground tanks (excluding hot water 
storage or propane tanks) located under, in or about, nor, 
to the best knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, have 
there ever been any such tanks located under, in or about, 
any of MFC's or any of the Subsidiaries' owned or leased 
properties (including properties owned, managed or 
controlled by the Bank in connection with its lending or 
fiduciary operations).

3.13. Tax Matters. Each of MFC, the Subsidiaries and 
all members of any consolidated, affiliated, combined or 
unitary group of which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries is a 
member have filed or will file all Tax (as hereinafter 
defined) and Tax information returns or reports required to 
be filed (taking into account permissible extensions) by 
them on or prior to the Effective Date, and have paid (or 
have accrued or will accrue, prior to the Effective Date, 
amounts for the payment of) all Taxes relating to the time 
periods covered by such returns and reports. The accrued 
taxes payable accounts for Taxes and provision for deferred 
income taxes, specifically identified as such, on the Latest 
Balance Sheets are sufficient for the payment of all unpaid 
Taxes of MFC and the Subsidiaries accrued for or applicable 
to all periods ended on or prior to the date of the Latest 
Balance Sheet or which may subsequently be determined to be 
owing with respect to any such period. Except as disclosed 
on Schedule 3.13, neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries 
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes 
or agreed to any extension of time with respect to an 
assessment or deficiency for Taxes. Each of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries has paid or will pay in a timely manner and as 

<PAGE>
required by law all Taxes due and payable by it or which it 
is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee 
or third party. All Taxes which will be due and payable, 
whether now or hereafter, for any period ending on, prior to 
or including the Effective Date shall have been paid by or 
on behalf of MFC and the Subsidiaries or shall be reflected 
on the books of MFC and the Subsidiaries as an accrued Tax 
liability determined in a manner which is consistent with 
past practices and the Latest Balance Sheets. No Tax 
returns of MFC or the Subsidiaries have been audited by any 
governmental authority other than as disclosed on 
Schedule 3.13; and, except as set forth on Schedule 3.13, 
there are no unresolved questions, claims or disputes 
asserted by any relevant taxing authority concerning the 
liability for Taxes of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries. 
Neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries has made an election 
under Section 341(f) of the Code for any taxable years not 
yet closed for statute of limitations purposes. No demand 
or claim has been made against MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes arising out of 
membership or participation in any consolidated, affiliated, 
combined or unitary group of which MFC or any of its 
Subsidiaries was at any time a member. For purposes of this 
Agreement, the term "Tax" shall mean any federal, state, 
local or foreign income, gross receipts, license, payroll, 
employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation, premium, 
property or windfall profits tax, environmental tax, customs 
duty, capital stock, franchise, employees' income 
withholding, foreign or domestic withholding, social 
security, unemployment, disability, workers' compensation, 
employment-related insurance, real property, personal 
property, sales, use, transfer, value added, alternative or 
add-on minimum or other tax, fee, assessment or charge of 
any kind whatsoever, including any interest, penalties or 
additions to, or additional amounts in respect of the 
foregoing, for each of MFC, the Subsidiaries and all members 
of any consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group 
of which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries is a member.

aggregate, (B) other contract which is a "material 
contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of

expenditures in excess of $50,000.

<PAGE>
(b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.14, (i) to the 
best knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, since the date 
of the Latest Balance Sheets, no customer has indicated that 
it will stop or decrease the rate of business done with MFC 
or any of the Subsidiaries (except for changes in the 
ordinary course of such business) that would, individually 
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
business, operations or financial condition of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) each of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be 
performed by it prior to the date hereof in connection with 
the contracts or commitments set forth on Schedule 3.14, and 
none of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries is in receipt of any 
claim of default under any contract or commitment set forth 
on Schedule 3.14, except for any failures to perform, 
breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the 
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, 
operations or financial condition of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (iii) none of MFC or any of 
the Subsidiaries has any present expectation or intention of 
not fully performing any material obligation pursuant to any 
contract or commitment set forth on Schedule 3.14; and 
(iv) to the best knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, 
there has been no cancellation, breach or anticipated breach 
by any other party to any contract or commitment set forth

anticipated breach which would not, individually or in the 
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, 
operations or financial condition of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.15. Litigation. Except as set forth on 
Schedule 3.15, there are no actions, suits, proceedings, 
orders or investigations pending or, to the best knowledge 
of MFC and the Subsidiaries, threatened against MFC or any 
of the Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, or before or by 
any federal, state or other governmental department, 
commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, 
domestic or foreign, except for such actions, suits, 
proceedings, orders or investigations which are not 
reasonably likely to result in losses or expenses in excess 
of $50,000. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15, none of 
the matters set forth on such Schedule, individually or in 
the aggregate, will have or could reasonably be expected to 
have a material adverse effect on the business, operations 
or financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as 
a whole.

Schedule 3.16, there are no claims for brokerage 
commissions, finders' fees, investment advisory fees or 
similar compensation in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement based on any arrangement, 
understanding, commitment or agreement made by or on behalf 
of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries.

3.17. Employees. Except as set forth on Schedule 
3.17, none of MFC's Chairman, Chief Administrative Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer or Senior Vice President, Human 
Resources, has any knowledge (without inquiry) of the 
announced or anticipated resignation of (i) any officer of 
MFC or any of the Subsidiaries or (ii) other employees at a 
rate substantially higher than the historical resignation 
rate for such employees of MFC or the Subsidiaries. Except 
as set forth on Schedule 3.17, MFC and each of the 
Subsidiaries has complied with all laws relating to the 

<PAGE>
employment of labor, including provisions thereof relating 
to wages, hours, equal opportunity, collective bargaining, 
non-discrimination and the payment of social security and 
other taxes, except where failure to so comply would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse 
effect on the business, operations or financial condition of 
MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this 
Section 3.18, unless the context clearly requires otherwise,

plans as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and all 
other benefit arrangements (including, without limitation, 
any employment agreement or any program, agreement, policy 
or commitment providing for insurance coverage of employees, 
workers' compensation, disability benefits, supplemental 
unemployment benefits, vacation benefits, retirement 
benefits, life, health, disability or accidental benefits) 
applicable to the employees of MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries, to which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries 
contribute, or which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries have 
committed to implement for their employees prior to the date 
of this Agreement. Unless the context clearly requires 
otherwise, "Plan" or "Plans" shall also include any 
similar program or arrangement maintained by any 
organization affiliated by ownership with MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries for which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries are or 
could be completely or partially liable for the funding or 
the administration either as a matter of law or by agreement 
but excluding customers of the trust departments of 
affiliates of MFC where there is no ownership affiliation 
between such customers and MFC.

(b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.18:

to all employees and former employees of MFC and the

benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of 
ERISA).

(ii) Funding. With respect to the Plans, (A) all 
required contributions which are due have either been made 
or properly accrued and (B) neither MFC nor any of the 
Subsidiaries is liable for any "accumulated funding 
deficiency" as that term is defined in Section 412 of the 
Code or any penalty or excise tax in connection therewith.

(iii) Plan Documents. With respect to all Plans 
sponsored or administered by MFC or any Subsidiary and with 
respect to any other Plan if available to MFC or any 
Subsidiary, MFC has furnished FBS with true and complete 
copies of (A) the most recent determination letter, if any, 
received by MFC or any of the Subsidiaries from the Internal

required to be filed for the three most recent fiscal Plan 
years, (C) the most recently prepared actuarial valuation 
report, if any, for each Plan, and (D) copies of the current 
Plan documents, trust agreements, insurance contracts and 
all related contracts and documents (including any material
employee communications) with respect to each Plan.

(iv) Defined Benefit Plans. Neither MFC nor any of 
the Subsidiaries nor any affiliate of MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries maintains or has maintained any Defined Benefit 
Plans for which MFC, any of the Subsidiaries or FBS have or 
will have any liability or, which if terminated, could 
result in any liability to MFC, the Subsidiaries or FBS 
under Title IV of ERISA. There are no unfunded vested 
liabilities (determined using the assumptions used by the 
Plan for funding and without regard to future salary 
increases) with respect to Defined Benefit Plans sponsored 
by MFC or any Subsidiary. There have been no reportable 
events under Section 4043 of ERISA (with respect to which 
the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived by 
regulation) with respect to any Defined Benefit Plan 
maintained by MFC or any of the Subsidiaries. No Defined 
Benefit Plan has been terminated that will result in a 
material liability by MFC or any of the Subsidiaries to the 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

(v) Multiemployer Plans. Neither MFC nor any of the 
Subsidiaries has any actual or potential liabilities under 
Sections 4201 or 4205 of ERISA for any complete or partial 
withdrawal from any multiemployer plan.

(vi) Fiduciary Breach; Claims. Neither MFC nor any of 
the Subsidiaries nor any of its directors, officers, 
employees or other "fiduciaries" (as such term is defined 
in Section 3(21) of ERISA) has committed any breach of 
fiduciary duty imposed by ERISA or any other applicable law 
with respect to the Plans which would subject MFC or any of 
the Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to any liability 

<PAGE>
under ERISA or any applicable law. There are no actions, 
suits or claims pending against MFC or any Subsidiary 
relating to benefits other than routine, uncontested claims 
for benefits.

(vii) Prohibited Transaction. Neither MFC nor any of 
the Subsidiaries nor any officer, director, employee, agent 
or fiduciary of any Plan has incurred any liability for any 
civil penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or 
Section 502(i) of ERISA.

(viii) Material Compliance With Law. All Plans have 
been consistently administered in accordance with their 
terms in all material respects. To the extent required 
either as a matter of law or to obtain the intended tax 
treatment and tax benefits, all Plans comply in all material 
respects with the requirements of ERISA and the Code. All 
Tax information returns or reports and all other required 
filings, disclosures and contributions have been made with 
respect to all Plans. No condition exists that limits the 
right of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries to amend or 
terminate any such Plan (except as provided in such Plans or 
limited under ERISA or the Code).

(ix) VEBA Funding. No Plan is funded in whole or in 
part through a voluntary employees' beneficiary association 
exempt from tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. The 
limitations under Sections 419 and 419A of the Code have 
been computed, all unrelated business income tax returns 
have been filed and appropriate adjustments have been made 
on all other Tax returns.

any of the Subsidiaries have actual or potential liability 
under current law for benefits after separation from 
employment other than (i) benefits under Plans described in 
clauses (A), (B) or (C) of Section 3.18(b)(i), and 
(ii) health care continuation benefits described in 
Section 4980B of the Code or Part G of Subtitle B of Title I 
of ERISA or any comparable provisions under the laws of any 
state.

(xi) Collective Bargaining. No Plan is maintained in 
whole or in part pursuant to collective bargaining.

(xii) Employee Status. No employee of MFC or any of 
the Subsidiaries is absent due to (A) a disability that 
currently entitles the employee to benefits under any long-
term disability plan sponsored by MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries or (B) military service leave of absence. All 
employees of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries are "at will" 
employees.

(xiii) Parachute Payments. No Plan requires or would 
result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of 
any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of 
Section 280G of the Code, and the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not be a 

<PAGE>
factor in causing payments to be made by FBS, MFC or any of 
the Subsidiaries that are not deductible (in whole or in 
part) under Section 280G of the Code.

3.19. Insurance. Schedule 3.19 hereto lists each 
insurance policy maintained by MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries with respect to its properties and assets. 
Prior to the date hereof, MFC has delivered to FBS complete 
and accurate copies of each of the insurance policies 
described on Schedule 3.19. All such insurance policies are 
in full force and effect, and neither MFC nor any of the 
Subsidiaries is in default with respect to its obligations 
under any of such insurance policies.

3.20. Affiliate Transactions. Except as set forth on 
Schedule 3.20, neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries, nor 
any executive officer or director of MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries, nor any member of the immediate family of any 
such officer or director (which for the purposes hereof 
shall mean a spouse, minor child or adult child living at 
the home of any such officer or director), nor any entity 
which any of such persons "controls" (within the meaning 
of Regulation O of the FRB), has any loan agreement, note or 
borrowing arrangement or any other agreement with MFC or any 
of the Subsidiaries (other than normal employment 
arrangements) or any interest in any property, real, 
personal or mixed, tangible or intangible, used in or 
pertaining to the business of MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries.

3.21. Compliance with Laws; Permits. Each of MFC and 
the Subsidiaries has complied in all respects with all 
applicable laws and regulations of foreign, federal, state 
and local governments and all agencies thereof which affect 
the business or any owned or leased properties of MFC or any 
of the Subsidiaries and to which MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries may be subject (including, without limitation, 
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the HOLA, 
the FDIA, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the 
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, the Fair Housing Act, 
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Federal Reserve 
Act, each as amended, and any other state or federal acts 
(including rules and regulations thereunder) regulating or 
otherwise affecting employee health and safety or the 
environment), except where failure to so comply would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse 
effect on the business, operations or financial condition of 
MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or MFC's ability 
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and no 
claims have been filed by any such governments or agencies 
against MFC or any of the Subsidiaries alleging such a 
violation of any such law or regulation which have not been 
resolved to the satisfaction of such governments or 
agencies. Each of MFC and the Subsidiaries holds all of the 
permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations of 
foreign, federal, state and local governmental agencies 
required for the conduct of its business, except where 
failure to obtain such authorizations would not, 
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse 
effect on the business, operations or financial condition of 
MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as whole, or the ability of 
MFC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 
Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.21, neither MFC nor any of 

<PAGE>
the Subsidiaries is subject to any cease and desist order, 
written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is 
a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, 
or is subject to any order or directive by, or is a 
recipient of any extraordinary supervisory agreement letter 
from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request 
of, federal or state governmental authorities charged with 
the supervision or regulation of savings banks, banks, 
savings and loan holding companies or bank holding companies 
or engaged in the insurance of bank deposits (collectively, 
the "Bank Regulators"), nor have any of MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries been advised by any Bank Regulator that it is 
contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the 
appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, 
directive, written agreement, memorandum of understanding, 
extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter, board 
resolutions or similar undertaking. Neither MFC nor any 
Subsidiary is subject to Section 32 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act.

3.22. Administration of Fiduciary Accounts. Each 
Subsidiary has properly administered, in all respects 
material and which could reasonably be expected to be 
material to the business, operations or financial condition 
of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all accounts 
for which it acts as a fiduciary, including but not limited 
to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, 
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or 
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the 
governing documents and applicable state and federal law and 
regulation and common law. Neither MFC, any Subsidiary, nor 
any director, officer or employee of MFC or any Subsidiary 
has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such 
fiduciary account which is material to or could reasonably 
be expected to be material to the business, operations or 
financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a 
whole, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account 
are true and correct in all material respects and accurately 
reflect the assets of such fiduciary account in all material 
respects.

3.23. Disclosure. The representations and warranties 
of MFC contained in this Agreement are true and correct in 
all material respects, and such representations and 
warranties do not omit any material fact necessary to make 
the statements contained therein, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 
There is no fact known to MFC and the Subsidiaries which has 
not been disclosed to FBS pursuant to this Agreement, the 
Schedules hereto and the MFC 10-K Reports and the MFC 10-Q 
Report, all taken together as a whole, which would have or 
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse 
effect on the business, operations or financial condition of 
MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability 
of MFC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

3.24. Prospectus/Proxy Statement. At the time the 
Prospectus/Proxy Statement is mailed to the shareholders of 
FBS and MFC in order to obtain approvals referred to in 
Section 5.9(a) and at all times subsequent to such mailing 
up to and including the times of such approvals, such 
Prospectus/Proxy Statement (including any supplements 
thereto), with respect to all information set forth therein 
relating to MFC (including the Subsidiaries) and its 
shareholders, MFC Common Stock, this Agreement, the Merger 

<PAGE>
and all other transactions contemplated hereby, will 
(a) comply in all material respects with applicable 
provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, and (b) not 
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to 
state a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light 
of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
misleading.

3.25. Pooling of Interests. Neither MFC nor any of 
the Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action 
which would disqualify the Merger as a "pooling of 
interests" for accounting purposes.

3.26. Regulatory Approvals. As of the date hereof, 
MFC is not aware of any reason that the regulatory approvals 
specified in Section 5.1 would not be obtained.

3.27. Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments.

(a) Schedule 3.27 sets forth a true, correct and 
complete list of all interest rate swaps, caps, floors and 
option agreements and other interest rate risk management 
arrangements to which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries is a 
party or by which any of their properties or assets may be 
bound. MFC has delivered or made available to FBS true, 
correct and complete copies of all such interest rate risk 
management agreements and arrangements.

(b) All interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option 
agreements and other interest rate risk management 
arrangements to which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries is a 
party or by which any of their properties or assets may be 
bound were entered into in the ordinary course of business 
and, to MFC's knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking 
practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of 
the Bank Regulators and with counterparties believed to be 
financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and 
binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their 
terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, 
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the 
rights of creditors generally and the availability of 
equitable remedies), and are in full force and effect. MFC 
and each of the Subsidiaries has duly performed in all 
material respects all of its obligations thereunder to the 
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and to 
MFC's knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or 
defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party 
thereunder.

"prior consultation" with respect to any action means 
advance notice of such proposed action and a reasonable 
opportunity to discuss such action in good faith prior

fiduciary duty to do so, (a) participate in any negotiations 
in connection with or in furtherance of any of the foregoing 
or (b) permit any person other than FBS and its

person with respect thereto, is made, and shall promptly 
provide FBS with such information regarding such proposal, 
offer, inquiry or contact as FBS may request.

5.6. Notification of Certain Matters. Each party 
shall give prompt notice to the other party of (a) the 
occurrence or failure to occur of any event or the discovery 
of any information, which occurrence, failure or discovery

or inaccurate when made at the Effective Date or at any time 
prior to the Effective Date and (b) any material failure of 
such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition 
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it 
hereunder.

and at reasonable hours to its properties and shall disclose 
and make available (together with the right to copy) to FBS 
and to the internal auditors, loan review officers, 
employees, attorneys, accountants and other representatives 
of FBS all books, papers and records relating to the assets, 
stock, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities 
of MFC and the Subsidiaries, including, without limitation,

information relating to the real and personal property), 
plans affecting employees, securities transfer records and

relating to other assets, business activities or prospects 
in which FBS may have a reasonable interest, including, 
without limitation, its interest in planning for integration 
and transition with respect to the business of MFC and the 
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the foregoing rights 
granted to FBS shall, whether or not and regardless of the 
extent to which the same are exercised, in no way affect the 
nature or scope of the representations, warranties and 
covenants of MFC set forth herein. In addition, MFC shall 
cause each of the Subsidiaries to instruct its officers, 
employees, counsel and accountants to be available for, and 
respond to any questions of, such FBS representatives at 
reasonable hours and with reasonable notice by FBS to such 
individuals, and to cooperate fully with FBS in planning for 
the integration of the business of MFC and the Subsidiaries 
with the business of FBS and its subsidiaries.

(b) FBS shall permit reasonable access to its 
properties and shall disclose and make available (together 

<PAGE>
with the right to copy) to MFC and to its representatives 
FBS's financial books and records, minute books of 
directors' and shareholders' meetings, organizational 
documents, bylaws, and filings with any regulatory 
authority; provided, however, that the foregoing rights 
granted to MFC shall, whether or not and regardless of the 
extent to which the same are exercised, in no way affect the 
nature or scope of the representations, warranties and 
covenants of FBS set forth herein. In addition, FBS shall 
instruct its officers, employees, counsel and accountants to 
be available for, and respond to reasonable questions of, 
representatives of MFC at reasonable hours and with 
reasonable notice by MFC to such individuals.

(c) All information furnished by MFC or FBS pursuant 
hereto shall be treated as the sole property of the party 
furnishing the information until the Effective Date, and, if 
the Effective Date shall not occur, the receiving party 
shall return to the party which furnished such information, 
or destroy, all documents or other materials (including 
copies thereof) containing, reflecting or referring to such 
information. In addition, the receiving party shall keep 
confidential all such information and shall not directly or 
indirectly use such information for any competitive or other 
commercial purpose. In the event that this Agreement shall 
terminate, neither party shall disclose, except as required 
by law or pursuant to the request of an administrative 
agency or other regulatory body, the basis or reason for 
such termination, without the consent of the other party. 
The obligation to keep such information confidential shall 
not apply to (i) any information which (A) was already in 
the receiving party's possession prior to the disclosure 
thereof to the receiving party by the party furnishing the 
information, (B) was then generally known to the public, 
(C) became known to the public through no fault of the 
receiving party or its representatives or (D) was disclosed 
to the receiving party by a third party not bound by an 
obligation of confidentiality or (ii) disclosures required

5.8. Filing of Tax Returns and Adjustments. 

(a) MFC, on behalf of MFC and each of the 
Subsidiaries, shall file (or cause to be filed) at their own 
expense, on or prior to the due date, all Tax returns, 
including all Plan returns and reports, for all Tax periods 
ending on or before the Effective Date where the due date 
for such returns or reports (taking into account valid 
extensions of the respective due dates) falls on or before 
the Effective Date; provided, however, that neither MFC nor 
any of the Subsidiaries shall file any such Tax returns, or 
other returns, elections or information statements with 
respect to any liabilities for Taxes (other than federal, 
state or local sales, use, withholding or employment tax 
returns or statements), or consent to any adjustment or 
otherwise compromise or settle any matters with respect to 
Taxes, without prior consultation with FBS; provided, 
further, that neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries shall 
make any election or take any other discretionary position 
with respect to Taxes, in a manner inconsistent with past 
practices, without the prior written approval of FBS, which 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event 
the granting or withholding of such approval by FBS results 
in additional Taxes owing for any Tax period ending on or 

<PAGE>
before the Effective Date, liability for such additional 
Taxes shall not cause any representation of MFC relating to 
Taxes to be untrue. MFC shall provide FBS with a copy of 
appropriate workpapers, schedules, drafts and final copies 
of each federal and state income Tax return or election of 
MFC and each of the Subsidiaries (including returns of all 
Plans) at least seven days before filing such return or 
election and shall reasonably cooperate with any request by 
FBS in connection therewith. 

(b) FBS, in its sole and absolute discretion, will 
file (or cause to be filed) all Tax returns of MFC and each 
of the Subsidiaries due after the Effective Date. After the 
Effective Date, FBS, in its sole and absolute discretion and 
to the extent permitted by law, shall have the right to 
amend, modify or otherwise change all Tax returns of MFC and 
each of the Subsidiaries for all Tax periods.

be issued to holders of MFC Common Stock and of options 
under the MFC Stock Option Plans (as defined in Section 
5.14(a)) in connection with the Merger with the SEC and with 
applicable state securities authorities, the parties hereto 
shall cooperate in the preparation of an appropriate 
registration statement (such registration statement, 
together with all and any amendments and supplements 
thereto, being herein referred to as the "Registration 
Statement"), which shall include a prospectus/joint proxy 
statement satisfying all applicable requirements of the 1933 
Act, the 1934 Act, applicable state securities laws and the 
rules and regulations thereunder (such prospectus/joint 
proxy statement, together with any and all amendments or 
supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the 
"Prospectus/Proxy Statement").

(b) FBS shall furnish such information concerning FBS 
as is necessary in order to cause the Prospectus/Proxy 
Statement, insofar as it relates to FBS, to be prepared in 
accordance with Section 5.9(a). FBS agrees promptly to 
advise MFC if at any time prior to the FBS or MFC 
shareholders' meetings any information provided by FBS in 
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement becomes incorrect or 
incomplete in any material respect, and to provide the 
information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission.

(c) MFC shall furnish FBS with such information 
concerning MFC and the Subsidiaries as is necessary in order 
to cause the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, insofar as it 
relates to MFC and the Subsidiaries, to be prepared in 
accordance with Section 5.9(a). MFC agrees promptly to 
advise FBS if at any time prior to the FBS or MFC 
shareholders' meetings any information provided by MFC in 
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement becomes incorrect or 
incomplete in any material respect, and to provide FBS with 
the information needed to correct such inaccuracy or 
omission.

<PAGE>

(d) FBS shall promptly file the Registration Statement 
with the SEC and applicable state securities agencies. FBS 
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Registration 
Statement to become effective under the 1933 Act and 
applicable state securities laws at the earliest practicable 
date. MFC authorizes FBS to utilize in the Registration 
Statement the information concerning MFC and the 
Subsidiaries provided to FBS for the purpose of inclusion in 
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. MFC shall have the right to 
review and comment on the form of proxy statement included 
in the Registration Statement. FBS shall advise MFC 
promptly when the Registration Statement has become 
effective and of any supplements or amendments thereto, and 
FBS shall furnish MFC with copies of all such documents. 
Prior to the Effective Date or the termination of this 
Agreement, each party shall consult with the other with 
respect to any material (other than the Prospectus/Proxy 
Statement) that might constitute a "prospectus" relating 
to the Merger within the meaning of the 1933 Act.

(e) FBS shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be 
delivered to MFC a letter relating to the Registration 
Statement from Ernst & Young, FBS's independent auditors, 
dated a date within two business days before the date on 
which the Registration Statement shall become effective and 
addressed to MFC, in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to MFC and customary in scope and substance for 
letters delivered by independent public accountants in 
connection with registration statements similar to the 
Registration Statement.

(f) MFC shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be 
delivered to FBS a letter relating to the Registration 
Statement from Ernst & Young, MFC's independent auditors, 
dated a date within two business days before the date on 
which the Registration Statement shall become effective and 
addressed to FBS, in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to FBS and customary in scope and substance for 
letters delivered by independent public accountants in 
connection with registration statements similar to the 
Registration Statement.

(g) FBS shall bear (i) the costs of all SEC filing 
fees with respect to the Registration Statement and the 
costs of qualifying the shares of FBS Common Stock under 
state blue sky laws to the extent necessary and (ii) all 
printing and mailing costs in connection with the 
preparation and mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to 
FBS shareholders. MFC shall bear all printing and mailing 
costs in connection with the preparation and mailing of the 
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to MFC shareholders. FBS and 
MFC shall each bear their own legal and accounting expenses 
in connection with the Registration Statement.

5.10. Affiliate Letters. MFC shall use its best 
efforts to obtain and deliver to FBS at least 31 days prior 
to the Effective Date a signed representation letter 
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each 
shareholder of MFC who may reasonably be deemed an 
"affiliate" of MFC within the meaning of such term as used 
in Rule 145 under the 1933 Act and for purposes of 
qualifying for pooling of interests accounting treatment for 
the Merger. FBS may place appropriate legends on the stock 
certificates of affiliates of MFC. 

<PAGE>

5.11. Establishment of Accruals. If requested by FBS 
prior to March 1, 1995, prior to the public release of 
financial results for MFC's 1994 fiscal year (or, if 
earlier, the business day immediately prior to the Effective 
Date), MFC shall, consistent with generally accepted 
accounting principles, establish for such fiscal year such 
additional accruals and reserves as may be necessary to 
conform MFC's accounting and credit loss reserve practices 
and methods to those of FBS (as such practices and methods 
are to be applied to MFC from and after the Effective Date) 
and reflect FBS's plans with respect to the conduct of MFC's 
business following the Merger and to provide for the costs 
and expenses relating to the consummation by MFC of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, 
however, that MFC shall not be required to take such action 
unless (A) FBS certifies in writing that it has no reason to 
believe that all conditions to FBS's obligation to 
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 
set forth in Article 6 hereof will not be satisfied or 
waived; and (B) MFC shall have no reasonable basis for 
believing that all the conditions to MFC's obligation to 
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 
will not be satisfied. In the event that MFC shall not be 
obligated to establish the additional accruals and reserves 
referred to in the preceding sentence prior to March 1, 
1995, and thereafter FBS shall request that MFC establish 
such accruals and reserves and the conditions set forth in 
clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding sentence are satisfied, 
MFC shall establish such accruals and reserves for a period 
subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no 
accrual or reserve made by MFC or the Bank pursuant to this 
Section 5.11, or any litigation or regulatory proceeding 
arising out of any such accrual or reserve, or any other 
effect on MFC or the Bank resulting from MFC's compliance 
with this Section 5.11, shall constitute or be deemed to be 
a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any 
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other 
provisions of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in 
determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to 
satisfy shall have occurred.

5.12. Employee Matters. 

(a) General. Subject to the following agreements, FBS 
shall have the right to continue, amend or terminate any of 
the Plans (as defined in Section 3.18) in accordance with 
the terms thereof and subject to any limitation arising 
under applicable law. Until FBS shall take such action, 
however, such Plans shall continue in force for the benefit 
of present and former employees of MFC or the Subsidiaries 
who have any present or future entitlement to benefits under 
any of the Plans ("MFC Employees").

(b) MFC Plans.

(I) MFC 401(k) Plan. After the Effective Date, 
FBS will terminate the accrual of benefits under the MFC 
401(k) plans listed on Schedule 3.18(b)(i)(B) and sponsored 
by MFC or any Subsidiary not more than two years after the 
Effective Date and will take such actions as may be 

<PAGE>
necessary to cause the assets and liabilities of the MFC 
401(k) plans to be merged with and into the FBS 401(k) plan. 
As of the Effective Date, FBS shall take such action as may 
be necessary to amend the MFC 401(k) plans to provide that 
with respect to MFC Employees who are participants in the 
MFC 401(k) plans and who are employees of MFC as of the 
Effective Date, their accounts under such plans as of the 
Effective Date shall be fully vested as of the Effective 
Date. Benefits accruing between the Effective Date and the 
date on which the accrual of benefits is terminated shall be 
fully and immediately vested as of that time. Distributions 
shall not be permitted from the MFC 401(k) plans merely 
because of the discontinuance of accruals or the transfer of 
assets and liabilities.

(ii) MFC Directors' Retirement Plan. MFC shall 
calculate and pay in cash on the Effective Date all amounts 
reasonably estimated to be owing to any MFC director 
pursuant to the MFC Directors' Retirement Plan, including 
any estimated "gross up" payment payable as provided 
therein. To the extent that any such gross up payment 
remains payable after the Effective Date, FBS hereby 
acknowledges that it will promptly pay such amounts in full 
in accordance with the terms of such plan.

(iii) Change in Control Plans. Prior to the 
Effective Date, MFC shall amend the Change in Control Plans 
as set forth in Exhibit B hereto, and FBS hereby agrees to 
such amendments. FBS acknowledges that any employment 
agreement with an executive officer previously disclosed to 
it does not constitute a "severance plan" for purposes of 
such plans. 

(iv) MFC Bonus Plans. On or prior to December 
31, 1994, MFC shall pay all bonuses accrued in 1994 by MFC 
Employees under the MFC bonus plans disclosed to FBS.

(v) MFC Defined Benefit Plan. Not more than two 
(2) years after the Effective Date, FBS will terminate the 
accrual of benefits under the MFC qualified defined benefit 
pension plan and will take such actions as may be necessary 
to cause the assets and liabilities of the MFC qualified 
defined benefit pension plan to be merged with and into the 
FBS Personal Retirement Account. As of the Effective Date, 
FBS shall take such action as may be necessary to amend the 
MFC qualified defined benefit pension plan to provide that 
with respect to MFC Employees who are participants in the 
MFC qualified defined benefit pension plan and who are 
employees of MFC as of the Effective Date, their accrued 
benefits under such plan as of the Effective Date shall be 
fully vested as of the Effective Date.

(c) FBS Plans.

(i) FBS CAP (401(k)) Plan. After the Effective 
Date, FBS shall take such actions as may be necessary to 
cause eligible MFC Employees to become qualified to 
participate in the FBS Capital Accumulation Plan ("CAP") 

<PAGE>
concurrent with the date that FBS causes accruals to cease 
under the MFC 401(k) plan. All service with MFC and any of 
the Subsidiaries (whether before or after the Effective 
Date) shall be recognized under the CAP for eligibility and 
vesting purposes but shall not be recognized for 
contribution and allocation purposes. FBS shall take such 
actions as may be necessary to cause the CAP to accept 
transfers of assets and liabilities from the MFC 401(k) 
plan.

(ii) FBS Defined Benefit Plan. Upon the 
cessation of accruals under any MFC Defined Benefit Plan, 
FBS shall take such actions as may be necessary to cause 
eligible MFC Employees to be qualified to participate in any 
qualified defined benefit plan generally available at the 
time to similarly situated employees of FBS or an affiliate 
of FBS. All service with MFC or any of the Subsidiaries and 
their predecessors, to such extent taken into account for 
purposes of the MFC Defined Benefit Plan (whether before or 
after the Effective Date) shall be recognized under the FBS 
plan for eligibility and vesting purposes but shall not be 
required to be recognized for any other purpose.

(iii) Welfare and Other Benefits. FBS shall use 
its best efforts to cause any transition by MFC Employees 
from the welfare and other generally applicable benefit 
plans and practices of MFC or its affiliates not otherwise 
expressly dealt with in this Section 5.12 to FBS plans and 
practices to be effected in a manner that does not result in 
a significant financial detriment to the MFC Employees other 
than any such financial detriment as a result of higher 
premium costs in the FBS plan which are generally applicable 
to other similarly situated employees of FBS and its 
affiliates or to the absence of any FBS counterpart for a 
particular MFC plan or practice.

(d) Successor Status; Further Assurances. FBS hereby 
expressly assumes and agrees to perform or cause to be 
performed all of the obligations of "successors" under the 
terms of the MFC Broad-Based Change in Control Severance Pay 
Plan, as amended, the MFC Senior Management Change in 
Control Severance Pay Plan, as amended, and the MFC 
Executive Management Change in Control Severance Pay Plan, 
as amended (the "Change in Control Plans"), and the MFC 
Directors' Retirement Plan.

(e) Limitation on Enforcement. This Section 5.12 is an 
agreement solely between MFC and the Subsidiaries and FBS. 
Nothing in this Section 5.12, whether express or implied, 
confers upon any employee of MFC, any of the Subsidiaries or 
FBS or any other person, any rights or remedies, including, 
but not limited to: (i) any right to employment or recall, 
(ii) any right to continued employment for any specified 
period, or (iii) any right to claim any particular 
compensation, benefit or aggregate of benefits, of any kind 
or nature whatsoever, as a result of this Section 5.12.

5.13. Pooling of Interests; Tax Treatment. Neither 
MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries nor FBS shall take any 

<PAGE>
action which would disqualify the Merger as a "pooling of 
interests" for accounting purposes or as a 
"reorganization" that would be tax free to the 
shareholders of MFC pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Code.

5.14. Stock Options and Warrants.

(a) Stock Option Plans. In the event that each option 
outstanding or to be outstanding on the Effective Date under 
the MFC 1982 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the MFC 1990 
Stock Option Plan, the MFC 1993 Non-Employee Director Stock 
Option Plan and the MFC 1993 Stock Incentive Plan 
(collectively, the "MFC Stock Option Plans") is converted 
into a right to receive in lieu of all other rights under 
such option (and each such option thereafter is terminated 
and canceled), shares of FBS Common Stock with a value as of 
the Effective Date equal to the "fair value" of such 
option as determined by an independent third party expert to 
be mutually selected by FBS and MFC, FBS will, as of the 
Effective Date, issue in respect of such option shares of 
FBS Common Stock having an Average Price equal to such 
"fair value." In the event that each such option is not 
so converted, then, at the Effective Date, such option shall 
be assumed by FBS and shall thereafter be deemed to 
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and 
conditions as were applicable under such option, the same 
number of shares of FBS Common Stock as the holder of such 
option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the 
Merger had such holder exercised such option in full 
immediately prior to the Effective Date, at a price per 
share equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the 
shares of MFC Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to 
such option divided by (y) the number of full shares of FBS 
Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such option; 
provided, however, that in the case of any option to which 
Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its 
qualification under Section 422 of the Code ("incentive 
stock options"), the option price, the number of shares 
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and 
conditions of exercise of such options shall be determined 
in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. In 
addition, MFC will use its best efforts to cause all of the 
options outstanding and vested under the MFC Stock Option 
Plans as of December 31, 1994 to be exercised in full on or 
prior to such date.

(b) Employee Stock Purchase Plans. At the Effective
Date, each outstanding option issued pursuant to the MFC
Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the Edina Realty Sales 
Associate Stock Purchase Plan shall be deemed to constitute 
an option to acquire FBS Common Stock on the same terms and 
conditions as theretofore applicable, except that the 
exercise price per share and the number of shares of stock 
for which such option is exercisable shall be adjusted as 
appropriate in light of the Merger and the Exchange Ratio in 
order to prevent any diminution of the value of such options 
or the rights of the participants. 

(c) MFC Warrants. On the Effective Date, FBS shall 
execute a supplemental warrant agreement to the Warrant 
Agreement dated as of November 20, 1990 (the "MFC Warrant 
Agreement") between MFC and American Stock Transfer and 
Trust Company, as Warrant Agent, as provided in 
Section 10(I) of the Warrant Agreement, and all outstanding 
warrants of MFC (the "MFC Warrants") issued pursuant to 
such Warrant Agreement shall be assumed by FBS. Each MFC 

<PAGE>
Warrant shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, 
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under 
such MFC Warrant, the same number of shares of FBS Common 
Stock as the holder of such MFC Warrant would have been 
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder 
exercised such option in full immediately prior to the 
Effective Date, at a price per share equal to (x) the 
aggregate exercise price for the shares of MFC Common Stock 
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such MFC Warrant divided 
by (y) the number of full shares of FBS Common Stock deemed 
purchasable pursuant to such MFC Warrant. FBS shall take all 
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a 
sufficient number of shares of FBS Common Stock for delivery 
upon exercise of MFC Warrants assumed by it in accordance 
with this Section 5.14. FBS shall use its best efforts to 
register the MFC Warrants and the underlying FBS Common Stock 
under the 1933 Act as of the Effective Date and to maintain 
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration 
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or 
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such MFC Warrants 
remain outstanding.

5.15. Indemnification and Insurance. 

(a) From and after the Effective Date, FBS shall 
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, 
or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who 
becomes prior to the Effective Date, an officer, director or 
employee of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries (the 
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, 
damages, costs, expenses (including attorney's fees), 
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in 
settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written 
consent of FBS, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, 
proceeding or investigation (a "Claim") in which an 
Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party 
or a witness based in whole or in part on or arising in 
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was 
a director, officer or employee of MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries if such Claim pertains to any matter or fact 
arising, existing or occurring prior to the Effective Date 
(including, without limitation, the Merger and other 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), regardless of 
whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or 
after the Effective Date (the "Indemnified Liabilities") 
to the full extent permitted under applicable Delaware or 
federal law as of the date hereof or as amended prior to the 
Effective Date and under MFC's Charter and Bylaws as in 
effect on the date hereof (and FBS shall pay expenses in 
advance of the final disposition of any such action or 
proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent 
permitted by law and under such Charter or Bylaws, upon 
receipt of any undertaking required by such Charter, Bylaws 
or applicable law). Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim 
indemnification under this Section 5.15(a), upon learning of 
any Claim, shall notify FBS (but the failure so to notify 
FBS shall not relieve it from any liability which FBS may 
have under this Section 5.15(a) except to the extent such 
failure prejudices FBS) and shall deliver to FBS any 
undertaking required by such Charter, Bylaws or applicable 
law. FBS shall use its best efforts to assure, to the 
extent permitted under applicable law, that all limitations 
of liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as 
provided in the MFC Charter and Bylaws, as in effect as of 

<PAGE>
the date hereof, with respect to claims or liabilities 
arising from facts or events existing or occurring prior to 
the Effective Date (including, without limitation, the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), shall survive 
the Merger. The obligations of FBS described in this 
Section 5.15(a) shall continue in full force and effect, 
without any amendment thereto, for a period of not less than 
five years from the Effective Date; provided, however, that 
all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim 
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the 
final disposition of such Claim; and provided further that 
nothing in this Section 5.15(a) shall be deemed to modify 
applicable Delaware law regarding indemnification of former 
officers and directors. Nothing in this Section 5.15(a) 
shall affect the obligations to be assumed in the Merger by 
FBS to indemnify former directors and officers of MFC or the 
Bank pursuant to the terms of the indemnification agreements 
in effect as of the date hereof and as disclosed to FBS in 
Schedule 3.14.

(b) From and after the Effective Date, the directors, 
officers and employees of MFC and the Subsidiaries who 
become directors, officers or employees of FBS or any of its 
subsidiaries, except for the indemnification rights set 
forth in Section 5.15(a), shall have indemnification rights 
with prospective application only. The prospective 
indemnification rights shall consist of such rights to which 
directors, officers and employees of FBS are entitled under 
the provisions of the Charter or similar governing documents 
of FBS and its subsidiaries, as in effect from time to time 
after the Effective Date, as applicable, and provisions of 
applicable law as in effect from time to time after the 
Effective Date.

(c) The obligations of FBS provided under 
Sections 5.15(a) and 5.15(b) are intended to benefit, and be 
enforceable against FBS directly by, the Indemnified 
Parties, and shall be binding on all respective successors 
of FBS.

(d) For a period of three years after the Effective 
Date, FBS shall use its best efforts to provide that portion 
of directors' and officers' liability insurance that serves 
to reimburse officers and directors of MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries (as opposed to FBS or MFC) with respect to 
claims against such officers and directors arising from 
facts or events which occurred before the Effective Date of 
at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms 
and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage 
currently provided by MFC; provided, however, that the 
annual premiums for such coverage will not exceed 200% of 
the annual premiums currently paid by MFC for such coverage; 
provided, further, that officers and directors of MFC or any 
Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide 
customary representations and warranties to FBS's insurance 
carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance; and 
provided, further, that such coverage will have a single 
aggregate for such three-year period in an amount not less 
than the annual aggregate of such coverage currently 
provided by MFC.

5.16. Edina Realty Litigation Matters. MFC shall 
provide FBS regular updates on the status of the Edina 
Realty Litigation Matters, shall notify FBS of any 

<PAGE>
developments with respect to such matters, and shall allow 
FBS to attend all settlement negotiations or other meetings 
relating to the settlement or other disposition of such 
matters.

5.17. FBS SEC Reports. FBS shall continue to file all 
reports with the SEC necessary to permit the shareholders of 
MFC who are "affiliates" of MFC (within the meaning of 
such term as used in Rule 145 under the 1933 Act) to sell 
the FBS Common Stock received by them in connection with the 
Merger pursuant to Rules 144 and 145(d) under the 1933 Act 
if they would otherwise be so permitted. After the 
Effective Date, FBS will file with the SEC reports and other 
materials required by the federal securities laws on a 
timely basis.

5.18. SEC Reports. Each of FBS and MFC agree to 
provide to the other party copies of all reports and other 
documents filed with the SEC by it between the date hereof 
and the Effective Date within five days after the date such 
reports or other documents are filed with the SEC.

5.19. Stock Exchange Listing. FBS shall use its best 
efforts to list on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to 
official notice of issuance, the shares of FBS Common Stock 
to be issued to the holders of MFC Common Stock in the 
Merger.

5.20. Shareholder Approvals. Each of FBS and MFC 
shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of 
voting upon this Agreement and the Merger, and shall 
schedule such meeting based on consultation with the other 
party. The Board of Directors of each of FBS and MFC shall 
recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and use 
its best efforts (including, without limitation, soliciting 
proxies for such approvals) to obtain such shareholder 
approvals, unless the Board of Directors of either party 
determines, after receipt of a written opinion of counsel to 
such party (a copy of which shall be delivered to the other 
party), that recommending such approvals or using its best 
efforts to obtain such shareholder approvals would be a 
breach of its fiduciary duties.

5.21. FBS Board of Directors; Consulting Agreement.

(a) Following the Effective Date, FBS shall use its 
best efforts to (i) secure the election of Norman M. Jones 
to the FBS Board of Directors for a term of at least three 
years and (ii) appoint Mr. Jones as Chairman of the Board of 
Directors of the Bank, or its successor following the 
Merger, for at least three years, subject to any applicable 
regulatory requirements.

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, FBS shall enter into 
a consulting agreement with Mr. Jones, containing customary 
terms and conditions, engaging Mr. Jones for a three-year 
period following the Effective Date as an independent 
consultant to assist FBS in identifying and contacting, on 
behalf of FBS, potential financial institution acquisition 
candidates as requested from time to time by FBS.

(c) FBS shall pay Mr. Jones, for all of the services 
rendered by Mr. Jones pursuant to this Section 5.21, total 
compensation equal to $200,000 annually.

<PAGE>

(d) FBS acknowledges that, on the Effective Date, 
there shall exist a "termination" of Mr. Jones employment 
with MFC under the terms of the MFC Executive Management 
Change in Control Severance Pay Plan and FBS shall pay all 
benefits payable to Mr. Jones pursuant to the terms of such 
plan upon such termination.

ARTICLE 6

CONDITIONS

6.1. Conditions to Obligations of Each Party. The 
respective obligations of each party to effect the 
transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the 
fulfillment at or prior to the Effective Date of the 
following conditions:

(a) Regulatory Approval. Regulatory approval for the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall 
have been obtained from the FRB, the OTS and any other 
governmental authority from whom approval is required, the 
applicable waiting periods, if any, under the HSR Act shall 
have expired or been terminated, and all other statutory or 
regulatory waiting periods shall have lapsed. None of such 
approvals shall contain any conditions or restrictions that 
FBS reasonably believes will materially restrict or limit 
the business or activities of FBS, MFC or the Subsidiaries 
or have a material adverse effect on, or would be reasonably 
likely to have a material adverse effect on, the business, 
operations or financial condition of FBS and its 
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on the one hand, or MFC and 
the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on the other hand. FBS 
acknowledges that a requirement to divest control of Edina 
Realty, Inc. following the Merger would not, in and of 
itself, constitute a failure of the condition in this 
Section 6.1(a).

(b) No Injunction. No injunction or other order 
entered by a state or federal court of competent 
jurisdiction shall have been issued and remain in effect 
which would impair the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby.

(c) No Prohibitive Change of Law. There shall have 
been no law, statute, rule or regulation, domestic or 
foreign, enacted or promulgated which would materially 
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated 
hereby.

(d) No Termination. No party hereto shall have 
terminated this Agreement as permitted herein.

(e) Registration Statement. The Registration 
Statement shall have been declared effective and shall not 
be subject to a stop order of the SEC, and, if the offer and 

<PAGE>
sale of FBS Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to this 
Agreement is required to be registered under the securities 
laws of any state, the Registration Statement shall not be 
subject to a stop order of securities commission in such 
state.

(f) Federal Tax Opinion. An opinion of Oppenheimer 
Wolff & Donnelly shall have been obtained with respect to 
the Merger, based on customary reliance and subject to 
customary qualifications, to the effect that for federal 
income tax purposes:

(i) The Merger will qualify as a 
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code;

(ii) No gain or loss will be recognized by any 
MFC shareholder (except in connection with the receipt 
of cash) upon the exchange of MFC Common Stock for FBS 
Common Stock in the Merger;

(iii) The basis of the FBS Common Stock received 
by a MFC shareholder who exchanges MFC Common Stock for 
FBS Common Stock will be the same as the basis of the 
MFC Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefore 
(subject to any adjustments required as the result of 
receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share of FBS 
Common Stock);

(iv) The holding period of the FBS Common Stock 
received by a MFC shareholder receiving FBS Common 
Stock will include the period during which the MFC 
Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor was held 
(provided that the MFC Common Stock of such MFC 
shareholder was held as a capital asset at the 
Effective Date); and

(v) Cash received by a MFC shareholder in lieu of 
a fractional share interest of FBS Common Stock will be 
treated as having been received as a distribution in 
full payment in exchange for the fractional share 
interest of FBS Common Stock which he would otherwise 
be entitled to receive, and will qualify as capital 
gain or loss (assuming the MFC Common Stock was a 
capital asset in his hands at the Effective Date).

Such opinion shall be delivered on and dated as of the 
Effective Date and on and as of such earlier date as may be 
required by the SEC in connection with the Registration 
Statement.

(g) The FBS Common Stock to be issued to holders of 
MFC Common Stock in the Merger shall have been approved for 
listing on the NYSE on official notice of issuance.

representations and warranties of FBS set forth in 
Article 2 shall have been true and correct as of the

material respects have performed each obligation and 
agreement and complied with each covenant to be

Executive Vice President and General Counsel of FBS, 
based on customary reliance and subject to customary 
qualifications, to the effect that:

laws of the State of Delaware. FBS is registered 
as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding 
Company Act.

(ii) FBS has the corporate power to 
consummate the transactions on its part 
contemplated by this Agreement. FBS has taken all 
requisite corporate action to authorize this

executed and delivered by FBS and constitutes the 
valid and binding obligation of FBS enforceable in 
accordance with its terms, subject as to the 
enforcement of remedies to applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, moratorium and other laws affecting 
the rights of creditors generally and to judicial 
limitations on the enforcement of the remedy of 
specific performance.

(iii) The execution and delivery of this 
Agreement by FBS and the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated hereby will not 
constitute a breach, default or violation 
under its Charter or Bylaws or, to his knowledge, 
(A) any agreement, arrangement or understanding to 
which FBS is a party, (B) any license, franchise 
or permit or (C) any law, regulation, order, 
judgment or decree.

of, or filing with, any public body, court or

issued pursuant to this Agreement will be, when 
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully

(e) Shareholder Approval. This Agreement and the 
Merger shall have been approved by the affirmative vote of 
the holders of the percentage of MFC capital stock required 
for such approval under the provisions of MFC's Charter and 
Bylaws, the DGCL and the rules of the NYSE.

(f) Material Adverse Change. Since the date of 
this Agreement, there has been no material adverse change 
in, and no event, occurrence or development in the business 
of FBS or its subsidiaries that, taken together with other 
events, occurrences and developments with respect to such 
business, would have or would reasonably be expected to have 
a material adverse effect on, the business, operations or 
financial condition of FBS and its subsidiaries, taken as a 
whole.

(g) Fairness Opinion. Prior to mailing the 
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and immediately prior to the 
Effective Date, MFC shall have received a written opinion in 
a form reasonably acceptable to MFC from Dain Bosworth 
Incorporated (or another investment banking firm reasonably 
acceptable to MFC) to the effect that the consideration to 
be delivered in the Merger is fair from a financial point of 
view to the holders of MFC Common Stock.

6.3. Additional Conditions to Obligation of FBS. The 
obligation of FBS to consummate the transactions 
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement is also subject to the following conditions:

<PAGE>
(a) Representations and Compliance. The 
representations and warranties of MFC in this Agreement 
shall have been true and correct as of the date hereof, and 
such representations and warranties shall be true and 
correct as of the Effective Date as if made at and as of the 
Effective Date, except where the failure to be true and 
correct would not have, or would not reasonably be expected 
to have, a material adverse effect on the business, 
operations or financial condition of MFC and the

or operating results of MFC, the Bank or any of the 
Principal Nonbanking Subsidiaries.

(v) The execution and delivery of this Agreement

<PAGE>
(ix) MFC has the corporate power to consummate 
the transactions on its part contemplated by this 
Agreement. MFC has duly taken all requisite corporate 
action to authorize this Agreement and this Agreement 
has been duly executed and delivered by MFC and 
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of MFC 
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as to 
the enforcement of remedies to applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, moratorium and other laws affecting the 
rights of creditors generally and to judicial 
limitations on the enforcement of the remedy of 
specific performance.

filing with any public body, court or public authority, 
is necessary for the consummation by MFC of the 
transactions contemplated hereby which has not been 
obtained or made.

(e) Shareholder Approval. This Agreement and the

being accounted for as a pooling of interests, and FBS shall 
have received from Ernst & Young an opinion that the Merger 
shall qualify as a pooling of interests for accounting 
purposes.

(h) Adverse Proceedings. There shall not be 
threatened, instituted or pending any action or proceeding 
before any court or governmental authority or agency, 
domestic or foreign, (i) challenging or seeking to make

transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) seeking to

material portion of its business or assets or of MFC's or

the date of this Agreement, in this Agreement, any Schedule 
hereto, or any document specifically required to be 
furnished to FBS hereunder, regarding MFC or any of the 
Subsidiaries which would, individually or in the aggregate 
with other such facts and circumstances, (i) materially 
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement, or (ii) have a material adverse effect on 
the business, operations or financial condition of MFC and 
the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

material adverse effect on, the business, operations or 
financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a 
whole.

(l) Stock Option Agreement. Immediately following the 
execution and delivery of this Agreement, FBS and MFC shall 
have executed and delivered the Stock Option Agreement.

ARTICLE 7

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated 
prior to the Effective Date:

(a) by mutual consent of FBS and MFC;

(b) by either FBS or MFC, if any of the conditions to 
such party's obligation to consummate the transactions 
contemplated in this Agreement shall have become impossible 
to satisfy;

<PAGE>
(c) by either FBS or MFC, if this Agreement and the 
Merger are not duly approved by the shareholders of each of 
MFC and FBS, in each case at a meeting of shareholders (or 
any adjournment thereof) duly called and held for such 
purpose;

(d) by FBS or MFC if the Effective Date is not on or 
before September 30, 1995 (unless the failure to consummate 
the Merger by such date shall be due to the action or 
failure to act of the party seeking to terminate this 
Agreement in breach of such party's obligations under this 
Agreement);

(e) by FBS or MFC if the Average Price is less than 
$29.50; 

(f) by MFC if (1) any corporation, partnership, 
person, other entity or group, as defined in the 1934 Act 
(other than FBS or any affiliate of FBS) (a "Person"), 
shall have commenced (as such term is used in Rule 14d-2(b) 
under the 1934 Act) a bona fide tender offer for all 
outstanding shares of MFC Common Stock or any Person shall 
have made a bona fide written offer involving a merger or 
consolidation of MFC or the acquisition of all or 
substantially all of its assets, and (2) MFC's Board of 
Directors shall determine, based on advice of MFC's 
independent financial advisors that such offer is a material 
economic improvement to the Company's shareholders when 
compared to the Merger, and (3) MFC's Board of Directors 
determines upon the advice of its legal counsel that if they 
failed to recommend such offer or accept such proposal then 
such failure would be likely to result in a breach of the 
directors' fiduciary duties; provided, however, that MFC may 
not terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) 
until the expiration of five business days after written 
notice of any such offer or proposal referenced in this 
Section 7.1(f) has been delivered to FBS, together with a 
summary of the terms of any such offer or proposal;

(g) by FBS if, after the date hereof, any Person shall 
have commenced (as such term is used in Rule 14d-2(b) under 
the 1934 Act) a bona fide tender offer or exchange offer to 
acquire at least 20% of the then outstanding shares of MFC 
Common Stock, or if the Board of Directors of MFC shall have 
withdrawn, modified or changed its recommendation of this 
Agreement or the Merger; or

(h) by FBS if after the date hereof, there shall have 
occurred a "Subsequent Triggering Event" as defined in the 
Stock Option Agreement.

Any party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall 
give written notice of such termination and the reasons 
therefor to the other party.

7.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is 
terminated as permitted by Section 7.1, such termination 
shall be without liability or obligation of any party (or 
any shareholder, officer, employee, agent, consultant or 
representative of such party) to any other party to this 
Agreement, except (a) that if such termination is (i) by MFC 
pursuant to (A) Section 7.1(b) as a result of a failure of 

<PAGE>
the condition contained in Section 6.2(g), or (B) 
Section 7.1(f) or (ii) by FBS pursuant to (A) 
Section 7.1(g), (B) Section 7.1(h), or (C) Section 7.1(b) as 
a result of the failure of the condition contained in 
Section 6.3(a) because of the willful and material breach by 
MFC of any obligation, agreement or covenant referred to 
therein (a "willful and material" breach for the purposes 
of this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to have occurred if MFC 
has intentionally and knowingly taken, or intentionally and 
knowingly failed to take, any action which causes such 
breach), then MFC shall pay to FBS within three business 
days of such termination, a termination fee of $35,000,000 
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an 
account designated by FBS, (b) as may be otherwise provided 
in law or in equity, and (c) except as provided in 
Section 8.6.

7.3. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended 
except by an instrument in writing approved by the parties 
to this Agreement and signed on behalf of each of the 
parties hereto.

7.4. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Date, 
any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance 
of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party 
hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of 
any other party or with any conditions to its own 
obligations, in each case only to the extent such 
obligations, agreements and conditions are intended for its 
benefit.

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated July 21, 1994 
between FIRST BANK SYSTEM, INC., a Delaware corporation 
("Grantee"), and METROPOLITAN FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a 
Delaware corporation ("Issuer").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an 
Agreement of Merger and Consolidation of even date herewith 
(the "Merger Agreement"), which agreement has been executed 
by the parties hereto immediately prior to this Agreement; 
and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to 
Grantee's entering into the Merger Agreement and in 
consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee 
the Option (as hereinafter defined):

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing 
and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein 
and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as 
follows:

1. (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an 
unconditional, irrevocable option (the "Option") to 
purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 6,209,304 
fully paid and nonassessable shares of the common stock, 
$.01 par value, of Issuer ("Common Stock") at a price of 
$24.66 per share; provided, however, that in the event 
Issuer issues or agrees to issue any shares of Common Stock 
at a price less than $24.66 per share (as adjusted pursuant 
to subsection (b) of Section 5) other than in connection 
with the options, rights or plans disclosed on Schedule 3.3 
to the Merger Agreement, such price shall be equal to such 
lesser price (such price, as adjusted if applicable, the 
"Option Price"); provided further that in no event shall 
the number of shares for which this Option is exercisable 
exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common 
Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be 
received upon the exercise of the Option and the Option 
Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth.

(b) In the event that any additional shares 
of Common Stock are issued or otherwise become outstanding 
after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to 
this Agreement), the number of shares of Common Stock 
subject to the Option shall be increased so that, after 
such issuance, it equals 19.9% of the number of shares of 
Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving 
effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the 
Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or 
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize 
Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger 
Agreement.

2. (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) 
may exercise the Option, in whole or part, if, but only if, 
both an Initial Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) 
and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) 
shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise 
Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), provided that 
the Holder shall have sent the written notice of such 
exercise (as provided in subsection (e) of this Section 2) 
within 12 months following such Subsequent Triggering Event 
(or such later period as provided in Section 10). Each of 
the following shall be an Exercise Termination Event: (i) 
the Effective Date of the Merger; (ii) termination of the 
Merger Agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof 
if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of an 
Initial Triggering Event; (iii) termination of the Merger 
Agreement either (a) pursuant to Section 7.1(e) thereof, or 
(b) by Grantee solely as a result of failure of one or more 
of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b), 
6.1(c), 6.1(g), 6.3(e), 6.3(h), 6.3(i) or 6.3(k) or 
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) (as a result of failure of 
Grantee's shareholders to approve the Merger) or Section 
7.1(d) (as a result of failure to consummate the Merger on 
or before the date specified therein) if neither Issuer nor 
any of its affiliates, officers, directors, employees or 
agents shall have taken any actions that have contributed 
in any way, either directly or indirectly, to any such 
failure; or (iv) the passage of 12 months (or such longer 
period as provided in Section 10) after termination of the 
Merger Agreement (other than any termination of the Merger 
Agreement covered by the immediately preceding clause 
(iii)) if such termination follows the occurrence of an 
Initial Triggering Event (provided that if an Initial 
Triggering Event continues or occurs beyond such 
termination, the Exercise Termination Event shall be 12 
months (or such longer period as provided in Section 10) 
from the expiration of the Last Triggering Event but in no 
event more than 18 months (or such longer period as 
provided in Section 10) after such termination). The 
"Last Triggering Event" shall mean the last Initial 
Triggering Event to occur. The term "Holder" shall mean the 
holder or holders of the Option.

(b) The term "Initial Triggering Event" 
shall mean any of the following events or transactions 
occurring after the date hereof:

(i) Issuer or any of its 
Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) (each an 
"Issuer Subsidiary"), without having received 
Grantee's prior written consent, shall have 
entered into an agreement to engage in an 
Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) 
with any person (the term "person" for purposes 
of this Agreement having the meaning assigned 
thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), 
and the rules and regulations thereunder) other 
than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a 
"Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of Directors 
of Issuer shall have recommended that the 
shareholders of Issuer approve or accept any 
Acquisition Transaction other than as 
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this 
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, 
(a) "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (x) a 

<PAGE>
merger or consolidation, or any similar 
transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant 
Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation 
S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the "SEC")) of Issuer, (y) a 
purchase, lease or other acquisition of all or 
substantially all of the assets or deposits of 
Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, 
or (z) a purchase or other acquisition (including 
by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange 
or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or 
more of the voting power of Issuer or any 
Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, and (b) 
"Subsidiary" shall have the meaning set forth 
in Rule 12b-2 under the 1934 Act;

(ii) Any person other than Grantee or any 
Grantee Subsidiary shall have acquired beneficial 
ownership or the right to acquire beneficial 
ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding 
shares of Common Stock (the term "beneficial 
ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having 
the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of 
the 1934 Act, and the rules and regulations 
thereunder);

(iii) The shareholders of the Issuer shall 
not have approved the transactions contemplated 
by the Merger Agreement at the meeting held for 
that purpose or any adjournment thereof, or such 
meeting shall not have been held or shall have 
been cancelled prior to termination of the Merger 
Agreement, or Issuer's Board of Directors shall 
have withdrawn or modified (or publicly announced 
its intention to withdraw or modify or interest 
in withdrawing or modifying) its recommendation 
that the shareholders of Issuer approve the 
transactions contemplated by the Merger 
Agreement, or Issuer or any Issuer Subsidiary, 
without having received Grantee's prior written 
consent, shall have authorized, recommended, 
proposed (or publicly announced its intention to 
authorize, recommend or propose or interest in 
authorizing, recommending or proposing) an 
agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction 
with any person other than Grantee or a Grantee 
Subsidiary;

(iv) Any person other than Grantee or any 
Grantee Subsidiary shall have made a bona fide 
proposal to Issuer or its shareholders by public 
announcement or written communication that is or 
becomes the subject of public disclosure to 
engage in an Acquisition Transaction;

(v) Issuer shall have breached any 
covenant or obligation contained in the Merger 
Agreement and such breach would entitle Grantee 
to terminate the Merger Agreement;

<PAGE> 

(vi) Any person other than Grantee or any 
Grantee Subsidiary, other than in connection with 
a transaction to which Grantee has given its 
prior written consent, shall have filed an 
application or notice with the Federal Reserve 
Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") 
or other federal or state bank regulatory 
authority, which application or notice has been 
accepted for processing, for approval to engage 
in an Acquisition Transaction; or

(vii) Issuer shall have terminated the 
Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) by 
reason of the failure of Issuer's condition set 
forth in Section 6.2(g) or pursuant to Section 
7.1(f).

(c) The term "Subsequent Triggering Event" shall 
mean any of the following events or transactions occurring 
after the date hereof:

(i) The acquisition by any person of 
beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the then 
outstanding Common Stock; or

(ii) The occurrence of the Initial 
Triggering Event described in clause (i) of subsection (b) 
of this Section 2, except that the percentage referred to 
in clause (z) shall be 20%.

(d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in 
writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event 
or Subsequent Triggering Event (together, a "Triggering 
Event"), it being understood that the giving of such notice 
by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the 
Holder to exercise the Option.

(e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and 
wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a 
written notice (the date of which being herein referred to 
as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of 
shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) 
a place and date not earlier than three business days nor 
later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the 
closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"); provided 
that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal 
Reserve Board, the OTS or any other regulatory agency is 
required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall 
promptly file the required notice or application for 
approval, shall promptly notify the Issuer of such filing, 
and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of 
time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence 
shall run instead from the date on which any required 
notification periods have expired or been terminated or 
such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting 
period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the 
Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating 
thereto.

<PAGE>

(f) At the closing referred to in subsection (e)
of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the 
aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock 
purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in 
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank 
account designated by Issuer, provided that failure or 
refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall 
not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.

(g) At such closing, simultaneously with the 
delivery of immediately available funds as provided in 
subsection (f) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to 
the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the 
number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder 
and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new 
Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to 
purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder.

(h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a 
closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend 
that shall read substantially as follows:

"The transfer of the shares represented by this 
certificate is subject to certain provisions of an 
agreement between the registered holder hereof and 
Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such 
agreement is on file at the principal office of Issuer 
and will be provided to the holder hereof without 
charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written request 
therefor."

It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the 
resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933 (the 
"1933 Act") in the above legend shall be removed by 
delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such 
reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a 
copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion 
of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to Issuer, 
to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes 
of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions of 
this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by 
delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such 
reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in 
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under 
circumstances that do not require the retention of such 
reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its 
entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and 
(ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall 
bear any other legend as may be required by law.

(i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of 
the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for 
under subsection (e) of this Section 2 and the tender of 
the applicable purchase price in immediately available 
funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of 
record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such 
exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of 
Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates 
representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be 
actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all 

<PAGE>
expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and 
local taxes and other charges that may be payable in 
connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of 
stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the 
Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.

3. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all 
times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient 
authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Common Stock 
so that the Option may be exercised without additional 
authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all 
other options, warrants, convertible securities and other 
rights to purchase Common Stock; (ii) that it will not, by 
charter amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, 
merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other 
voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or 
performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or 
conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; 
(iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time 
be required (including (x) complying with all premerger 
notification, reporting and waiting period requirements 
specified in 15 U.S.C. 18a and regulations promulgated 
thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the Home Owners Loan 
Act, as amended, or any state or other federal banking law, 
prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board, 
the OTS or to any state or other federal regulatory 
authority is necessary before the Option may be exercised, 
cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such 
applications or notices and providing such information to 
the Federal Reserve Board, the OTS or such state or other 
federal regulatory authority as they may require) in order 
to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly 
and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant 
hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action provided 
herein to protect the rights of the Holder against 
dilution.

4. This Agreement (and the Option granted 
hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of 
the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this 
Agreement at the principal office of the Issuer, for other 
Agreements providing for Options of different denominations 
entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms 
and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, 
in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock 
purchasable hereunder. The terms "Agreement" and "Option" 
as used herein include any Agreements and related Options 
for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) 
may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence 
reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, 
destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the 
case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably 
satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and 
cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will 
execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. 
Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall 
constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part 
of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, 
destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by 
anyone.

<PAGE>

5. In addition to the adjustment in the number 
of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon 
exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this 
Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable 
upon the exercise of the Option shall be subject to 
adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 5.

(a) In the event of any change in Common 
Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, 
mergers, recapitalizations, combinations, 
subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares or the 
like, the type and number of shares of Common Stock 
purchasable upon exercise hereof shall be 
appropriately adjusted and proper provision shall be 
made so that, in the event that any additional shares 
of Common Stock are to be issued or otherwise become 
outstanding as a result of any such change (other than 
pursuant to an exercise of the Option), the number of 
shares of Common Stock that remain subject to the 
Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance 
and together with shares of Common Stock previously 
issued pursuant to the exercise of the Option (as 
adjusted on account of any of the foregoing changes in 
the Common Stock), it equals 19.9% of the number of 
shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding.

(b) Whenever the number of shares of Common 
Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof is adjusted as 
provided in this Section 5, the Option Price shall be 
adjusted by multiplying the Option Price by a 
fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the 
number of shares of Common Stock purchasable prior to 
the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be 
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock 
purchasable after the adjustment.

6. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent 
Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise 
Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee 
delivered within 12 months (or such later period as 
provided in Section 10) of such Subsequent Triggering Event 
(whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent 
holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the 
shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly 
prepare, file and keep current a registration statement 
under the 1933 Act covering any shares issued and issuable 
pursuant to this Option and shall use its best efforts to 
cause such registration statement to become effective and 
remain current in order to permit the sale or other 
disposition of any shares of Common Stock issued upon total 
or partial exercise of this Option ("Option Shares") in 
accordance with any plan of disposition requested by 
Grantee. Issuer will use its best efforts to cause such 
registration statement first to become effective and then 
to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 
days from the day such registration statement first becomes 
effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably 
necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. 
Grantee shall have the right to demand two such 
registrations. The Issuer shall bear the costs of such 
registrations (including, but not limited to, attorneys' 
fees, printing costs and filing fees). The foregoing 
notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee 

<PAGE>
for registration of Option Shares as provided above, Issuer 
is in registration with respect to an underwritten public 
offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good 
faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing 
underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or 
underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Option 
Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the 
shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of 
Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration 
statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; provided, 
however, that after any such required reduction the number 
of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the 
account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the 
total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer 
in the aggregate; and provided further, however, that if 
such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a 
registration statement for the balance as promptly as 
practicable thereafter as to which no reduction pursuant to 
this Section 6 shall be permitted or occur and the Holder 
shall thereafter be entitled to one additional 
registration. Each such Holder shall provide all 
information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in 
any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If 
requested by any such Holder in connection with such 
registration, Issuer shall become a party to any 
underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, 
but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of 
representations, warranties, indemnities and other 
agreements customarily included in such underwriting 
agreements for Issuer. Upon receiving any request under 
this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a 
copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be 
entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in 
each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to 
the address of record of the persons entitled to receive 
such copies.

7. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent 
Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise 
Termination Event, (i) at the request of the Holder, 
delivered within 12 months of such occurrence (or such 
later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall 
repurchase the Option from the Holder at a price (the 
"Option Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the amount by which 
(A) the market/offer price (as defined below) exceeds (B) 
the Option Price, multiplied by the number of shares for 
which this Option may then be exercised plus (y) Grantee's 
Out-of-Pocket Expenses (as defined below) (to the extent 
not previously reimbursed), and (ii) at the request of the 
owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "Owner"), 
delivered within 12 months of such occurrence (or such 
later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall 
repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner 
as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "Option Share 
Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the market/offer price 
multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated 
plus (y) Grantee's Out-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent 
not previously reimbursed). The term "Out-of-Pocket 
Expenses" shall mean Grantee's reasonable out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including without 
limitation legal, accounting and consulting fees. The term 
"market/offer price" shall mean the highest of (i) the 
price per share of Common Stock at which a tender or 
exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per 
share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party 
pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest 

<PAGE>
closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-
month period immediately preceding the date the Holder 
gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or 
the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option 
Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale 
of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets or deposits, 
the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets or 
deposits and the current market value of the remaining 
assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized 
investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the 
Owner, as the case may be, divided by the number of shares 
of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such 
sale. In determining the market/offer price, the value of 
consideration other than cash shall be determined by a 
nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by 
the Holder or Owner, as the case may be.

(b) its right to require Issuer to 
repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to 
this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, 
at its principal office, a copy of this Agreement or 
certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied 
by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or 
the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to 
repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in 
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7. As 
promptly as practicable, and in any event within five 
business days after the surrender of the Option and/or 
certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of 
such notice or notices relating thereto, Issuer shall 
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option 
Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share 
Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof that 
Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and 
regulation from so delivering.

(c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited 
under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of 
administrative policy, from repurchasing the Option and/or 
the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so 
notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver 
or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder 
and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option 
Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, 
respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from 
delivering, within five business days after the date on 
which Issuer is no longer so prohibited; provided, however, 
that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of 
repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is 
prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a 
consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to 
the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option 
Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, 
respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use 
its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and 
legal approvals and to file any required notices as 
promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such 
repurchase), the Holder or Owner may revoke its notice of 
repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares whether in 
whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in 
the latter case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the 
Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, that portion of 
the Option Purchase Price or the Option Share Repurchase 
Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and 
(ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a 

<PAGE>
new Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to 
purchase that number of shares of Common Stock obtained by 
multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for which 
the surrendered Agreement was exercisable at the time of 
delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the 
numerator of which is the Option Repurchase Price less the 
portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder and the 
denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) 
to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is 
then so prohibited from repurchasing. If an Exercise 
Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the date of 
the notice by Issuer described in the first sentence of 
this subsection (c), or shall be scheduled to occur at any 
time before the expiration of a period ending on the 
thirtieth day after such date, the Holder shall nonetheless 
have the right to exercise the Option until the expiration 
of such 30-day period.

8. (a) In the event that prior to an 
Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an 
agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, 
other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, and shall not 
be the continuing or surviving corporation of such 
consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other 
than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, to merge into Issuer 
and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving 
corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then 
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or 
exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person 
or cash or any other property or the then outstanding 
shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent 
less than 50% of the outstanding shares and share 
equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or 
otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its or any 
Significant Subsidiary's assets or deposits to any person, 
other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, then, and in 
each such case, the agreement governing such transaction 
shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon 
the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms 
and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or 
exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at 
the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring 
Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that 
controls the Acquiring Corporation.

(b) The following terms have the meanings 
indicated:

(i) "Acquiring Corporation" shall 
mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation 
of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if 
other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in 
which Issuer is the continuing or surviving 
person, and (iii) the transferee of all or 
substantially all of Issuer's assets or deposits 
(or the assets or deposits of a Significant 
Subsidiary of Issuer).

(ii) "Substitute Common Stock" shall 
mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the 
Substitute Option upon exercise of the Substitute 
Option.

<PAGE>
(iii) "Assigned Value" shall mean 
the market/offer price, as defined in Section 7.

(iv) "Average Price" shall mean the 
average closing price of a share of the 
Substitute Common Stock for one year immediately 
preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in 
question, but in no event higher than the closing 
price of the shares of Substitute Common Stock on 
the day preceding such consolidation, merger or 
sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of 
the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be 
computed with respect to a share of common stock 
issued by the person merging into Issuer or by 
any company which controls or is controlled by 
such person, as the Holder may elect.

(c) The Substitute Option shall have the 
same terms as the Option, provided, that if the terms of 
the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the 
same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as 
possible and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. 
The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into 
an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the 
Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this 
Agreement (after giving effect for such purpose to the 
provisions of Section 9), which agreement shall be 
applicable to the Substitute Option.

(d) The Substitute Option shall be 
exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common 
Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the 
number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is 
then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The 
exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of 
Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option 
Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which 
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the 
Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which 
shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock 
for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.

(e) In no event, pursuant to any of the 
foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be 
exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute 
Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the 
Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option 
would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of 
Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but 
for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option 
(the "Substitute Option Issuer") shall make a cash 
payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of 
the Substitute Option without giving effect to the 
limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the 
Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in 
this clause (e). This difference in value shall be 
determined by a nationally recognized investment banking 
firm selected by the Holder.

(f) Issuer shall not enter into any 
transaction described in subsection (a) of this Section 8 
unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that 

<PAGE>
controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all 
the obligations of Issuer hereunder.

9. (a) At the request of the holder of the 
Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Holder"), the 
issuer of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option 
Issuer") shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the 
Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "Substitute 
Option Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the amount by which 
(i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) 
exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, 
multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common 
Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be exercised 
plus (y) Grantee's Out-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent 
not previously reimbursed), and at the request of the owner 
(the "Substitute Share Owner") of shares of Substitute 
Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"), the Substitute 
Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a 
price (the "Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to 
(x) the Highest Closing Price multiplied by the number of 
Substitute Shares so designated plus (y) Grantee's Out-of-
Pocket Expenses (to the extent not previously reimbursed). 
The term "Highest Closing Price" shall mean the highest 
closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within 
the six-month period immediately preceding the date the 
Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required 
repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share 
Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the 
Substitute Shares, as applicable.

(b) The Substitute Option Holder and the 
Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, may exercise 
its respective right to require the Substitute Option 
Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the 
Substitute Shares pursuant to this Section 9 by 
surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option 
Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such 
Substitute Option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, 
a copy of this Agreement) and certificates for Substitute 
Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating 
that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share 
Owner, as the case may be, elects to require the Substitute 
Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and/or 
the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provisions of 
this Section 9. As promptly as practicable and in any event 
within five business days after the surrender of the 
Substitute Option and/or certificates representing 
Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices 
relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall 
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option 
Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or to the 
Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase 
Price therefor or the portion thereof which the Substitute 
Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law 
and regulation from so delivering.

(c) To the extent that the Substitute 
Option Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or 
regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, 
from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the 
Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option 
Issuer shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option 
Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter 
deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the 
Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, 

<PAGE>
as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share 
Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer 
prohibited from delivering, within five business days after 
the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer 
so prohibited; provided, however, that if the Substitute 
Option Issuer is at any time after delivery of a notice of 
repurchase pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 9 
prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a 
consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to 
the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share 
Owner, as appropriate, the Substitute Option Repurchase 
Price and the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, 
respectively, in full (and the Substitute Option Issuer 
shall use its best efforts to receive all required 
regulatory and legal approvals as promptly as practicable 
in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute 
Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner may revoke its 
notice of repurchase of the Substitute Option or the 
Substitute Shares either in whole or to the extent of 
prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, the Substitute 
Option Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Substitute 
Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, 
that portion of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price or 
the Substitute Share Repurchase Price that the Substitute 
Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii) 
deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Substitute 
Option Holder, a new Substitute Option evidencing the right 
of the Substitute Option Holder to purchase that number of 
shares of the Substitute Common Stock obtained by 
multiplying the number of shares of the Substitute Common 
Stock for which the surrendered Substitute Option was 
exercisable at the time of delivery of the notice of 
repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
Substitute Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof 
theretofore delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and 
the denominator of which is the Substitute Option 
Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Substitute Share Owner, a 
certificate for the Substitute Option Shares it is then so 
prohibited from repurchasing. If an Exercise Termination 
Event shall have occurred prior to the date of the notice 
by the Substitute Option Issuer described in the first 
sentence of this subsection (c), or shall be scheduled to 
occur at any time before the expiration of a period ending 
on the thirtieth day after such date, the Substitute Option 
Holder shall nevertheless have the right to exercise the 
Substitute Option until the expiration of such 30-day 
period.

10. The 30-day, 12-month or 18-month periods for 
exercise of certain rights under Sections 2, 6, 7, 9 and 12 
shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain 
all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights 
(for so long as the Holder is using commercially reasonable 
efforts to obtain such regulatory approvals), and for the 
expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to 
the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b) 
of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise.

11. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to 
Grantee as follows:

(a) Issuer has full corporate power and 
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to 
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The 
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the 

<PAGE>
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have 
been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors 
of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of 
Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to 
consummate the transactions so contemplated. This 
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered 
by Issuer. This Agreement is the valid and legally binding 
obligation of Issuer.

(b) Issuer has taken all necessary 
corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it 
to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the 
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms 
will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the 
Option, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the 
maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time and 
from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, 
upon issuance pursuant thereto, will be duly authorized, 
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be 
delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrance 
and security interests and not subject to any preemptive 
rights.

12. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any 
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or the 
Option created hereunder to any other person, without the 
express written consent of the other party, except that in 
the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred 
prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Grantee, subject to 
the express provisions hereof, may assign in whole or in 
part its rights and obligations hereunder within 12 months 
following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later 
period as provided in Section 10); provided, however, that 
until the date 30 days following the date on which the 
Federal Reserve Board and OTS have approved applications by 
Grantee to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject to 
the Option, Grantee may not assign its rights under the 
Option except in (i) a widely dispersed public 
distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one 
party acquires the right to purchase in excess of 2% of the 
voting shares of Issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single 
party (e.g., a broker or investment banker) for the purpose 
of conducting a widely dispersed public distribution on 
Grantee's behalf, or (iv) any other manner approved by the 
Federal Reserve Board and OTS.

13. If the Grantee has been paid the termination 
fee provided for in the Merger Agreement (the "Termination 
Fee") and at any time receives any Net Realized Cash (as 
defined below) under this Agreement, then Grantee shall be 
obligated, as provided in this Section 13, to reimburse 
such Termination Fee, but only up to the amount of Net 
Realized Cash received by the Grantee. The term "Net 
Realized Cash" shall mean: (i) any cash proceeds received 
on sale or other disposition of Option Shares (or on sale 
or other disposition of other consideration received in 
exchange for such Option Shares), net of all related 
commissions, fees, underwriting discounts, costs and 
expenses; (ii) any Option Repurchase Price paid pursuant to 
Section 7 hereof; and (iii) any cash proceeds received in 
exchange for sale or other disposition of the Option (or 
upon sale or other disposition of other consideration 
received in exchange for such Option), net of all related 
commissions, fees, underwriting discounts, costs and 
expenses. If the Grantee becomes obligated to reimburse 

<PAGE>
all or any part of the Termination Fee under this Section 
13, Grantee shall do so as soon as practicable upon receipt 
of the Net Realized Cash, by wire transfer of immediately 
available funds to a bank account designated by Issuer. In 
no event shall the aggregate amount payable by Grantee 
under this Section 13 exceed the lesser of (x) the amount 
of Termination Fee previously received by Grantee and (y) 
the amount of Net Realized Cash received by Grantee under 
this Agreement.

14. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best 
efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents 
of, all third parties and governmental authorities 
necessary to the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, including without 
limitation applying to the Federal Reserve Board under the 
Bank Holding Company Act and the OTS under the Home Owners 
Loan Act for approval to acquire the shares issuable 
hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to 
state banking authorities for approval to acquire the 
shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder until such time, 
if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so.

15. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages 
would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this 
Agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations 
of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party 
hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief.

16. If any term, provision, covenant or 
restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court 
or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent 
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the 
remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and 
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in 
full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, 
impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or 
regulatory agency determines that the Holder is not 
permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to 
repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares 
of Common Stock provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as 
adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is the 
express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire 
or to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of 
shares as may be permissible, without any amendment or 
modification hereof.

17. All notices, requests, claims, demands and 
other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been 
duly given when delivered in person, by fax, telecopy, or 
by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return 
receipt requested ) at the respective addresses of the 
parties set forth in the Merger Agreement.

18. This Agreement shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of 
Minnesota, regardless of the laws that might otherwise 
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws 
thereof.

<PAGE>
19. This Agreement may be executed in two or 
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an 
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the 
same agreement.

20. Except as otherwise expressly provided 
herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all 
costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in 
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, 
including fees and expenses of its own financial 
consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel.

herein or in the Merger Agreement, this Agreement contain 
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to 
the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all 
prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, 
written or oral. The terms and conditions of this 
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon 
the parties hereto and their respective successors and 
permitted assignees. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed 
or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other 
than the parties hereto, and their respective successors 
except as assignees, any rights, remedies, obligations or 
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as 
expressly provided herein.

22. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and 
not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto

FIRST BANK SYSTEM AND METROPOLITAN FINANCIAL
SIGN PURCHASE AGREEMENT

MINNEAPOLIS, July 21, 1994--First Bank System, Inc. (NYSE: FBS) today
announced that it had signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire
Minneapolis-based Metropolitan Financial Corporation (NYSE: MFC). The
companies previously announced on July 1 that they had signed a letter
of intent. The acquisition is subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter
of 1995.

FBS will exchange .6803 shares of First Bank System common stock
for each common share of Metropolitan resulting in a per share price
of $24.66 based upon FBS closing stock price of $36.25 on July 20,
1994. The exchange ratio is subject to change based upon changes in
FBS stock price under certain circumstances. The aggregate purchase
price is approximately $800 million. In its July 1 announcement, FBS
said that upon completion of the due diligence process, it would
establish a definitive exchange ratio that would be between .6803 and
.7347 shares of FBS common stock for each common share of Metropolitan.

The exchange ratio would be adjusted if the average of the closing
prices of FBS common stock is less than $33.00 for the 20 trading days
ending three business days prior to the last date of both companies'
meetings of shareholders. In that event, the exchange ratio would be
multiplied by the quotient of $33.00 divided by the average price. In
addition, if the average

price is greater than $40.50, the exchange ratio would be adjusted by
multiplying the ratio by the quotient of $40.50 divided by the average
price. Either company can terminate the agreement if the average price
of FBS common stock is less than $29.50. In addition, Metropolitan will
issue to FBS a warrant granting FBS the option to purchase up to 19.9%
of the outstanding shares of Metropolitan common stock under certain
circumstances.

John F. Grundhofer, chairman, president and chief executive officer
of First Bank System said, "FBS has become a high performing company over
the past five years by taking actions that make strategic and financial
sense. This acquisition delivers positive returns to shareholders as
well as a broader line of products and services to Metropolitan
customers." The acquisition adds the states of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas,
and Wyoming to First Bank System's service area and expands its existing
presence in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The
company expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings by 
approximately 10 cents per share in the first year of operation.

Norman M. Jones, chairman and chief executive officer of Metropolitan
Financial Corporation, will become a member of the FBS Board of Directors
and will serve as chairman of Metropolitan Federal Bank fsb, which will
be renamed First Bank fsb. First Bank fsb will operate under a thrift
charter in selected locations. "This acquisition is in keeping with our
tradition of providing strong shareholder returns," said Jones. "It will
result in more than a 30 percent annualized total rate of return to
shareholders who purchased shares when Metropolitan became a public
company in 1983. Additionally our customers will now have access to a
wider variety of products and services. I am also pleased to join the
First Bank board of directors to be the chairman of their thrift
subsidiary and to continue my involvement in the financial services
industry."

Metropolitan Financial said that it expects to take an estimated
one time, after tax restructuring charge of $45 million prior to the close
as a result of the acquisition
