THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC. REPORTS RECORD NET INCOME AND E.P.S.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
96 Cents Third Quarter E.P.S. a 30% Increase Over Last Year;

Interest Spreads and 18.68% ROE Also Records

NEW YORK, N.Y., October 13, 1994 -- The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
(NYSE: BK) reported third quarter fully diluted earnings per share of 96
cents, a 30% increase over the 74 cents earned in the third quarter of
1993. Net income rose by 28% to $194 million from $151 million earned in
the same period last year. 
Fully diluted earnings per share in the first nine months of 1994
were $2.70, a 38% increase over the $1.96 earned last year. Net income
for the first nine months was $548 million, up 36% over the $402 million
earned in the same period last year.

<PAGE> 2.

Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, totaled $459
million in the third quarter, an all-time high, and a $70 million or 18%
increase over the third quarter of last year. Tax equivalent net interest
income also was up significantly from the second quarter, as it increased
by $38 million, or 9%. The net interest rate spread of 3.35%, also a
quarterly record, was 9 basis points higher than in the second quarter and
26 basis points higher than the third quarter of 1993. The Company also
noted a continued shift in asset mix toward higher yielding assets,
including strong growth in credit card outstandings. Revenues from the
Company's securities and other processing business remained strong. A
lower provision for loan losses, lower other real estate expenses, and
continued control of operating costs contributed to higher earnings. 
On October 11, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly
common stock cash dividend of 32 cents per share, a 16% increase over the
27.5 cents paid in the previous quarter. The increase results in an
annual rate of $1.28 per share, the highest in the Company's history. 
This is the second increase in the common stock dividend in the last six
months. (On April 12, the dividend was raised 22% or 5 cents per share.) 
Combined, these two actions have resulted in an increase in the quarterly
dividend of 42% or 9.5 cents per share. The dividend is payable on
November 3, 1994 to holders of record as of the close of business on
October 21, 1994.
The Company's estimated Tier I capital and Total capital ratios were 
8.38% and 12.79% at September 30, 1994 compared with 8.29% and 12.76% at
June 30, 1994, and 8.51% and 13.33% one year ago. Tangible common equity

<PAGE> 3.

as a percent of total assets was 6.99% at September 30, 1994 compared with
6.49% at June 30, 1994 and 6.72% at September 30, 1993. 
Return on average assets in the third quarter of 1994 was 1.49%,
slightly lower than the record 1.50% in the first quarter of 1994. Return
on average assets was 1.42% in the second quarter of 1994 and 1.28% in the
third quarter of 1993. Return on average common equity was a record
18.68% in the third quarter of 1994. Return on average common equity was
17.67% in the second quarter of 1994 and 15.95% in the third quarter of
1993.

On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income amounted to a
record $459 million in the third quarter of 1994, compared with $389
million in the same period of 1993, an increase of 18%. The net interest
rate spread was a record 3.35% in the third quarter of 1994 compared with
3.26% in the second quarter of 1994 and 3.09% one year ago. The net yield
on interest earning assets, also a record, was 4.16% in the third quarter
of 1994 compared with 3.98% in the second quarter of 1994 and 3.81% in the
same period last year. The spread and yield benefitted modestly from the
return of a portion of the Company's credit card securitization to its

<PAGE> 4.

balance sheet. 
For the first nine months of 1994, net interest income, on a taxable
equivalent basis, amounted to $1,277 million compared with $1,157 million
in the same period of 1993, an increase of 10%. The year-to-date net
interest rate spread was 3.26% in 1994 compared with 3.13% in 1993, while
the net yield on interest-earning assets was 4.01% in 1994 and 3.85% in
1993. 
The Company's credit card business continued its strong growth. 
Managed outstandings were up by 24% to $7.2 billion and the number of card
accounts increased by 27% to 5.7 million from one year ago. The credit
quality of the card portfolio continues to be excellent. Net charge-offs
as a percentage of managed average outstandings were 2.45% in the third
quarter of 1994, down from 2.86% in the second quarter and 2.97% one year
ago.

NONINTEREST INCOME
- ------------------

Noninterest income was $321 million and $991 million in the third
quarter and first nine months of 1994, compared with $335 million and
$1,011 million in the same periods last year. Securities transactions and
foreign exchange and other trading activities were lower in the third
quarter and nine month periods of 1994 compared with 1993. 
Securities processing fees increased 15% to $90 million for the third
quarter of 1994 from $78 million in the third quarter of 1993. American
depositary receipts showed exceptional growth. Other areas of strength
included mutual fund custody, government securities clearance and
corporate trust. Other processing fees, principally funds transfer,

<PAGE> 5.

deposit services, and trade finance, were $43 million for the third
quarter of 1994, compared with $42 million in the same period last year,
an increase of 2%. Trade finance revenue was particularly strong,
increasing by 16% over last year's third quarter. Fees in the funds
transfer and deposit services areas were lower this quarter. This was due
to customers' increasing use of compensating balances in lieu of fees in
the current rising interest rate environment.
For the first nine months of 1994, securities processing fees
increased 16% to $268 million and other processing fees increased 8% to
$129 million, up from $231 million and $119 million in the same period of
1993.
Service charges and fees were $122 million in the third quarter of
1994, compared with $115 million in the third quarter of last year, an
increase of 6%. Factoring commissions reached a record level. Other
areas of strength included syndications and credit card interchange
income. In the third quarter, noninterest income attributable to the
Company's credit card securitization was $11 million less than the
comparable period of last year due to a portion of these assets returning
to the balance sheet. For the first nine months of 1994, service charges
and fees were $356 million compared with $344 million in 1993.
There was a $1 million securities loss recorded in the third quarter
of 1994, compared with a $12 million gain in the third quarter of 1993. 
Year-to-date securities gains totaled $15 million and $60 million in 1994
and 1993. Third quarter and year-to-date foreign exchange profits and
trading activities totaled $10 million and $39 million in 1994, compared
with $22 million and $64 million in 1993. 

<PAGE> 6.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES
- ------------------------------------

Total noninterest expense was $420 million in the third quarter
compared with $405 million in 1993. The increase is partially
attributable to acquisitions related to the Company's factoring and
corporate trust businesses, as well as higher accruals for incentive
compensation. Year-to-date total noninterest expense was $1,232 million
in 1994 down slightly from $1,238 million in 1993. 
OREO expense was down by $7 million, or 70% from last year's third
quarter. Decreases also were recorded in occupancy and furniture and
equipment expenses, which were down by a combined $2.4 million, or 3.5%. 
Excluding the effect of the acquisitions, salaries increased 4% in the
third quarter from the same period of last year. 
The effective tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months
of 1994 were 37.4% in both periods compared with 39.8% and 38.7% for the
same periods last year.
