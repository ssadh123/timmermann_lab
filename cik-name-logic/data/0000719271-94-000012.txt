Item 5. OTHER EVENTS

On July 12, 1994, Anuhco, Inc. ("Anuhco") reported the Missouri
Court of Appeals, Western District, issued a unanimous opinion
dated July 12, 1994, affirming a February 23, 1993 judgment for $70
million in damages in favor of Anuhco and its subsidiary American
Freight System, Inc. ("AFS") and against Westinghouse Electric
Corporation ("WEC"). This judgment, which bears interest at 9% and
is fully bonded, was entered in a case filed by Anuhco and AFS
against WEC seeking damages as a result of WEC's failure to provide
financing pursuant to a loan commitment issued by WEC on June 3,
1988. A motion for rehearing before the Missouri Court of Appeals,
Western District, and in the alternative, a motion for transfer to
the Missouri Supreme Court were filed on July 27, 1994.

Proceeds of the judgment, assuming no modification in such
rehearing or transfer, net of trial expenses, will be remitted to
AFS. AFS will distribute such proceeds under a Reorganization Plan
adopted in 1991. Payments received by Anuhco as a result of
distributions under the Reorganization Plan are recorded by it as
income from discontinued operations. Based on our current
estimates, if the $70 million judgment plus accrued interest is
substantially or fully collected, and both the remaining AFS assets
are converted to cash and the remaining claims against AFS are
resolved in accordance with expectations, Anuhco would ultimately
receive net proceeds of $38 million to $45 million. This
represents $5 to $6 per share on Anuhco's outstanding shares. 
Anuhco and AFS are unable to predict when or how this matter will
ultimately be resolved.

Item 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

Not Applicable.
