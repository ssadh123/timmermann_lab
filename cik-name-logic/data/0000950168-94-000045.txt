all of the stockholders of Pilliod Holding Company ("Pilliod")
(the stockholders collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Stockholders") to purchase all of the outstanding stock of
Pilliod in a transaction valued at approximately $54,000,000.
LADD agreed to retire debt of Pilliod's wholly-owned subsidiary,
The Pilliod Cabinet Company ("Pilliod Cabinet"), of approximately
$30,000,000 and to pay approximately $24,000,000 in cash to the
Stockholders. The Agreement provided that the transaction was
subject to the termination or expiration of the waiting period
required pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. On January 7,
1994, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of
the waiting period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

On January 28, 1994, LADD entered into a Transfer and
Administration Agreement ("TAA") with Enterprise Funding
Corporation ("EFC") to sell an undivided interest in certain of
LADD's trade accounts receivable. The TAA provides for EFC to
pay to LADD up to $30,000,000 for receivables purchased. 
Effective January 31, 1994, LADD sold an interest in a defined
pool of trade accounts receivable which generated $20,000,000 in
cash.

On January 28, 1994, LADD entered into an unsecured one
year revolving line of credit with The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.
(the "Chase Line of Credit") in the aggregate principal amount of
$20,000,000.

On January 31, 1994, the Pilliod purchase transaction
was consummated and LADD retired $29,893,000 of debt of Pilliod
Cabinet, assumed $247,000 of debt of Pilliod Cabinet and paid
$23,860,000 in cash to the Stockholders. The purchase price was
financed by the $20,000,000 generated by the sale of trade
accounts receivable pursuant to the TAA and funds from available
short-term and long-term bank lines of credit, including the
Chase Line of Credit.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pilliod Holding Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pilliod
Holding Company as of May 2, 1992 and May 1, 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity (capital deficiency) and cash
flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pilliod Holding
Company at May 2, 1992 and May 1, 1993 and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pilliod
Holding Company (Company) and the combined accounts of its wholly-owned
subsidiary, The Pilliod Cabinet Company (Cabinet Company). The Company's fiscal
year ends on the Saturday nearest April 30.
INVENTORIES
The Cabinet Company's inventories are valued at the lower of last-in,
first-out (LIFO) cost or market.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment are provided
over the estimated useful lives of the assets using both straight-line and
declining balance methods.
Goodwill, which was generated by the March 19, 1985 acquisition of Cabinet
Company, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
PROFIT SHARING PLAN
Substantially all of the Company's employees are participants in a profit
sharing plan. Contributions to the plan are at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. No contributions were made in fiscal 1992 or 1993.
NEW STANDARD FOR ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES
The Company has not adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, (SFAS No. 109), which
is required to be adopted in the Company's 1994 fiscal year. Under the liability
method required by the Statement, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The
Company's current accounting policies require that future tax effects related

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- Continued
to assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination be included in the
recorded amounts of the related assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 requires
that such acquired assets be recorded at their full value and that the resulting
differences between book and tax bases be accounted for consistent with the
liability method. It further requires that assets and liabilities acquired in
previous business combinations be restated. Under the Company's current method,
income tax expense is determined using the deferred method. Deferred tax expense
is based on items of income and expense that are reported in different years in
the financial statements and tax returns and are measured at the tax rate in
effect in the year the difference originated.
The Company has not decided whether or not it will restate prior year
financial statements as permitted by SFAS No. 109; therefore the impact of
adoption cannot be quantified. The Company believes, however, that the adoption
of SFAS No. 109 will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or
results of operations.
2. INVENTORIES
Under the LIFO method, inventories have been reduced by approximately $718
and $118 at May 2, 1992 and May 1, 1993, respectively, from amounts which would
have been reported under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
3. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Cabinet Company is principally engaged in the business of furniture
manufacturing. Substantially all accounts receivable are from department stores
and furniture retailers. Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation
of credit reports, payment practices and, in most cases, financial condition.
Collateral or letters of credit are generally not required. Credit losses are
provided for in the financial statements and consistently have been within
management's expectations.

The agreement for the revolving line of credit and term loans limits total
borrowings outstanding for the term of the agreement to $27,900. Borrowings
under the revolving line of credit are based on 85% of eligible trade accounts
receivable and 50% of eligible FIFO inventory, not to exceed $18,000 ($14,703
was available under the formula at May 1, 1993 of which $9,388 was outstanding).
The agreement runs through May 1995 and is automatically renewed for successive
one-year periods unless the agreement is terminated by the Company or the banks.
The entire amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit has been
excluded from current liabilities in the May 1, 1993 balance sheet because the
Company intends that at least that amount would remain outstanding under the
agreement for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year from the balance
sheet date.
Borrowings under the agreement are secured by substantially all of the
assets of Cabinet Company. The agreement contains certain financial covenants,
the most restrictive of which 1) require maintenance of certain liquidity
ratios, yearly income levels and net worth levels, 2) limit future borrowings
and 3) limit declaration of dividends. Notes payable to banks are secured under
the agreement and are generally subject to the same conditions and covenants. At
May 1, 1993, the Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements of the
agreement as amended on April 28, 1993. At May 2, 1992, the Company violated
certain of the covenant requirements. The banks did not grant

waivers of the covenant violations and could have declared the Company in
default and the debt due; therefore, all borrowings under the agreement were
classified as current in the May 2, 1992 balance sheet.
On April 28, 1993, the Company amended the revolving line of credit and
term loan agreement. The amendment revised financial covenants, extended the
termination date of the agreement and permitted additional term borrowings of
$2,000 (all of which were outstanding at May 1, 1993). The borrowings were used
to pay a portion of the interest due on the subordinated notes. In connection
with the amendment, the Company incurred a commitment fee of $240.
On April 28, 1993 the Company entered into an agreement with the holders of
its subordinated notes to amend the notes. The agreement required the payment of
all accrued and unpaid interest through February 18, 1993 and the forgiveness of
$2,175 of principal. The principal balance of $2,825 of the amended subordinated
notes is payable $565 annually beginning April 1994 through April 1998, with
interest at 12.186% per annum payable semi-annually beginning October 28, 1993.
The Company is required to redeem the subordinated notes at par upon a Change of
Control Event (as defined in the amended notes) and, if certain types of Change
of Control Event occur on or prior to April 28, 1994, the Company will be
required to pay an additional $1,000 upon such redemption; as such, recognition
of gains has been deferred until the expiration of the contingency.
The May 1, 1993 carrying value of the subordinated debt consists of
remaining principal balance, expected interest over the life of the notes and
net contingent amounts payable. In the event a Change of Control Event does not
occur prior to April 28, 1994, the carrying value of the subordinated notes
would be reduced to future principal and interest requirements.
The required minimum annual maturities of long-term debt, including the
principal portion of capital lease obligations, for the fiscal years subsequent
to May 1, 1993 are as follows: 1994 - $4,661; 1995 - $3,708; 1996 - $15,211;
1997 - $703; 1998 - $634.

ciples consistently applied throughout the periods indicated and
present fairly the financial condition of the Holding Company and
the Cabinet Company at the respective dates indicated and (in the
case of the Audited Financials) the results of operations and cash
flows of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company for the
respective periods indicated, except that the Interim Financials
are subject to year-end audit adjustments, do not contain notes and
do not reflect any provision for deferred income taxes.

business, properties, financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company that could
have a Material Adverse Effect.
(c) Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (i) as and to the
extent reflected in the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Holding Company and the Cabinet Company as at May 1, 1993 included
in the Audited Financials or in the notes to the Audited Financials

Since May 1, 1993, neither the Holding Company nor the Cabinet
Company has incurred any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether
due or to become due), except (w) as and to the extent reflected in
the Interim Financials, (x) as disclosed in Schedule 2.1.4 or any

principles, consistently applied, except that the Interim
Financials are subject to year-end audit adjustments, do not

the policies of general liability, property, auto, workers'
compensation, product liability, life and other forms of insurance
providing insurance coverage for the Holding Company and the
Cabinet Company. (The Cabinet Company maintains in force certain
group life insurance plans, which are listed on Schedule 2.1.13.) 
Each of such policies is in full force and effect and no notice of
termination or nonrenewal with respect to any such policy has been

no outstanding unpaid premiums, and there are no amounts due and
payable with respect to outstanding borrowings incurred to fund
insurance premiums which have not been paid when due. There are no
provisions for retroactive or retrospective premium adjustments,
except those for which adequate reserves have been recorded on the
books and records of the Company in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Neither the Holding Company nor
the Cabinet Company has knowledge of any state of facts or the
occurrence of any event which either of them reasonably believes
will form the basis of any claim against the Holding Company or the
Cabinet Company which might materially increase the insurance
premiums payable under any such policy. Schedule 2.1.5 also
contains a true and complete description of all outstanding bonds
and other surety arrangements issued or entered into in connection
with the business and operations of the Holding Company and the
Cabinet Company. No consents by any party to such policies are
required in order for the Sellers to execute, deliver and perform
this Agreement and for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the knowledge of the Sellers, there are no
existing circumstances that entitle such insurers to refuse
liability under their respective policies, and no other person has
the right to receive an interest in the proceeds of such policies.

ule 2.1.6 and (b) as to Environmental Matters, there is no action,
claim, suit or proceeding pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Holding Company or the Cabinet Company, threatened by or against or
affecting the Holding Company or the Cabinet Company and there is

Company or the Cabinet Company, threatened against or affecting the
Holding Company or the Cabinet Company (in each case before any
court or governmental or regulatory authority or body and in each
case whether or not the defense thereof or liability in respect
thereof is covered by policies of insurance), that could, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect,
or that challenges the validity of this Agreement or the consumma-
tion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Holding
Company nor the Cabinet Company is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree that could have a Material
Adverse Effect or could interfere materially with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.
2.1.7 Compliance with Laws, Permits. (a) Compliance
with Laws. Except (a) as set forth on Schedule 2.1.7 and (b) as to
Environmental Matters, neither the Holding Company nor the Cabinet
Company has received any notice or has any knowledge that the
Holding Company or the Cabinet Company is in violation of, or
default under, any judgment, order or decree of any court or admin-
istrative agency or any law, statute, ordinance, rule or regula-
tion, of any foreign, federal, state or local government or any
other governmental department or agency (including without
limitation, any laws or regulations relating to anti-competitive
practices, discrimination, employment, health, transportation and
safety), which violations and defaults could, either individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or interfere
materially with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.
(b) Permits. The Holding Company and the Cabinet
Company hold all permits, licenses, franchises and other
authorizations from governmental authorities (collectively,
"Governmental Permits") required to own, lease, operate or use the

their business as now being conducted, other than (a) those the
failure to hold which could not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) as to Environmental Matters. 
After giving effect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Sellers of the transactions
contemplated hereby in the manner contemplated hereby and the
ownership and operation by the Purchaser of the business and
properties of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company subse-
quent to the Closing in substantially the same manner as previously
owned and operated by the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company
(assuming no circumstance peculiar to the Purchaser unknown to the
Holding Company and the Cabinet Company that is not applicable to
them), each of the Governmental Permits (except for such incidental
licenses, permits and other authorizations which would be readily
obtainable by any qualified applicant without undue burden in the
event of any lapse, termination, cancellation or forfeiture there-
of) will continue to be valid, subsisting and in full force and
effect without (i) the occurrence of any breach, default or
forfeiture of rights thereunder or (ii) the consent, approval, or
act of or the making of any filing with, any governmental body,
regulatory commission or other party.
2.1.8 Tax Matters. (a) General. Each of the Holding
Company and the Cabinet Company (i) has filed on a timely basis all
United States federal tax returns required by law to be filed by it
and has filed on a timely basis all state, local and foreign tax
returns required by law to be filed by it (including, without
limitation, tax returns for all income, franchise, property, sales,
use, excise, escheat, intangible, employment, withholding and
service taxes) (except to the extent that the failure so to file
could not have a Material Adverse Effect) and (ii) has paid on a
timely basis all such taxes, penalties and additions to tax
relating to such taxes and interest on such taxes, penalties and
additions to tax (all income, franchise, property, sales, use,
excise, escheat, intangible, employment, withholding and service
taxes and any penalties and additions to tax related to such taxes
and interest on all such taxes, penalties and additions to tax
being referred to in this section 2.1.8 collectively as "Taxes" and
all returns relating to such Taxes being referred to in this sec-
tion 2.1.8 as "Tax Returns") levied upon it or its properties as
shown on the returns referred to in clause (i), other than those
that are presently payable without penalty, as to which sufficient
reserves have been established in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles on the books and records of the
Holding Company and the Cabinet Company. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.1.8, for all fiscal years ended on or prior to May 1,
1993 and for the period ended November 27, 1993, each of the
Holding Company and the Cabinet Company has established on their
books and records reserves in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for the payment of any Taxes not yet due and
payable. Each of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company has
made all required declarations of estimated United States federal
and all applicable state and local income taxes and have paid all
taxes as shown on such declarations. All monies required to be
held by the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company from employees
of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company for income taxes,
social security and other payroll taxes have been collected or
withheld, and either paid to the respective governmental agencies,
set aside in accounts for such purpose, or accrued, reserved
against and entered upon the books of the Holding Company. All
proper amounts have been collected or withheld by the Holding
Company and the Cabinet Company for all other Taxes payable or
anticipated to be payable. There are no liens for Taxes upon the
assets of the Holding Company or the Cabinet Company, except liens
for Taxes that are not yet due. Except as set forth on Schedule
2.1.8, and except in connection with an election (whether deemed or
actual) by the Purchaser under section 338 or 336(e) of the Code,
the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement will not
cause any Taxes to be payable (other than by the Sellers) or cause
any lien, charge, or encumbrance to secure any Taxes to be created
either immediately or upon the nonpayment of any Tax (other than on
the properties or assets of the Sellers). The Holding Company's
United States Tax Returns have been audited, or the time for audit
has expired, for periods ended through April 29, 1989 and, to the
best of the Holding Company's and the Cabinet Company's knowledge,
there are no pending tax examinations or audits of their respective
Tax Returns. Neither the United States Internal Revenue Service
nor any other taxing authority is now asserting or to the best
knowledge of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company
threatening to assert against the Holding Company or the Cabinet
Company any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes, and, to the
best knowledge of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company,
there is no basis for the assertion of any such deficiency or claim
which, if successfully asserted, could have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.1.8, neither the Holding
Company nor the Cabinet Company has granted any waiver of any
statute of limitation with respect to, or any extension of a period
for the assessment of, any United States federal, state, county or
municipal or any Taxes. The Holding Company and the Cabinet
Company have delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies of all
federal income tax returns (including amended returns) and tax
audit reports, if any, for the last six fiscal years.

the Cabinet Company has retained any broker or finder in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby so as to give rise to any
claim against the Purchaser for any brokerage or finder's
commission, fee or similar compensation.
2.1.10 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth
in Schedule 2.1.10, since May 1, 1993, neither the Holding Company
nor the Cabinet Company has (a) issued, sold or delivered or agreed
to issue, sell or deliver any additional shares of its capital
stock or any options, warrants or rights to acquire any such capi-
tal stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
capital stock, (b) mortgaged, pledged or subjected to any lien,

Company or the Cabinet Company and neither the Holding Company nor
the Cabinet Company, nor, to the best knowledge of the Holding
Company and the Cabinet Company, any other party to any of the Con-
tracts, is (or, with notice or lapse of time or both, would be) in
default in any respect, which defaults could in the aggregate have
a Material Adverse Effect or give rise to the right of any holder
of indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof.
(c) No Contract or any other agreement between the
Holding Company or the Cabinet Company and any of the Sellers or
any of the Sellers' Affiliates will continue in effect after the
Closing. Assuming the obtaining of any necessary consents, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by
the Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby in the manner
contemplated hereby and the ownership and operation by the
Purchaser of the business and properties of the Holding Company and
the Cabinet Company subsequent to the Closing in substantially the
same manner as previously owned and operated by the Holding Company
and the Cabinet Company (assuming no circumstance peculiar to the
Purchaser unknown to the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company
that would not be applicable to them) will not cause any amounts

limitation, pursuant to any change of control provisions that may
be contained therein.
2.1.13 Compliance with ERISA. (a) Schedule 2.1.13 sets

Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and each bonus,
deferred or incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option,
severance or termination pay plan or program that is maintained or
contributed to by the Holding Company or the Cabinet Company for
the benefit of any of their respective employees or former
employees (the "Plans"). With respect to each of the Plans, the
Holding Company has heretofore made available to the Purchaser (or

complete copies of each of the following documents: (i) the Plan
and related trust or other funding document described in

financial statements described in Schedule 2.1.4, if any, prepared
with respect to each Plan.
(b) Each Plan has been administered and operated in
material compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA and
the Code and no such Plan is subject to section 412 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA. No liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") has been or is expected to be incurred by
the Holding Company or the Cabinet Company or any other trade or
business that is treated as a member of the same "controlled group"
of, or under "common control" with, the Holding Company or the
Cabinet Company pursuant to section 4001(b) of ERISA or section 412
of the Code (a "Related Person"). Neither the Holding Company nor
any Plan nor any trust thereunder nor, to the knowledge of the
Holding Company, any fiduciary of any Plan has engaged in any
prohibited transaction that has resulted or is reasonably expected
to result in the imposition of any tax pursuant to section 4975(a)
or (b) of the Code or penalty pursuant to section 409 or section
502(i) of ERISA on the Holding Company or the Cabinet Company, such
Plan or such trust. No Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the
meaning of section 3(37) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer" plan
(within the meaning of section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA). Each Plan
that is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to that effect.
(c) There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of
the Holding Company or the Cabinet Company, threatened claims of
any employee or former employee of the Holding Company or the
Cabinet Company against or otherwise involving any of the Plans
(other than routine claims for benefits).
(d) All contributions (including insurance premiums)
required to have been made by the Holding Company or the Cabinet
Company to any Plan pursuant to the applicable provisions of any
Plan, the Code or ERISA have been made within the time prescribed
by such provisions of the Code and ERISA and all contributions
required to have been made by each Related Person to any other
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of section 3(3) of ERISA)
of any Related Person pursuant to section 412 of the Code have been
made within the time prescribed by section 412 of the Code.
(e) No events have occurred and no condition with
respect to a Plan exists that would subject the Holding Company,
the Cabinet Company or the Purchaser to any material tax under
section 4971, 4977 or 4979 of the Code or to a material fine under
section 502(c) of ERISA. Neither the Holding Company nor the
Cabinet Company retains the services of any leased employees (as
such term is defined in section 414(n) of the Code) that must be
taken into account with respect to any Plan.
(f) On or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing
Date, no Plan maintained by the Holding Company or the Cabinet
Company will be (i) terminated by the Holding Company or the
Cabinet Company, (ii) amended by the Holding Company or the Cabinet
Company in any manner which would materially increase the benefits
accrued by any participant thereunder, or (iii) amended by the
Holding Company or the Cabinet Company in any manner which would
materially increase the cost of maintaining such Plan to the
Holding Company, the Cabinet Company or the Purchaser.
(g) Neither the Holding Company nor the Cabinet Company
sponsors or maintains a VEBA, other than one which has no assets or
liabilities. Each "employee welfare benefit plan" (as such term is
defined in section 3(1) of ERISA) which is a "group health plan"
(as such term is defined in section 4980(g)(2)) of the Code)
complies with the applicable requirements of section 4980B of the
Code.
(h) The Holding Company and the Cabinet Company have
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical
Leave Act and have operated each Plan in material compliance with
such laws.

3.3 Efforts to Consummate Transaction. The Purchaser
and each Seller shall use their reasonable efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions required to consummate the transactions

supply, or cause to be filed or supplied, all material
applications, notifications and information required to be filed or
supplied by them or the Holding Company pursuant to applicable law
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including
filings and reports pursuant to the HSR Act. The Purchaser shall
use its reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals
from governmental authorities and third parties required to be ob-
tained by the Purchaser for the consummation by the Purchaser of
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than any consents and
approvals the failure of which to be obtained, either in any case
or in the aggregate, could not have a material adverse effect on
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Seller shall use such
Seller's reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals
from governmental authorities and third parties and waivers by the
Holding Company and The Clayton & Dubilier Private Equity Fund
Limited Partnership required to be obtained by such Seller for the
consummation by such Seller of the transactions contemplated

ing by the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company of all consents
and approvals from governmental authorities and third parties
required to be obtained by the Holding Company and the Cabinet
Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated

3.4 Non-Solicitation. Each Seller, severally and not
jointly, covenants that from the date hereof through the Closing

permit any employee, representative, financial or legal advisor or
agent of such Seller to, make, solicit, assist or encourage the
initiation of any inquiries or proposals or participate in any
negotiations with any party or furnish any confidential information
to any party (other than the Purchaser and its employees,
representatives, advisors and agents) concerning the acquisition of
the Shares or any portion of the assets, properties or business of
the Holding Company or the Cabinet Company, other than dispositions
of inventories and other assets in the ordinary course of business.
3.5 Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) Delivery and
Review of Closing Balance Sheet. As promptly as practicable, but
no later than 45 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers will
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Purchaser (i) the Closing
Financial Statements, accompanied by the auditors' report thereon
from a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
selected by the Sellers (which may be Ernst & Young, the Holding
Company's independent public accountants), and (ii) a certificate
of the Company, setting forth the Closing Net Book Value and the
Closing Working Capital, together with supporting calculations in
reasonable detail (the "Adjustment Certificate"). The Purchaser
and its accountants shall be given an opportunity to discuss with
the Sellers' accountants matters relating to the scope of the audit
to be performed (including, without limitation, determination of
sample sizes for accounts receivable and inventory observations) 
and, prior to the delivery of the Closing Financial Statements, the
Purchaser and its accountants shall be given an opportunity to
review draft financial statements and to discuss with the Sellers'
accountants significant audit issues that arose in the course of
their audit. The Purchaser shall have 30 days from the date on
which the Closing Balance Sheet and the Adjustment Certificate are
delivered to it to review such documents (the "Review Period"). 
The Purchaser and its accountants shall be provided with full
access to the work papers of the Sellers' accountants in connection
with such review. If the Purchaser asserts that any item or amount
shown or reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Adjustment
Certificate or that the calculation of the Closing Net Book Value
or the Closing Working Capital, was arrived at other than in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
basis consistent with those used in the preparation of the Balance
Sheet (other than with regard to the application of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109), the Purchaser may, on or
prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to the
Sellers setting forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or
amount and the basis for the Purchaser's disagreement therewith,
together with supporting calculations (the "Dispute Notice"). If
no Dispute Notice is received by the Sellers on or prior to the
last day of the Review Period, the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Adjustment Certificate shall be deemed accepted by the Purchaser.
(b) Disputes. Within 30 days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice if the Purchaser and the Sellers shall be unable
despite their reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute set forth
in the Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly
retain another nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants mutually acceptable to them. Such independent firm
shall review the Closing Balance Sheet (and, if necessary or
appropriate in their judgment, any related work papers of the
Sellers' accountants), the Adjustment Certificate and the Dispute
Notice, and shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later
than 45 days following the date of their engagement, deliver to the
Sellers and the Purchaser a report (the "Adjustment Report")
setting forth, in reasonable detail, their determination with
respect to all of the disputed items or amounts specified in the
Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made to the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Adjustment Certificate and the
calculation of the Closing Net Book Value or the Closing Working
Capital to reflect such determination, together with supporting
calculations. The Adjustment Report shall be final and binding
upon the Purchaser and the Sellers. The Sellers shall pay one-
half, and the Purchaser shall pay one-half, of the fees and
expenses of such independent firm incurred in preparing and deliv-
ering such Adjustment Report.
(c) Adjustment and Payment. The Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (i) the excess, if any, of
the Target Net Book Value over the Closing Net Book Value plus (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Target Working Capital over the Closing
Working Capital; in each case based on the Closing Net Book Value
and the Closing Working Capital determined pursuant to sec-
tion 3.5(a) or 3.5(b), as the case may be. Any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this section 3.5 shall be paid by the
Sellers in the manner set forth hereafter in this paragraph (c),
two business days after the date on which the Adjustment Report is
delivered to the Sellers and the Purchaser or, if no Dispute Notice
is received by the Sellers on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period, then on the business day following the last day of
the Review Period. Any such payment shall be made in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the
Purchaser designated at least two business days prior to the date
on which such payment is scheduled to be made.
The purchase price adjustment payable pursuant to this
section 3.5 shall be paid by application of the Escrow Amount in
the manner provided in the Escrow Agreement. If the Escrow Amount
shall be insufficient to pay in full the amount of the purchase
price adjustment, the Sellers hereby jointly and severally agree to
pay the deficiency to the Purchaser, and the Sellers each agree
that in such event the Purchaser may proceed against any one of
them for the full payment of the purchase price adjustment, without
proceeding against any of the others.
The parties acknowledge that the Purchaser may receive
from one or more of the Sellers the full amount of the purchase
price adjustment, by payment by such Seller or Sellers of amounts
in excess of such Seller or Seller's proportionate share of the
purchase price adjustment. In such event, each Seller agrees to
pay to the Seller or Sellers which shall have paid such amounts to
the Purchaser pursuant to this section 3.5 its proportionate share
of such purchase price adjustment, determined as provided in
paragraph V of the Custody Agreements, to reimburse the paying
Seller or Sellers for amounts paid by them in excess of their
proportionate shares. In addition, the Purchaser will cause the
Holding Company to assign to such Seller or Sellers who shall have
paid such amounts to the Purchaser all of the Holding Company's
rights to receive from the Option Holders all amounts the Holding
Company may then be entitled to receive from the Option Holders in
payment of the purchase price adjustment pursuant to paragraph 5 of
the Option Cancellation Agreements.
3.6 Environmental Survey. (a) Prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser shall cause to be conducted by a reputable firm of
environmental consultants selected by the Purchaser (the
"Environmental Consultants") an environmental survey of the Owned
Property and such other environmental investigation relating to the
Operations of the Holding Company and the Cabinet Company as may be
satisfactory to the Purchaser. Such survey and investigation shall
be at the Purchaser's sole expense. The Sellers will cause the
Holding Company and the Cabinet Company to furnish to the Purchaser
and the Environmental Consultants full and free access to the Owned
Property and to such books, records and documents relating to the
Owned Property and to the business and Operations of the Holding
Company and the Cabinet Company as the Purchaser may reasonably
request in connection with such environmental survey and
investigation. The Purchaser will cause the Environmental
Consultants, upon the request of any Seller, to provide the Sellers
with informal periodic reports (but no less frequently than weekly)
of their findings during the course of their survey and inves-
tigation. The Purchaser will use its reasonable efforts to complete
such environmental survey and investigation by the fifth business
day prior to January 31, 1994 (or such other date as the parties
hereto may have agreed pursuant to section 1.2).
(b) At the conclusion of such environmental survey and
investigation, but not later than the fifth business day prior to
the Closing, the Purchaser will cause the Environmental Consultants
to deliver to the Sellers a certificate setting forth in reasonable
detail each Material Environmental Cost (the "Environmental
Certificate") determined as a result of such survey and
investigation. The Sellers shall have four business days from the
date on which the Environmental Certificate is delivered to them to
review the Environmental Certificate and, if they so elect, to
cause the Environmental Certificate to be reviewed by a reputable
firm of environmental consultants selected by the Sellers (the
"Sellers' Consultants"). If the Sellers' Consultants shall assert
that any item of Material Environmental Cost set forth on the
Environmental Certificate is incorrect in any material respect, the
Sellers may, on or prior to the Closing Date, deliver a notice to
the Purchaser setting forth each disputed item or amount (the
"Environmental Dispute Notice"). The Sellers, within ten business
days after delivery of the Environmental Dispute Notice, shall
deliver a supplemental notice setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for their disagreement with each of the items of Material
Environmental Cost covered by the Environmental Dispute Notice.
(c) If an Environmental Dispute Notice shall be
delivered, the Closing shall automatically be adjourned to the
thirtieth day following the date of delivery thereof (or, if such
thirtieth day shall not be a business day, to the next following
business day), and the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
paragraph (d) of this section 3.6 shall be complied with.
(d) Within five days after delivery of the Environmental
Dispute Notice, if the Purchaser and the Sellers shall be unable
despite their reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute set forth
in the Environmental Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Sellers
shall jointly retain another reputable firm of environmental
consultants mutually acceptable to them. Such firm shall review
the Environmental Certificate, the Environmental Dispute Notice and
the environmental audit reports and other documentation prepared by
or for the Environmental Consultants and the Sellers' Consultants
in the course of their respective surveys and investigations, and
shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later than 25
days following the date of their engagement, deliver to the Sellers
and the Purchaser a report (the "Environmental Adjustment Report")
setting forth, in reasonable detail, their determination with
respect to all of the disputed items or amounts specified in the
Environmental Dispute Notice, together with appropriate supporting
calculations. The Environmental Adjustment Report shall be final
and binding upon the Purchaser and the Sellers. The Sellers shall
pay one-half, and the Purchaser shall pay one-half, of the fees and
expenses of such independent firm incurred in preparing and
delivering such Environmental Adjustment Report.

the conditions herein set forth the Transferor may, at its
option, convey, transfer and assign to the Company, and the
Company shall accept such conveyance, transfer and assignment
from the Transferor, without recourse except as provided herein,
undivided percentage ownership interests in the Receivables, to-
gether with Related Security and Collections with respect there-
to, from time to time.

SECTION 2.2. Transfers; Company Certificate; Eligible
Receivables. (a) Incremental Transfers. On and after the
Effective Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
herein set forth the Transferor may, at its option, convey,
transfer and assign to the Company, and the Company shall accept
such conveyance, transfer and assignment from the Transferor,
without recourse except as provided herein, undivided percentage
ownership interests in the Receivables, together with Related
Security and Collections with respect thereto (each, an
"Incremental Transfer") from time to time for an aggregate Trans-
fer Price not to exceed the Maximum Net Investment; provided that
the Company shall not accept any such transfer if it is unable to
obtain funds therefor in the commercial paper market or under the
Liquidity Provider Agreement. The Transferor shall by notice
given by telefax offer to convey, transfer and assign to the
Company undivided percentage ownership interests in the Receiv-
ables at least three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed date
of transfer. Each such notice shall specify the desired Transfer

of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) and the desired date of such
Incremental Transfer, together with the desired Tranche Period
(or range) related thereto as required by Section 2.3. The
Company shall, by notice given by telephone or telefax, accept
such offer to convey, transfer and assign undivided percentage
ownership interests. Each notice of proposed Transfer shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Transferor and the Transferor
shall indemnify the Company against any loss or expense incurred
by the Company, either directly or through the Liquidity Provider
Agreement as a result of any failure by the Transferor to
complete such Incremental Transfer including, without limitation,
any loss (including loss of anticipated profits) or expense in-
curred by the Company, either directly or pursuant to the
Liquidity Provider Agreement, by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of funds acquired by the Company or the Liquidity
Provider (including, without limitation, funds obtained by
issuing commercial paper or promissory notes or obtaining depos-
its as loans from third parties) for the Company to fund such
Incremental Transfer.
On the date of the initial Incremental Transfer, the Company
shall deliver written confirmation to the Transferor of the
Transfer Price, the Tranche Period and the Tranche Rate relating
to such Transfer and the Transferor shall deliver to the Company
the Transfer Certificate in the form of Exhibit F hereto (the

Price, the Tranche Period, the Transfer Date and the Tranche Rate
applicable to such Incremental Transfer. The Company shall
indicate the amount of the Incremental Transfer together with the
date thereof as well as any decrease in the Net Investment on the
grid attached to the Transfer Certificate. The Transfer Certifi-
cate shall evidence the Incremental Transfers. Following each
Incremental Transfer, the Company shall deposit to the
Transferor's account at the location indicated on the signature

(b) Reinvestment Transfers. On each Business Day
occurring after the initial Incremental Transfer hereunder and
prior to the Termination Date, the Transferor hereby agrees to
convey, transfer and assign to the Company, and in consideration
of Transferor's agreement to maintain at all times prior to the
Termination Date a Net Receivables Balance in an amount at least
sufficient to maintain the Percentage Factor at an amount not
greater than the Maximum Percentage Factor, the Company hereby
agrees to purchase from the Transferor undivided percentage
ownership interests in each and every Receivable, together with
Related Security and Collections with respect thereto, to the
extent that Collections are available for such Transfer in
accordance with Section 2.5, such that after giving effect to
such Transfer, (i) the amount of the Company's Net Investment at
the close of business on such Business Day shall be equal to the
amount of the Company's Net Investment at the close of business
on the Business Day immediately preceding such Business Day plus
the Transfer Price of any Incremental Transfer made on such day,
if any, and (ii) the Company's Transferred Interest in each
Receivable, together with Related Security and Collections with
respect thereto, shall be equal to its Transferred Interest in
each other Receivable, together with Related Security and Collec-
tions with respect thereto.

(c) All Transfers. Each Transfer shall consti-
tute a purchase of undivided percentage ownership interests in
each and every Receivable, together with Related Security and
Collections with respect thereto, then existing, as well as in
each and every Receivable, together with Related Security and
Collections with respect thereto, which arises at any time after
the date of such Transfer. The Company's aggregate undivided
percentage ownership interest in the Receivables, together with
Related Security and Collections with respect thereto, shall
equal the Percentage Factor in effect from time to time.

(d) Company Certificate. The Transferor shall
issue to the Company the Company Certificate, in the form of
Exhibit M, on or prior to the date hereof.

(e) Percentage Factor. The Percentage Factor
shall be initially computed as of the opening of business of the
Collection Agent on the date of the initial Incremental Transfer
hereunder. Thereafter until the Termination Date, the Percentage
Factor shall be automatically recomputed as of the close of
business of the Collection Agent on each day (other than a day
after the Termination Date). The Percentage Factor shall remain
constant from the time as of which any such computation or
recomputation is made until the time as of which the next such
recomputation, if any, shall be made. The Percentage Factor, as
computed as of the day immediately preceding the Termination
Date, shall remain constant at all times on and after such
Termination Date until the date on which the Net Investment shall
become zero and the Aggregate Unpaids shall have been paid in
full.

(f) Assignment. The Transferor hereby irrevoca-
bly assigns to the Company all of its right, title and interest
in and to the Purchase Agreement. The Designated Subsidiaries,
by their signature hereto, acknowledge such assignment in favor
of the Company. 

SECTION 2.3. Selection of Tranche Periods and Tranche
Rates.

(a) At all times hereafter, but prior to the
occurrence of a Termination Event, the Transferor shall, subject
to the limitations described below, request Tranche Periods and
allocate a portion of the Net Investment to each selected Tranche
Period, so that the aggregate amounts allocated to outstanding
Tranche Periods at all times shall equal the Net Investment. The
Transferor shall give the Company irrevocable notice by telephone
of the new requested Tranche Period and whether the requested
Tranche Rate applicable thereto shall be the CP Rate, the BR
Rate, the CD Rate or the Eurodollar Rate (a "Tranche Selection
Notice") at least (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the
expiration of any then existing Tranche Period if the Tranche
Rate to be applicable to the new requested Tranche Period shall
be the Eurodollar Rate, (ii) two (2) Business Days prior to the
expiration of any then existing Tranche Period if the Tranche
Rate to be applicable to the new requested Tranche Period shall
be the BR Rate or the CD Rate, and (iii) one (1) Business Day
prior to the expiration of any then existing Tranche Period if
the Tranche Rate to be applicable to the new requested Tranche
Period shall be the CP Rate; provided, however, that the Company
may select, in its sole discretion, any such new Tranche Period
and Tranche Rate if (i) the Transferor fails to provide such
notice on a timely basis or (ii) the Company determines, in its
sole discretion, that the Tranche Rate requested by the
Transferor is unavailable or for any reason commercially
undesirable or the Company determines, in its sole discretion,
that the Tranche Period requested by the Transferor is not
available. If the Company determines that the Tranche Period
requested by the Transferor is not available, the Company shall,
to the extent practicable, consult with the Transferor as to the
desired Tranche Period. If, as a result of a lack of liquidity
in respect of the Commercial Paper or otherwise, the Liquidity
Provider acquires a Purchased Interest with respect to the
Receivables pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Provider
Agreement, the Liquidity Provider may exercise the right of
selection granted to the Company hereby, and the portion of the
Net Investment allocated to each selected Tranche Period shall
equal, to the extent practicable, the portion of the Net
Investment allocated to the Tranche Period that immediately
preceded such new Tranche Period. The Company confirms that it
is its intention to allocate all or substantially all of the Net
Investment to one or more CP Tranche Periods; provided that the
Company may determine from time to time, in its sole discretion,
that funding such Net Investment by means of one or more CP
Tranche Periods is not commercially desirable. In the case of
any Tranche Period outstanding upon the occurrence of a
Termination Event, such Tranche Period shall end on the date of
such occurrence.

(b) At all times on and after the occurrence of a
Termination Event, the Company or the Liquidity Provider , as
applicable, shall select all Tranche Periods and Tranche Rates
applicable thereto.

Notwithstanding the limitation on recourse under Section 2.1, the
Transferor shall pay, as and when due in accordance with this
Agreement, all fees hereunder, all amounts payable pursuant to

Company's Commercial Paper notes to the extent such notes were
issued in order to fund the Transferred Interest in an amount in
excess of the Transfer Price of an Incremental Transfer. The
Transferor shall pay to the Collateral Agent, on each day on
which Commercial Paper is issued by the Company, the Dealer Fee
as set forth in the Fee Letter. Discount shall accrue with re-
spect to each Tranche on each day occurring during the Tranche
Period related thereto. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit in
any way the obligations of the Transferor to pay the amounts set
forth in this Section 2.4.

SECTION 2.5. Non-Liquidation Settlement and Reinvest-
ment Procedures. On each day after the date of any Incremental
Transfer but prior to the Termination Date and provided that no
Potential Termination Event shall have occurred and be continu-
ing, the Collection Agent shall out of the Percentage Factor of
Collections received on or prior to such day and not previously
applied or accounted for: (i) set aside and hold in trust for
the Company (or deposit into the Collection Account if so
required pursuant to Section 2.12) an amount equal to all Dis-
count, the Program Fee, the Unused Fee and the Servicing Fee ac-
crued through such day and not so previously set aside or paid
and (ii) apply the balance of such Percentage Factor of Collec-
tions remaining after application of Collections as provided in
clause (i) of this Section 2.5 to the Transferor, for the benefit
of the Company for the purchase of additional undivided percent-
age interests in each Receivable pursuant to Section 2.2(b). On
the last day of each Tranche Period, from the amounts set aside
as described in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section
2.5, the Collection Agent shall deposit to the Company's account,
an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Discount for such
Tranche Period and shall deposit to its account an amount equal

As provided in Section 6.2(b), the Collection Agent shall remit
to the Transferor, as soon as practicable after receipt, such
portion of Collections not allocated to the Company.

SECTION 2.6. Liquidation Settlement Procedures. If on
the Termination Date, the Percentage Factor is greater than the
Maximum Percentage Factor, then the Transferor shall immediately
pay to the Company from previously received Collections, an
amount equal to the amount such that, when applied in reduction
of the Net Investment, will result in a Percentage Factor less
than or equal to the Maximum Percentage Factor. Such amount
shall be applied by the Company to the reduction of the Net In-
vestment of Tranche Periods selected by the Company. On the
Termination Date and on each day thereafter, and on each day on
which a Potential Termination Event has occurred and is continu-
ing, the Collection Agent shall set aside and hold in trust for
the Company (or deposit into the Collection Account if so
required pursuant to Section 2.12) the Percentage Factor of all
Collections received on such day. On the Termination Date or the
day on which a Potential Termination Event occurs, the Collection
Agent shall deposit to the Company's account any remaining
amounts set aside pursuant to Section 2.5(i) above. On the last
day of each Tranche Period to occur on or after the Termination
Date or during the continuance of a Potential Termination Event,
the Collection Agent shall deposit to the Company's account, the
amounts set aside pursuant to the preceding sentence, together
with any remaining amounts set aside pursuant to Section 2.5(i)
prior to the Termination Date or the day on which a Potential
Termination Event occurs but not to exceed the sum of (i) the ac-
crued Discount for such Tranche Period, (ii) the portion of the
Net Investment allocated to such Tranche Period, and (iii) the
aggregate of all other amounts then owed (whether due or accrued)
hereunder by Transferor to the Company. On such day, the
Collection Agent shall deposit to its account, from the amounts
set aside pursuant to the preceding sentence which remain after
payment in full of the aforementioned amounts, the accrued Ser-
vicing Fee for such Tranche Period. If there shall be
insufficient funds on deposit for the Collection Agent to
distribute funds in payment in full of the aforementioned
amounts, the Collection Agent shall distribute funds first, in
payment of the accrued Discount, second, in payment of all fees
and expenses payable to the Company hereunder, third, if the
Transferor is not the Collection Agent, to the Collection Agent's
account, in payment of the Servicing Fee payable to the
Collection Agent, fourth, in reduction of the Net Investment
allocated to such Tranche Period, fifth, in payment of all other
amounts payable to the Company and sixth, if the Transferor is
the Collection Agent, to its account as Collection Agent, in pay-
ment of the Servicing Fee payable to the Transferor as Collection
Agent. Following the date on which the Net Investment has been
reduced to zero, all accrued Discount and Servicing Fees have
been paid in full and all other Aggregate Unpaids have been paid
in full, (i) the Collection Agent shall recompute the Percentage
Factor, (ii) the Company shall be considered to have reconveyed
to the Transferor any interest in the Receivables (including the
Transferred Interest), (iii) the Collection Agent shall pay to
Transferor any remaining Collections set aside and held by the
Collection Agent pursuant to the second sentence of this Section
2.6 and (iv) the Company shall execute and deliver to the Trans-
feror, at the Transferor's expense, such documents or instruments
as are necessary to terminate the Company's interest in the
Receivables. Any such documents shall be prepared by or on
behalf of the Transferor.

expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and
documents and take all actions as may be necessary or as the
Company may reasonably request in order to perfect or protect the
Transferred Interest or to enable the Company to exercise or
enforce any of its rights hereunder. Without limiting the fore-
going, the Transferor will, upon the request of the Company, in
order to accurately reflect this purchase and sale transaction,
execute and file such financing or continuation statements or
amendments thereto or assignments thereof (as permitted pursuant
to Section 9.6 hereof) as may be requested by the Company and

prior notice thereof and (ii) prepared at Transferor's expense
and delivered to the Company all financing statements, in-

(b) The Collection Agent shall instruct all
Obligors to cause all Collections to be deposited directly with a
Lock-Box Bank. Any Lock-Box Account maintained by a Lock-Box
Bank pursuant to the related Lock-Box Agreement shall be under
the ownership and control of the Collateral Agent. The
Collection Agent shall be permitted to give instructions to the
Lock-Box Banks for so long as either a Collection Agent default
or any other Termination Event has not occurred hereunder. The
Collection Agent shall not add any bank as a Lock-Box Bank to
those listed on Exhibit C unless such bank has entered into a
Lock-Box Agreement. The Collection Agent shall not terminate any
bank as a Lock-Box Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received fifteen (15) days' prior notice of such termi-
nation. If the Transferor or the Collection Agent receives any
Collections or the Transferor is deemed to receive any
Collections pursuant to Section 2.9, the Transferor or the
Collection Agent, as applicable, shall immediately, but in any
event within two Business Days of receipt, remit such Collections
to a Lock-Box Account. If any Designated Subsidiary receives any
Collections, such Designated Subsidiary shall immediately, but in
any event within two Business Days of receipt, remit such Collec-
tions to a Lock-Box Account.

SECTION 2.9. Deemed Collections; Application of Pay-
ments. (a) If on any day the Outstanding Balance of a Receivable
is either (x) reduced as a result of any defective, rejected or
returned goods or services, any cash discount, credit, rebate,
allowance or other dilution factor, any billing adjustment or
other adjustment, or (y) reduced or canceled as a result of a
setoff or offset in respect of any claim by any Person (whether
such claim arises out of the same or a related transaction or an
unrelated transaction), the Transferor shall be deemed to have
received on such day a collection of such Receivable in the
amount of such reduction or cancellation and the Transferor shall
pay to the Collection Agent an amount equal to such reduction or
cancellation which shall be applied by the Collection Agent as a
Collection in accordance with Section 2.5 or 2.6, as applicable. 
Each Designated Subsidiary agrees that it shall be liable,
jointly and severally with the Transferor, for any obligation of
the Transferor under this Section 2.9(a) which relates to or
arises out of a Receivable transferred by such Designated
Subsidiary to the Transferor pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. 
The Net Investment shall be reduced by the amount of such payment
actually received by the Company.

(b)If on any day any of the representations or
warranties in Article III is no longer true with respect to a Re-
ceivable, the Transferor shall be deemed to have received on such
day a Collection of such Receivable in full and the Transferor
shall on such day pay to the Collection Agent an amount equal to
the aggregate Percentage Factor of the Outstanding Balance of
such Receivable and such amount shall be allocated to the Company
by the Collection Agent and applied by the Collection Agent as a
Collection allocable to the Transferred Interest in accordance
with Section 2.5 or 2.6, as applicable. Each Designated
Subsidiary agrees that it shall be liable, jointly and severally
with the Transferor, for any obligation of the Transferor under
this Section 2.9(b) which relates to or arises out of a Re-
ceivable transferred by such Designated Subsidiary to the Trans-
feror pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Net Investment
shall be reduced by the amount of such payment actually received
by the Company.

(c)Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any
indebtedness owed by it to the Transferor shall, except as other-
wise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract
or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Company, be applied
as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor included in the
Transferred Interest (starting with the oldest such Receivable)
to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder
before being applied to any other receivable or other
indebtedness of such Obligor.

SECTION 2.10. Payments and Computations, Etc. All
amounts to be paid or deposited by the Transferor or the
Collection Agent hereunder shall be paid or deposited in
accordance with the terms hereof no later than 11:00 a.m. (New
York City time) on the day when due in immediately available
funds; if such amounts are payable to the Company they shall be
paid or deposited in the account indicated on the signature page
hereof, until otherwise notified by the Company. The Transferor
shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay to the Company upon
demand, interest on all amounts not paid or deposited when due to
the Company hereunder at a rate equal to 2% per annum plus the
Base Rate. All computations of discount, interest and all per
annum fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360
days for the actual number of days (including the first but
excluding the last day) elapsed. Any computations of amounts
payable by the Transferor hereunder to the Company, the Liquidity
Provider or the Credit Support Provider shall be binding absent
manifest error.

SECTION 2.11. Reports. (a) On each Wednesday of each
week (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding
Business Day), the Collection Agent shall prepare and forward to
the Company and the Administrative Agent a Weekly Report certify-
ing as to the calculation of the Net Receivables Balance as of
the close of business on the immediately preceding Business Day.

(b) Prior to the tenth day of each month, the Col-
lection Agent shall prepare and forward to the Company and the
Administrative Agent (i) an Investor Report as of the end of the
last day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Month, (ii) if
requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, a listing
by Obligor of all Receivables together with an aging of such
Receivables and (iii) such other information as the Company or
the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

SECTION 2.12. Collection Account. There shall be
established on the day of the initial Incremental Transfer
hereunder and maintained, for the benefit of the Company, with
the Collateral Agent, a segregated account (the "Collection
Account"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the
funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Company. 
The Collection Agent shall remit daily within two Business Days
of receipt to the Collection Account all Collections received
with respect to any Receivables which are allocable to the
Company pursuant to Section 2.5(i) and Section 2.6; provided,
however, the Collection Agent shall be permitted to make payments
to the Company on the last day of each Tranche Period instead of
depositing funds into the Collection Account on a daily basis for
so long as, and only for so long as no Collection Agent default
and no other Termination Event has occurred hereunder. Funds on
deposit in the Collection Account (other than investment earn-
ings) shall be invested by the Collateral Agent in Eligible
Investments that will mature so that such funds will be available
prior to the last day of each successive Tranche Period following
such investment. On the last day of each calendar month, all
interest and earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on
funds on deposit in the Collection Account shall be retained in
the Collection Account and be available to make any payments re-
quired to be made hereunder (including Discount) to the Company. 
On the date on which the Net Investment is zero and all amounts
payable hereunder have been paid to the Company, any funds re-
maining on deposit in the Collection Account shall be paid to the
Transferor.

consolidate or merge with or into any other Person, or (ii) sell,
lease or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any

a Termination Event or Potential Termination Event.

(e) Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors. 
The Transferor will not, and shall cause each Designated
Subsidiary not to, add or terminate any bank as a Lock-Box Bank
or any account as a Lock-Box Account to or from those listed in

ceeds other than Collections of Receivables.

necessary to reflect such change and to continue the perfection
of the Company's ownership interests or security interests in the

ARTICLE VI

ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTIONS

SECTION 6.1. Appointment of Collection Agent. The
servicing, administering and collection of the Receivables shall
be conducted by such Person (the "Collection Agent") so
designated from time to time in accordance with this Section 6.1. 
Until the Company gives notice to LADD Furniture, Inc. of the
designation of a new Collection Agent, LADD Furniture, Inc. is
hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the duties and
obligations of, the Collection Agent pursuant to the terms
hereof. The Company may, upon the occurrence of any Termination
Event designate as Collection Agent any Person (including itself)
to succeed LADD Furniture, Inc. or any successor Collection
Agent, on the condition in each case that any such Person so
designated shall agree to perform the duties and obligations of
the Collection Agent pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon the
occurrence of a Potential Termination Event or a Termination
Event, the Company may notify any Obligor of the Transferred
Interest.

SECTION 6.2. Duties of Collection Agent.

(a) The Collection Agent shall take or cause to
be taken all such action as may be necessary or advisable to
collect each Receivable from time to time, all in accordance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations, and with the care and
diligence which the Collection Agent employs in servicing similar
receivables for its own account, in accordance with the Credit
and Collection Policy. Each of the Transferor and the Company
hereby appoints as its agent the Collection Agent, from time to
time designated pursuant to Section 6.1, to enforce its
respective rights and interests in and under the Receivables, the
Related Security and the Contracts. The Collection Agent shall
set aside for the account of the Transferor and the Company their
respective allocable shares of the Collections of Receivables in
accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.6. The Collection Agent shall
segregate and deposit to the Company's account the Company's
allocable share of Collections of Receivables when required
pursuant to Article II hereof. So long as no Termination Event
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Transferor may, in
accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the
maturity of Receivables, but not beyond sixty (60) days, and
extend the maturity or adjust the Outstanding Balance as the
Transferor may determine to be appropriate to maximize Collec-
tions thereof; provided, however, that such extension or ad-
justment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a
Delinquent Receivable or a Defaulted Receivable. The Transferor
shall deliver to the Collection Agent and the Collection Agent
shall hold in trust for the Transferor and the Company in accor-
dance with their respective interests, all Records which evidence
or relate to Receivables or Related Security. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, from and after the
occurrence of a Termination Event or a Potential Termination
Event the Company shall have the absolute and unlimited right to
direct the Collection Agent (whether the Collection Agent is the
Transferor or any other Person) to commence or settle any legal
action to enforce collection of any Receivable or to foreclose
upon or repossess any Related Security.

(b) The Collection Agent shall hold for the
benefit of the Transferor Collections received minus the
Percentage Factor of such Collections. On the last day of each
Tranche Period, the Collection Agent shall deduct from such
Collections and pay to the Company in reduction of the Net
Investment any amounts due under Section 2.9 hereof and unpaid
from the Transferor or any Designated Subsidiary and turn the
remainder of such Collections over to the Transferor. In
addition, the Collection Agent shall, as soon as practicable fol-
lowing receipt thereof, turn over to the Transferor any collec-
tions of any indebtedness of any Obligor which is not a Receiv-
able. If the Transferor is not the Collection Agent, the Collec-
tion Agent, by giving three Business Days' prior written notice
to the Company, may revise the percentage used to calculate the
Servicing Fee so long as the revised percentage will not result
in a Servicing Fee that exceeds 110% of the reasonable and
appropriate out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such Collection
Agent incurred in connection with the performance of its obli-
gations hereunder as documented to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Company. The Collection Agent, if other than the Transferor,
shall as soon as practicable upon demand, deliver to the Trans-
feror all Records in its possession which evidence or relate to
indebtedness of an Obligor which is not a Receivable.

(c) On or before 90 days after the end of each
fiscal year of the Collection Agent, beginning with the fiscal
year ending December 31, 1994, the Collection Agent shall cause a
firm of independent public accountants (who may also render other
services to the Collection Agent or the Transferor) to furnish a
report to the Company to the effect that they have (i) compared
the information contained in the Investor Reports delivered
during such fiscal year with the information contained in the
Contracts and the Collection Agent's records and computer systems
for such period, and that, on the basis of the agreed upon
procedures set forth in Exhibit P and such comparison, such firm
will issue an agreed upon procedures report to the Collection
Agent stating that such accountants have performed the procedures
outlined on Exhibit P hereto and stating the results thereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article VI, the Collection Agent, if not the
Transferor, shall have no obligation to collect, enforce or take
any other action described in this Article VI with respect to any
Receivable that is not included in the Transferred Interest other
than to deliver to the Transferor the Collections and documents
with respect to any such Receivable as described in Section
6.2(b).

SECTION 6.3. Rights After Designation of New
Collection Agent. At any time following the designation of a
Collection Agent (other than the Transferor) pursuant to Section
6.1:

(i) The Company may direct that payment
of all amounts payable under any Receivable be made
directly to the Company or its designee.

Company's request, (A) assemble all of the Records, and

it from time to time constituting Collections of
Receivables in a manner acceptable to the Company and
shall, promptly upon receipt, remit all such cash,
checks and instruments, duly endorsed or with duly
executed instruments of transfer, to the Company or its
designee.

(iv) The Transferor hereby authorizes
the Company to take any and all steps in the
Transferor's name and on behalf of the Transferor nec-
essary or desirable, in the determination of the Com-
pany, to collect all amounts due under any and all Re-
ceivables, including, without limitation, endorsing the
Transferor's or any Designated Subsidiary's name on
checks and other instruments representing Collections
and enforcing such Receivables and the related Con-
tracts.

SECTION 6.4. Responsibilities of the Transferor. Any-
thing herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Transferor
shall (i) perform all of its obligations under the Contracts
related to the Receivables to the same extent as if interests in
such Receivables had not been sold hereunder and the exercise by
the Company of its rights hereunder shall not relieve the
Transferor from such obligations, (ii) cause each Designated
Subsidiary to perform all of its obligations under the Contracts
related to the Receivables to the same extent as if interests in
such Receivables had not been sold hereunder or under the
Purchase Agreement and the exercise by the Company of its rights
hereunder shall not relieve the Designated Subsidiaries from such
obligations and (iii) pay when due any taxes, including without
limitation, any sales taxes payable in connection with the
Receivables and their creation and satisfaction. The Company
shall not have any obligation or liability with respect to any
Receivable or related Contracts, nor shall it be obligated to
perform any of the obligations of the Transferor or any
Designated Subsidiary thereunder.

the Company, the Liquidity Provider and the Credit Support 
Provider and any permitted assigns and their respective officers,
directors and employees (collectively, "Indemnified Parties")
from and against any and all damages, losses, claims, liabili-
ties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
(which such attorneys may be employees of the Liquidity Provider,
the Credit Support Provider or the Company) and disbursements
(all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "Indemni-
fied Amounts") awarded against or incurred by any of them arising
out of or as a result of a breach of any representation or
warranty or covenant made by Transferor of this Agreement or the
ownership, either directly or indirectly, by the Company of the
Transferred Interest excluding, however, (i) Indemnified Amounts
to the extent resulting from gross negligence or willful miscon-
duct on the part of an Indemnified Party or (ii) recourse (except
as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) for
uncollectible Receivables. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Transferor and the Designated Subsidiaries,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify each Indemnified Party for

delivered by the Transferor or a Designated Subsidiary
pursuant hereto or pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
which shall have been false or incorrect in any mate-
rial respect when made or deemed made;

(ii) the failure by the Transferor or
any Designated Subsidiary to comply with any applicable
law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable
or the related Contract, or the nonconformity of any
Receivable or the related Contract with any such
applicable law, rule or regulation;

(iii) the failure to vest and maintain
vested in the Company an undivided percentage ownership
interest, to the extent of the Transferred Interest, in
the Receivables free and clear of any Adverse Claim;

(iv) the failure to file, or any delay
in filing, financing statements, continuation state-
ments, or other similar instruments or documents under
the UCC of any applicable jurisdiction or other appli-
cable laws with respect to any Receivable;

(v) any dispute, claim, offset or de-
fense (other than discharge in bankruptcy) of the
Obligor to the payment of any Receivable (including,
without limitation, a defense based on such Receivable
or the related Contract not being legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms), or any other claim
resulting from the sale of merchandise or services
related to such Receivable or the furnishing or failure
to furnish such merchandise or services;

(vi) any failure of the Transferor, as
Collection Agent or otherwise, to perform its duties or
obligations in accordance with the provisions of

the purchase of interests in receivables from one or more Other
Transferors, the Company shall allocate such Indemnified Amounts
which are in connection with the Liquidity Provider Agreement,
the Credit Support Agreement or the credit support furnished by
the Credit Support Provider ratably to the Transferor and each
Other Transferor; and provided, further, that if such Indemnified
Amounts are attributable to the Transferor and not attributable
to any Other Transferor, the Transferor and the Designated
Subsidiaries shall be solely liable for such Indemnified Amounts
or if such Indemnified Amounts are attributable to Other
Transferors and not attributable to the Transferor or a
Designated Subsidiary, such Other Transferors shall be solely
liable for such Indemnified Amounts.

es. (a) If after the date hereof, the adoption of any Law or
bank regulatory guideline or any amendment or change in the
interpretation of any existing or future Law or bank regulatory
guideline by any Official Body charged with the administration,
interpretation or application thereof, or the compliance with any
directive of any Official Body (in the case of any bank
regulatory guideline, whether or not having the force of Law):

(i) shall subject any Indemnified Party
to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to this
Agreement, the Transferred Interest, the Receivables or
payments of amounts due hereunder, or shall change the
basis of taxation of payments to any Indemnified Party
of amounts payable in respect of this Agreement, the
Transferred Interest, the Receivables or payments of
amounts due hereunder or its obligation to advance
funds under the Liquidity Provider Agreement or the
credit support furnished by the Credit Support Provider
or otherwise in respect of this Agreement, the Trans-
ferred Interest or the Receivables (except for changes

Indemnified Party or shall impose on any Indemnified
Party or on the United States market for certificates

condition affecting this Agreement, the Transferred
Interest, the Receivables or payments of amounts due
hereunder or its obligation to advance funds under the
Liquidity Provider Agreement or the credit support
provided by the Credit Support Provider or otherwise in
respect of this Agreement, the Transferred Interest or
the Receivables; or

(iii) imposes upon any Indemnified Party
any other expense (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and expenses
of litigation or preparation therefor in contesting any
of the foregoing) with respect to this Agreement, the
Transferred Interest, the Receivables or payments of
amounts due hereunder or its obligation to advance
funds under the Liquidity Provider Agreement or the
credit support furnished by the Credit Support Provider
or otherwise in respect of this Agreement, the Trans-
ferred Interests or the Receivables,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
such Indemnified Party with respect to this Agreement, the
Transferred Interest, the Receivables, the obligations hereunder,
the funding of any purchases hereunder, the Liquidity Provider
Agreement or the Credit Support Agreement, by an amount deemed by
such Indemnified Party to be material, then, within ten (10) days
after demand by the Company, the Transferor and the Designated
Subsidiaries, jointly and severally, shall be obligated to pay to
the Company such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Indemnified Party for such increased cost or reduction.

(b) If any Indemnified Party shall have
determined that after the date hereof, the adoption of any
applicable Law or bank regulatory guideline regarding capital
adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpreta-
tion thereof by any Official Body, or any directive regarding
capital adequacy (in the case of any bank regulatory guideline,
whether or not having the force of law) of any such Official
Body, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on capital of such Indemnified Party (or its parent) as a conse-
quence of such Indemnified Party's obligations hereunder or with
respect hereto to a level below that which such Indemnified Party
(or its parent) could have achieved but for such adoption,
change, request or directive (taking into consideration its poli-
cies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
such Indemnified Party to be material, then from time to time,
within ten (10) days after demand by the Company, the Transferor
and the Designated Subsidiaries, jointly and severally, shall be
obligated to pay to the Company such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Indemnified Party (or its parent) for
such reduction.

(c) The Company will promptly notify the
Transferor of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring
after the date hereof, which will entitle an Indemnified Party to
compensation pursuant to this Section. A notice by the Company
claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such
amount, the Company may use any reasonable averaging and
attributing methods.

(d) Anything in this Section 8.2 to the contrary
notwithstanding, if the Company enters into agreements for the
acquisition of interests in receivables from one or more Other
Transferors, the Company shall allocate the liability for any
amounts under this Section 8.2 ("Section 8.2 Costs") to the
Transferor and each Other Transferor; and provided, further, that
if such Section 8.2 Costs are attributable to the Transferor or a
Designated Subsidiary and not attributable to any Other Transfer-
or, the Transferor and the Designated Subsidiaries shall be
solely liable for such Section 8.2 Costs or if such Section 8.2
Costs are attributable to Other Transferors and not attributable
to the Transferor or a Designated Subsidiary, such Other
Transferors shall be solely liable for such Section 8.2 Costs.

waivers or consents under this Agreement or the Purchase
Agreement, (b) arising in connection with the Company's
or its agent's enforcement or preservation of rights (in-
cluding, without limitation, the perfection and protec-
tion of the Transferred Interest under this Agreement),
or (c) arising in connection with any audit, dispute,
disagreement, litigation or preparation for litigation
involving this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement (all
of such amounts, collectively, "Transaction Costs").

ant to Sections 3.1(d), 3.1(e), 3.1(g), 3.1(h), 3.1(j),

to accept the reconveyance from the Company of the Trans-
ferred Interest in any Receivable created on and after

sentations and warranties in Sections 3.1(d) and 3.1(j),

cably waive, to the fullest extent it may effectively do
so, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in
such a court and any claim that any such proceeding
brought in such a court has been brought in an inconve-

the right of the Company to bring any action or proceed-
ing against the Transferor, any Designated Subsidiary or
its property in the courts of other jurisdictions. 

(b) This Agreement contains the final and
complete integration of all prior expressions by the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof

this Agreement which are prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be

er, that the Transferor may not assign any of its rights

Agreement shall in any manner restrict the ability of the
Company to assign, participate, grant security interests
in, or otherwise transfer any portion of the Transferred

counting principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to lenders to the Transferor, the Transferor may

in the Fee Letter or the calculation of the Percentage
Interest.

SECTION 9.9. Confidentiality Agreement of the
Company. Subject to Section 9.7, the Company hereby
agrees, and covenants to use its best efforts to cause
the Administrative Agent to agree, that it will not dis-
close the contents of this Agreement or any other propri-
etary or confidential information of the Transferor and
the Designated Subsidiaries to any other Person except
(i) the Company's auditors and attorneys, employees, and

ing good title thereto free and clear of any Adverse
Claims to the Company and that the Transferred Interest

feror hereby grants to the Company, a first priority
perfected security interest in all of the Transferor's
right, title and interest in, to and under the Receiv-
ables, together with Related Security and Collections
with respect thereto, and that this Agreement shall con-
stitute a security agreement under applicable law.

feror shall maintain a register in which it shall record
the name and address of each holder of the Company Cer-
tificate. The initial holder thereof shall be the Compa-
ny. Each holder of the Company Certificate agrees to
give the Transferor prompt notice of any transfer of the
Company Certificate as well as the name and address of
any subsequent holder thereof. Prior to the presentation
of the Company Certificate for registration of transfer,
the Company may treat the Person in whose name the Compa-
ny Certificate is registered as owner hereunder for all
purposes whatsoever.

ARTICLE II

PURCHASE AND CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES

Section 2.1 Sale. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, each Seller hereby sells,
assigns, transfers and conveys to the Buyer, and the Buyer hereby
purchases from each Seller, on the terms and subject to the
conditions specifically set forth herein, all of such Seller's
right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, in, to and under all Receivables outstanding on the
Closing Date and thereafter created by such Seller, in each case,
together with all Related Security and Collections with respect
thereto and all proceeds of the foregoing. The foregoing sale,
assignment, transfer and conveyance does not constitute an
assumption by the Buyer of any obligations of any of the Sellers,
or any other Person to Obligors or to any other Person in con-
nection with the Receivables or under any Related Security or
other agreement and instrument relating to the Receivables.

(b) In connection with the foregoing sale, each Seller
agrees to record and file on or prior to the Closing Date, at its
own expense, a financing statement or statements with respect to
the Receivables and the other property described in Section
2.1(a) sold by such Seller hereunder meeting the requirements of
applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as
are necessary to perfect and protect the interests of the Buyer
created hereby under the applicable UCC against all creditors of
and purchasers from such Seller, and to deliver either the
originals of such financing statements or a file-stamped copy of
such financing statements or other evidence of such filings to
the Buyer on the Closing Date.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) Each Seller agrees that from time to time, at its
expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and
documents and take all actions as may be necessary or as the
Buyer may reasonably request in order to perfect or protect the
interest of the Buyer in the Receivables purchased hereunder or
to enable the Buyer to exercise or enforce any of its rights
hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the each Seller will,
upon the request of the Buyer, in order to accurately reflect
this purchase and sale transaction, execute and file such
financing or continuation statements or amendments thereto or
assignments thereof (as permitted pursuant hereto) as may be
requested by the Buyer and mark its master data processing re-
cords and other documents with a legend describing the purchase
by the Buyer of the Receivables and the subsequent transfer
thereof to Enterprise pursuant to the Transfer Agreement and
stating "An interest in these accounts receivable has been con-
veyed to Enterprise Funding Corporation pursuant to a Transfer
and Administration Agreement dated January 28, 1994." Each
Seller shall, upon request of the Buyer, obtain such additional
search reports as the Buyer shall request. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Buyer shall be permitted to sign
and file continuation statements and amendments thereto and as-
signments thereof without the Seller's signature. Carbon,
photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any
financing statement shall be sufficient as a financing statement.

(e) It is the express intent of each of the Sellers
and the Buyer that the conveyance of the Receivables by each such
Seller to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement be construed as a
sale of such Receivables by each such Seller to the Buyer. It
is, further, not the intention of any of the Sellers and the
Buyer that such conveyance be deemed a grant of a security
interest in the Receivables by any of the Sellers to the Buyer to
secure a debt or other obligation of such Seller. However, in
the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the
Receivables are held to continue to be property of any Seller,
then (i) this Agreement also shall be deemed to be and hereby is
a security agreement within the meaning of the UCC; and (ii) the
conveyance by such Seller provided for in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be and such Seller hereby grants to the Buyer a securi-
ty interest in and to all of such Seller's right, title and
interest in all Receivables outstanding on the Closing Date and
thereafter created by such Seller, in each case, together with
all Related Security and Collections with respect thereto and all
proceeds of the foregoing to secure (1) the rights of the Buyer
and (2) a loan to such Seller in the amount of the Purchase Price
as set forth in this Agreement (the "Secured Obligations"). Each
Seller and the Buyer shall, to the extent consistent with this
Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that,
if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in
the Receivables, such security interest would be deemed to be a
perfected security interest of first priority in favor of the
Buyer under applicable law and will be maintained as such
throughout the term of this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT

Section 3.1 Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for
the Receivables and related property conveyed to the Buyer by
each Seller under this Agreement shall be a dollar amount equal
to (a) for Receivables transferred by such Seller on the date of
the initial Incremental Transfer under the Transfer Agreement,
the product of (i) the aggregate Outstanding Balance of all
Receivables as of the Closing Date and (ii) one minus the
Designated Subsidiary's Discount, and (b) for Receivables trans-
ferred by such Seller on any date thereafter, the product of the
aggregate Outstanding Balance of the Receivables transferred on
such date and (ii) one minus the Designated Subsidiary's Discount
on such date.

Price for Receivables shall be paid or provided for on the
Closing Date and on the last Business Day of each Fiscal Month
thereafter during which Receivables are sold hereunder.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 4.1 Sellers' Representations and Warranties. 
Each Seller (as to itself) represents and warrants to the Buyer
as of the Closing Date, and shall be deemed to represent and war-
rant as of the date of the creation of any Receivable sold to the
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement that:

(a) Corporate Existence and Power. The Seller is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and
has all corporate power and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is now con-
ducted.

(b) Corporate and Governmental Authorization;
Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Seller of this Agreement and each other document or instrument to
be delivered by such Seller hereunder (collectively, "Conveyance
Papers") is within the Seller's corporate powers, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action
by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body,
agency or official (except as contemplated by Section 2.1(d)),
and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provi-
sion of applicable law or regulation or of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Seller or of any agreement, judg-
ment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon
the Seller or result in the creation or imposition of any lien on
assets of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (except as
contemplated by Section 2.1(d)).

(c) Binding Effect. This Agreement constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforce-
able in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bank-
ruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors.

(d) Perfection. Immediately preceding each sale
hereunder, the Seller shall be the owner of all of the
Receivables sold by it hereunder, free and clear of all Adverse
Claims. On or prior to the Closing Date, all financing
statements and other documents required to be recorded or filed
in order to perfect and protect the Buyer's interest in the
Receivables against all creditors of and purchasers from the
Seller will have been either delivered to the Buyer or duly filed
in each filing office necessary for such purpose and all filing
fees and taxes, if any, payable in connection with such filings
shall have been either delivered to the Buyer or paid in full, as
applicable.

(e) Accuracy of Information. All information
heretofore furnished by the Seller to the Buyer for purposes of
or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contem-
plated hereby is, and all such information hereafter furnished by
the Seller to the Buyer will be, true and accurate in every mate-
rial respect, on the date such information is stated or certi-
fied.

(f) Tax Status. The Seller and its Subsidiaries
have filed all United States Federal income tax returns and all
other material tax returns which are required to be filed by them
and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant
to any assessment received by the Seller or any of its Subsidiar-
ies except to the extent that failure to file or pay would not
have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
condition of the Seller or the Buyer's interest in the
Receivables and except for any tax which is being contested in
good faith and by proper proceedings and against which adequate
reserves are being maintained. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Seller and its Subsidiaries in
respect of taxes and other governmental charges are, in the
opinion of the Seller, adequate.

(g) Action, Suits. Except as set forth in Exhib-
it H to the Transfer Agreement, there are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending, or to the knowledge of the Seller threat-
ened, against or affecting the Seller or any Affiliate of the

arbitrator or other body, which may materially adversely affect
the financial condition of the Seller and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole or materially adversely affect the ability of Seller
to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(h) Use of Proceeds. No proceeds of any sale
hereunder will be used by the Seller to acquire any security in

ness and chief executive office of the each Seller is as follows:

respect to itself hereby covenants and agrees with the Buyer as
follows:

During the term of this Agreement, and until all
Receivables sold to the Buyer shall have been paid in full or
written-off as uncollectible, and all amounts owed by such Seller
pursuant to this Agreement have been paid, unless the Buyer
otherwise consents in writing, such Seller covenants and agrees
as follows:

(a) Conduct of Business. The Seller will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, carry on and conduct its busi-
ness in substantially the same manner and in substantially the
same fields of enterprise as it is presently conducted and do all
things necessary to remain duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing as a domestic corporation in its jurisdic-
tion of incorporation and maintain all requisite authority to
conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business
is conducted.

(b) Compliance with Laws. The Seller will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply in all material
respects with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judg-
ments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject.

Records. The Seller will furnish to the Buyer from time to time
such information with respect to the Receivables as the Buyer may
reasonably request, including, without limitation, listings
identifying the Obligor and the Outstanding Balance for each
Receivable. The Seller will at any time and from time to time
during regular business hours permit the Buyer, or its agents or
representatives upon three Business Days notice, (i) to examine
and make copies of and abstracts from all Records and (ii) to
visit the offices and properties of the Seller for the purpose of
examining such Records, and to discuss matters relating to
Receivables or the Seller's performance hereunder with any of the
officers, directors, employees or independent public accountants
of the Seller having knowledge of such matters.

(d) Keeping of Records and Books of Account. The
Seller will maintain and implement administrative and operating
procedures (including, without limitation, an ability to recreate
records evidencing Receivables in the event of the destruction of
the originals thereof), and keep and maintain, all documents,
books, records and other information reasonably necessary or
advisable for the collection of all Receivables (including,
without limitation, records adequate to permit the daily identi-
fication of each new Receivable and all Collections of and
adjustments to each existing Receivable). The Seller will give
the Buyer notice of any material change in the administrative and
operating procedures referred to in the previous sentence.

(e) Performance and Compliance with Receivables and
Contracts. The Seller will at its expense timely and fully
perform and comply with all material provisions, covenants and
other promises required to be observed by it under the Contracts
related to the Receivables. 

(f) Credit and Collection Policies. The Seller will
comply in all material respects with the Credit and Collection
Policy in regard to each Receivable and the related Contract.

(g) Collections. The Seller shall instruct all
Obligors to cause all Collections to be deposited directly to a
Lock-Box Account. The Seller may, however, in connection with
Obligors which would otherwise be over their credit limit if
goods were shipped prior to payment, direct Obligors to make pay-
ments directly to the Seller which shall deposit such Collections
in a Lock-Box Account pursuant to Section 5.1(h) below.

(h) Collections Received. The Seller shall hold in
trust, and deposit, immediately, but in any event not later than
two Business Days of its receipt thereof, to a Lock-Box Account
all Collections received from time to time by the Seller.

(i) Sale Treatment. The Seller shall report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on its financial
statements as a sale of the Receivables to the Buyer.

(j) No Sales, Liens, Etc. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Seller will not sell, assign (by operation
of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or create or suffer
to exist any Adverse Claim upon (or the filing of any financing
statement) or with respect to, any inventory or goods, the sale
of which may give rise to a Receivable or any Receivable or
related Contract, or upon or with respect to any account which
concentrates in a Lock-Box Bank to which any Collections of any
Receivable are sent, or assign any right to receive income in
respect thereof.

(k) No Extension or Amendment of Receivables. The
Seller will not extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of
any Receivable, or amend, modify or waive any term or condition
of any Contract related thereto.

(l) No Change in Business or Credit and Collection
Policy. The Seller will not make any change in the character of
its business or in the Credit and Collection Policy, which change
would, in either case, impair the collectibility of any Receiv-
able.

(m) No Mergers, Etc. The Seller will not (i) consoli-
date or merge with or into any other Person, or (ii) sell, lease
or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other
person; provided, however, that the Seller may consolidate or
merge with a Person if the Seller shall be the surviving entity
and such merger or consolidation does not cause a Termination
Event or Potential Termination Event under the Transfer Agree-
ment.

(n) Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors. The
Seller will not add or terminate any bank as a Lock-Box Bank or
any account as a Lock-Box Account to or from those listed in
Exhibit C to the Transfer Agreement or make any change in its
instructions to Obligors regarding payments to be made to any
Lock-Box Account, unless (i) such instructions are to deposit
such payments to another existing Lock-Box Account or (ii) the
Buyer and the Administrative Agent shall have received written
notice of such addition, termination or change at least 30 days
prior thereto and the Buyer shall have received a Lock-Box Agree-
ment executed by each new Lock-Box Bank or an existing Lock-Box
Bank with respect to each new Lock-Box Account, as applicable.

(o) Deposits to Lock-Box Accounts. The Seller will
not deposit or otherwise credit, or cause or permit to be so
deposited or credited, to any Lock-Box Account cash or cash pro-
ceeds other than Collections of Receivables.

(p) Change of Name, Etc. The Seller shall not change
its name, identity or structure or its chief executive office,
unless at least 10 days prior to the effective date of any such
change the Seller delivers to the Buyer and the Collateral Agent
(i) UCC financing statements, executed by the Seller, necessary
to reflect such change and to continue the perfection of the
Buyer's interest in the Receivables and (ii) the Lock-Box Agree-
ments and, in the case of the Lock-Box Agreements, the Lock-Box
Banks necessary to reflect such change and to continue to enable
the Collateral Agent to exercise its rights contained in Section
2.8 of the Transfer Agreement.

(q) Indemnification. Each Seller agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold the Buyer and any Permitted Assignee harmless
from and against any and all loss, liability, damage, judgment,
claim, deficiency, or expense (including interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts paid in settlement) to
which the Buyer or such Permitted Assignee may become subject
insofar as such loss, liability, damage, judgment, claim, defi-
ciency, or expense arises out of or is based upon a breach by
such Seller of its representations, warranties and covenants
contained herein, or any information certified in any Schedule
delivered by such Seller hereunder, being untrue in any respect
at any time. The obligations of such Seller under this Section
5.1(q) shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Buyer
and shall survive the execution, delivery, performance and
termination of this Agreement regardless of any investigation
made by the Buyer, any Permitted Assignee or on the behalf of any
of them.

(r) ERISA. The Seller shall promptly give the Buyer
written notice upon becoming aware that the Seller is not in com-
pliance in all material respects with ERISA or that any ERISA
lien on any of the Receivables exists.

the date of such loan (as shown on the Schedule) to such maturity
date at a rate per annum equal to: (a) a variable rate equal to: 
the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (ii)
the Prime Rate (such higher rate being the "Variable Rate" and
such loan a "Variable Rate Loan"); or (b) a fixed rate 1 and 1/8%
above the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such loan (such loan a
"Eurodollar Loan"); or (c) a fixed rate as the Bank may in its
discretion offer to the undersigned and the undersigned amy
accept (such loan an "Offered Rate Loan"). Any principal not
paid when due shall bear interest from maturity until paid in
full at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate (as defined
below). Interest shall be payable on the relevant Interest
Payment Date (as defined below). Interest shall be calculated on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days (in the case of Variable
Rate Loans) and 360 days (in the case of the Eurodollar Rate and
Offered Rate Loans) and, in each case, for the actual days
elapsed. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of
the United States and in immediately available funds. Any
extension of time for the payment of the principal of this note
resulting from the due date falling on a non-Banking Day shall be
included in the computation of interest. The date, and Interest
Periods (as defined in the Letter Agreement) of, and the interest
rates with respect to, the loans and any payments of principal
shall be recorded by the Bank on its books and prior to any
transfer of this note (or, at the discretion of the Bank, at any
other time) endorsed by the Bank on the Schedule, which shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error; provided, however,
that the Bank's failure to endorse the Schedule shall not affect
the undersigned's obligations hereunder.

loan and in an amount comparable to the principal amount of such
loan divided by (ii) 1 minus the Reserve Requirement.

(Letterhead of counsel to the Borrower)

[Closing Date] 

The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.
1 Chase Manhattan Plaza
New York, New York 10081

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to Ladd Furniture Inc. (the
"Borrower") in connection with the execution and delivery of that
certain Letter Agreement (the "Letter Agreement") dated as of
[January 28, 1994] between the Borrower and The Chase Manhattan
Bank, N.A. (the "Lender") and the Note (as defined in the Letter
Agreement) executed by the Borrower in connection with the Letter
Agreement. Except as otherwise defined herein, all terms used
herein and defined in the Letter Agreement, the Note or any
agreement delivered thereunder shall have the meanings assigned
to them therein.

In connection with this opinion, we have examined
executed copies of the Facility Documents and such other
documents, records, agreements and certificates as we have deemed
appropriate. We have also reviewed such matters of law as we
have considered relevant for the purpose of this opinion.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and
authority to own its assets and to transact the business in which
it is now engaged or proposed to be engaged, and is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the
laws of each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is
required.

2. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower of the Facility Documents have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action and do not and will not: (a)
contravene the Borrower's charter or bylaws or any applicable law
or any contractual provision binding on or affecting the
Borrower.

3. Each Facility Document is, or when delivered under
the Letter Agreement will be, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.

-2-

4. To the best of our knowledge (after due inquiry),
there are no pending or threatened actions, suits or proceedings
against or affecting the Borrower before any court, governmental
agency or arbitrator, which may, in any one case or in the
aggregate, materially adversely affect the financial condition,
operations, properties or business of the Borrower or the ability
of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Facility
Documents.

Very truly yours,
