Item 5 - Other Events

On March 25, 1994, Pro-Fac Cooperative, Inc. ("Pro-Fac") received
notice from Curtice-Burns Foods, Inc., ("Curtice Burns") that
Curtice Burns intends to discontinue in 1995 a substantial portion
of its historical business with Pro-Fac. Curtice Burns, a
Rochester-based food processing and distribution company and Pro-
Fac's only customer, is controlled by Agway Inc. ("Agway"), a
Northeast farmers' cooperative. The notice principally affects
Pro-Fac's New York fruit and vegetable growers, Illinois and
Nebraska popcorn growers and Northwest potato growers. As a result
of the Curtice Burns action, Pro-Fac has given notice to its
affected members terminating Pro-Fac's obligation to purchase these
crops beginning next year. The Pro-Fac growers who have been
terminated represent more than half of Pro-Fac's membership and
have accounted for over half of the crops delivered by Pro-Fac to
Curtice Burns in the past year.

The termination of these grower contracts in 1995 will cause the
repurchase and cancellation by Pro-Fac of approximately 1.0 million
of Pro-Fac's 2.1 million shares of outstanding common stock by
April 1995 under the terms of the General Marketing Agreement
between Pro-Fac and its members. Under the terms of the Integrated
Agreement between Curtice Burns and Pro-Fac, this will also result
in a $4.9 million reduction in non-interest bearing loans to
Curtice Burns at the same time.

Pro-Fac is protesting this action by Curtice Burns and Agway, and
intends to contest the attempt by Curtice Burns to terminate the
affected businesses. Pro-Fac has previously advised Curtice Burns
that it also disputes the amount that Curtice Burns has stated it
would owe to Pro-Fac were Curtice Burns to terminate the entire
Pro-Fac relationship. The dispute is based in part on Curtice
Burns' nearly $60 million write-down of book value at the end of
the last fiscal year, an action that Pro-Fac believes was not
proper.
