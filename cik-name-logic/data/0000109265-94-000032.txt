binding on and shall inure to the benefit of Borrower, each 
Domestic Subsidiary, Agent, each Lender and each such Person's 
respective successors and assigns, except as otherwise provided 
herein or therein. Neither Borrower nor any Domestic Subsidiary 
may assign, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise convey its rights, 
benefits, obligations or duties hereunder without the prior 
express written consent of Agent and Requisite Lenders. Any such 
purported assignment, transfer, hypothecation or other conveyance 
by Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary without the prior express 
written consent of Agent and Requisite Lenders shall be null and 
void, as if the same shall have never occurred. The terms and 
provisions of this Amendment are for the purpose of defining the 
relative rights and obligations of Borrower, each Domestic 
Subsidiary, Agent and each Lender with respect to the 
transactions contemplated hereby and there shall be no third 
party beneficiaries of any of the terms and provisions of this 
Amendment.

6.2 Entire Agreement. This Amendment, including all 
agreements, certificates, documents, exhibits, schedules and 
other instruments attached hereto or incorporated by reference 
herein, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with 
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other 
understandings, oral or written, with respect to the subject 
matter hereof.

6.3 Fees and Expenses. Borrower agrees to pay on 
demand all fees, costs and expenses incurred by or otherwise due 
to Agent, on behalf of itself and Lenders, in connection with the 
preparation, execution and delivery of this Amendment, together 
with all fees, costs and expenses incurred by or otherwise due to 
Agent, on behalf of itself and Lenders, prior to the date hereof 
which are payable by Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement 
and the Fee Letter.

6.4 Headings. Section headings in this Amendment are 
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not 
constitute a part of this Amendment for any other purpose.

6.5 Severability. Wherever possible, each provision 
of this Amendment shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be 
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of 
this Amendment shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable 
law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of 
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the 
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this 
Amendment.

6.6 Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in 
any number of separate counterparts, each of which shall 
collectively and separately constitute one agreement.

6.7 GOVERNING LAW. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY 
PROVIDED HEREIN, IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF 
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE, THIS AMENDMENT AND THE 
OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED 
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS AND DECISIONS OF THE 
STATE OF ILLINOIS (WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES) 
APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE, AND ANY 
APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BORROWER, EACH 
GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY CONSENTS AND 
AGREES THAT THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF 
COOK, CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE 
JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN 
BORROWER, ANY GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, AGENT AND ANY LENDER 
PERTAINING TO THIS AMENDMENT OR TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR 
RELATING TO THIS AMENDMENT, PROVIDED, THAT AGENT, EACH LENDER, 
BORROWER AND EACH GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY 
APPEALS FROM THOSE COURTS MAY HAVE TO BE HEARD BY A COURT LOCATED 
OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY OF COOK, CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS AND, 
PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT NOTHING IN THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE DEEMED 
OR OPERATE TO PRECLUDE AGENT FROM BRINGING SUIT OR TAKING OTHER 
LEGAL ACTION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION TO REALIZE ON THE 
COLLATERAL OR ANY OTHER SECURITY FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO 
ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF AGENT OR ANY 
LENDER. BORROWER, EACH GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, AGENT AND EACH 
LENDER EXPRESSLY SUBMITS AND CONSENTS IN ADVANCE TO SUCH 
JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR SUIT COMMENCED IN ANY SUCH COURT, 
AND BORROWER, EACH GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, AGENT AND EACH LENDER 
HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH SUCH PERSON MAY HAVE BASED UPON 
LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION, IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON 
CONVENIENS AND HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE GRANTING OF SUCH LEGAL OR 
EQUITABLE RELIEF AS IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY SUCH COURT. 
BORROWER, EACH GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY 
WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS, COMPLAINT AND OTHER 
PROCESS ISSUED IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR SUIT AND HEREBY AGREES THAT 
SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS, COMPLAINTS AND OTHER PROCESS MAY BE MADE 
BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED, IN THE CASE OF 
BORROWER OR ANY GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, TO BORROWER, IN THE CASE OF 
AGENT, TO AGENT, IN THE CASE OF ANY LENDER, TO SUCH LENDER, AT 
ITS RESPECTIVE ADDRESS SET FORTH ON SCHEDULE 11.10 OF THE CREDIT 
AGREEMENT AND THAT SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETED UPON 
THE EARLIER OF ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF OR THREE (3) DAYS AFTER 
DEPOSIT IN THE U.S. MAILS, PROPER POSTAGE PREPAID.

6.8 MUTUAL WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BECAUSE DISPUTES 
ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE 
MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND 
EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL 
LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE 
THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH 
APPLICABLE LAWS. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST COMBINATION OF 
THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, THE 
PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, 
SUIT, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER 
SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, AMONG AGENT, ANY LENDER, 
BORROWER OR ANY DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARY ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED 
WITH, RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED 
AMONG THEM IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AMENDMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS 
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

* * * *

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party hereto has caused this 
Fifth Amendment to be duly executed and delivered by its proper 
and duly authorized officer as of the date first written above.
