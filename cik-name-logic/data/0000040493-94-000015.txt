UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information is provided as required by Regulation S-X of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of June 30, 1994,
Harcourt General, Inc. ("the Company") has sold all of its insurance
businesses to GNA Corporation, an affiliate of General Electric Capital
Corporation ("GECC"). The transaction closed on October 31, 1994. GECC
paid the Company $410.4 million in cash, which includes $10.4 million of
simple interest on the purchase price of $400 million at an annual rate
of 7% for the period from June 17, l994 through the closing date, as
provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements give effect to the sale of the Company's insurance business
and are based on the assumptions set forth below and in the notes to the
pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements. The pro forma
condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended October
31, 1993 reflects the sale as if it occurred on November 1, 1992, except
that the nonrecurring gain on the transaction has been omitted. The pro
forma condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the nine months
ended July 31, 1994 has not been presented, since the insurance business
was reflected as discontinued operations in the Company's filing on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 1994. The pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of July 31, 1994 reflects the sale as if
it occurred on July 31, 1994. The pro forma financial information may
not be indicative of the results of operations or the financial position
which would have been attained had the sale been consummated on either
of the foregoing dates or which may be attained in the future.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial
statements of the Company, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

such calculation, setting forth Buyer's calculation of the Adjusted Closing
Capital. If Buyer agrees with such calculation, or if Buyer fails to deliver

statements and such calculation shall be deemed final. To the extent Buyer and
Seller are in agreement as to the calculation of the Adjusted Closing Capital,
the parties agree to make the corresponding payment contemplated in Section

(e) Within ten Business Days after Seller's timely receipt of any
notice of disagreement with the Closing SAP Financial Statements or the
calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital, Buyer and Seller shall begin, and
shall cause their independent auditors to participate in, good faith
negotiations to resolve such disagreement. If such parties and their
independent auditors are unable to resolve such disagreement within ten
Business Days after such negotiations begin, such disagreement shall be
submitted to a third independent nationally recognized auditing firm selected
by the parties (the "Settlement Auditor") for resolution in a manner consistent
with the provisions of this Agreement. The parties shall, and shall cause
their independent auditors to, cooperate with the Settlement Auditor and shall
proceed in good faith to cause the Settlement Auditor to resolve such
disagreement within 60 days after such disagreement is submitted to the
Settlement Auditor. The fees and expenses of the Settlement Auditor (i) shall
be paid by Seller if the Buyer's calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital is
closer to the Settlement Auditor's calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital than
the Seller's calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital, (ii) shall be paid by
Buyer if the Seller's calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital is closer to the
<PAGE>
Settlement Auditor's calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital than the Buyer's
calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital and (iii) shall be paid one-half by
Seller and one-half by Buyer if neither the Seller's calculation of Adjusted
Closing Capital nor the Buyer's calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital is
closer to the Settlement Auditor's calculation of Adjusted Closing Capital than
the other.

respective independent auditors in connection with the resolution of any
disagreement submitted to the Settlement Auditor, (ii) the nature and extent of
information that Buyer and Seller may submit to the Settlement Auditor for
consideration in connection with such resolution and (iii) the personnel of the
Settlement Auditor who shall review such information and resolve such
disagreement. The Settlement Auditor's resolution of any such disagreement
shall be reflected in a written report which shall be delivered promptly to,
and shall be final and binding upon, the parties and the Closing Purchase Price
shall be adjusted accordingly to reflect any such resolution and, as adjusted,
shall be deemed to be the Final Purchase Price (subject to Sections 11.1(v) and
11.1(vi)).

(g) Within sixty days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to
Seller its good faith calculation (which shall be made in a manner consistent
with Parent's prior practice) of all liabilities due from the Company or any

pursuant to the tax allocation agreement between Parent, the Company and
certain of the Subsidiaries (the "Tax Allocation Agreement") for the period or
periods beginning on or after November 1, 1993 and ending on or before the
Closing Date, setting forth (with reasonable specificity) the bases for such
calculation. Within twenty days after Seller's receipt thereof, Seller will
provide Buyer with written notice indicating whether Seller agrees or disagrees
with Buyer's calculation of such liabilities. If Seller agrees with Buyer's
calculation of such liabilities or if Seller fails to deliver such written
notice within such twenty day period, the Company will pay to Seller the amount
of Buyer's calculation of such liabilities within five business days of such
written notice of agreement or the expiration of such twenty-day period, and
neither Buyer, Seller, the Company, nor any Subsidiary shall have any further
liability under the Tax Allocation Agreement. If Seller provides written
notice to Buyer of any disagreement with Buyer's calculation of such
liabilities, setting forth (with reasonable specificity) the bases therefor,
Buyer and Seller will begin good faith negotiations to resolve such
disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are able to resolve such disagreement within
ten Business Days after Buyer's receipt of notice of disagreement, Buyer's
calculation of such liabilities will be adjusted accordingly to reflect such
resolution, the Company will pay to Seller the adjusted amount within five
business days after such resolution, and neither Buyer, Seller, the Company,
nor any Subsidiary will have any further liability under the Tax Allocation
Agreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement within
ten Business Days after Buyer's receipt of notice of disagreement, Buyer and
Seller will jointly request the Settlement Auditor to resolve (in accordance
with Sections 2.4(e) and (f) hereof) any issue in dispute as promptly as
possible and will cooperate with the Settlement Auditor to resolve such
dispute. The Settlement Auditor will make a determination with respect to any
disputed issue, and the amount of such liabilities will be as determined by the
Settlement Auditor. Within five Business Days after the Settlement Auditor's
determination, the Company will pay to Seller the amount determined by the
Settlement Auditor, and neither Buyer, Seller, the Company, nor any Subsidiary
<PAGE>
will have any further liability under the Tax Allocation Agreement. Each of
Buyer and Seller will pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the Settlement
Auditor with regard to such determination. No payment pursuant to this Section
2.4(g) will affect Buyer's right to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2
hereof should the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or
otherwise), for the period or periods beginning on or after November 1, 1993
and ending on or before the Closing Date, exceed the amount determined under
this Section 2.4(g).

(h) With respect to the 1991 Reserve referred to in Section
2.4(b)(iii) above, the procedures specified in this Section 2.4 shall be

to each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been timely filed, and all
such Tax Returns are true and complete in all material respects. Each of the
Company and the Subsidiaries (i) has timely paid (or there has been paid on

taxing authority to be due, from or with respect to it for the periods prior to
the date hereof or (ii) has provided for all such material Taxes in its most
recent financial statements referred to in Section 4.9 and in accordance with
GAAP and SAP. With respect to any period for which Tax Returns have not yet
been filed, or for which Taxes are not yet due or owing, the Company or the
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has made due and sufficient current accruals

Subsidiaries and of each affiliated group (within the meaning of the Code) of
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member have not
been audited or examined by any taxing authority, and the statute of
limitations for all periods through the respective years specified in Section
4.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule has expired. No issue relating to the
Company or any Subsidiary has been raised in writing by any taxing authority in
any audit or examination which, by application of the same or similar
principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a material deficiency for
any subsequent period (including periods subsequent to the Closing Date). 
There are no outstanding agreements, waivers or arrangements extending the
statutory period of limitation applicable to any claim for, or the period for
the collection or assessment of, Taxes due from or with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period, and no power of attorney
granted by or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary relating to Taxes
is currently in force. No closing agreement pursuant to section 7121 of the

local, or foreign law has been entered into by or with respect to the Company

United States federal Income Tax Return, and those state, local and foreign
Income Tax Returns showing Taxes due in excess of $5000 for each of the last
three taxable years, filed by each of the Company and the Subsidiaries or

affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any
Subsidiary was then a member. 

(d) No audit or other proceeding by any court, Governmental or
Regulatory Authority, or similar Person is pending or threatened with respect
to any Taxes due from or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

properties.

(or any predecessor provision) has been made or filed by or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or
properties. None of the assets or properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is an asset or property that is or will be required to be treated
as being (i) owned by any Person (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries)
pursuant to the provisions of section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, as amended and in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, or (ii) tax-exempt use property within the meaning of
section 168(h)(1) of the Code.

in violation (or, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would be in
violation) of any applicable law or regulation relating to the payment or
withholding of Taxes the result of which violation has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
<PAGE>
Subsidiaries has duly and timely withheld from employee salaries, wages and
other compensation and paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities all
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over for all periods under all
applicable laws and regulations the violation of which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(g) As of the Closing neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a party to, be bound by or have any obligation under, any
Tax sharing agreement or similar contract or arrangement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries).

(h) Each of the Insurance Subsidiaries is taxable as a life
insurance company within the meaning of section 816 of the Code. The balance
of the policyholders surplus account (as defined in Section 815 of the Code) of
each Insurance Subsidiary is zero.

(i) There is no contract or agreement, plan or arrangement by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries covering any Person that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of section 280G
of the Code.

(j) Seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of
section 1445(b)(2) of the Code.

(k) The insurance reserves with respect to each Insurance Subsidiary
set forth in all federal Income Tax Returns of such Insurance Subsidiary were
determined in all material respects in accordance with Section 807 of the Code.

(l) All life insurance contracts issued by each Insurance Subsidiary
that are subject to Section 7702 of the Code qualify as "life insurance
contracts" within the meaning of Section 7702(a) of the Code. No life
insurance contract issued by any Insurance Subsidiary is a "modified endowment
contract" within the meaning of Section 7702A of the Code. All contracts
issued by each Insurance Subsidiary that are subject to Section 817 of the Code
have met the diversification requirements applicable thereto since the issuance
of the contract. All annuity contracts issued by each Insurance Subsidiary
that are subject to Section 72(s) of the Code contain all of the necessary
provisions of Section 72(s) of the Code.

(m) The Tax treatment under the Code of all insurance, annuity or
investment policies, plans, or contracts, all financial products, employee
benefit plans, individual retirement accounts or annuities, or any similar or
related policy, contract, plan or product, whether individual, group or
otherwise issued or sold by any of the Insurance Subsidiaries is and at all
times has been the same or not less favorable to the purchaser, policyholder,
or beneficiaries thereof than the Tax treatment under the Code for which such
contracts qualified or purported to qualify or which the Insurance Subsidiaries
represented could be obtained at the time of its issuance, purchase,
modification or exchange, except to the extent that the Tax treatment of any
product of any Insurance Subsidiary is not less favorable than the Tax
treatment of substantially similar products offered by other companies. The
provisions of the Code relating to the Tax treatment of such contracts shall
include, but not be limited to, Sections 72, 79, 101, 104, 105, 106, 125, 130,

claims submitted to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for payment in the
ordinary course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and not being

Seller or the Company or any other Subsidiary of Parent (other than the
Subsidiaries of the Company) is a party or by which any of such Persons or
their respective assets or properties are or may be bound by or before any
Federal, state, municipal, foreign or other court or Governmental or Regulatory
Body, or any private tribunal, or, to the Knowledge of Parent and Seller,

Disclosure Schedule, leases set forth in Section 5.9(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, agreements described in Section 5.13, Insurance Contracts

party thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such

moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally, by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). None of

intention to terminate from any other party to any such Contract or Other
Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 4.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure

opinion, provide adequate coverage and limits for the operations, properties
and assets of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be. Neither the
<PAGE>
Company nor any such Subsidiary is in default with respect to any such policy

have a Material Adverse Effect; and (iv) there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened, actions,

Closing Date, (ii) Quarterly SAP Statements of each Insurance Subsidiary for
all interim periods subsequent to March 31, 1994 and prior to the Closing Date

cost of which shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer). Such
GAAP financial statements will present fairly in all material respects the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
its consolidated subsidiaries as of each such date and for each such period in

relates and the statutory results of its operations for the period then ended
and will be prepared in conformity in all material respects with SAP.

7.8 Certain Employee Matters. (a) Employment of Affected
Employees. Any Affected Employee who is actively employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including such employees who are on vacation)
immediately on the Closing Date shall remain an employee of such company
(except that in the case of the employee listed on Section 7.8(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule whom Seller shall cause to become employed by the Company
or one its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date) immediately following
the Closing at the same base compensation and wage levels as in effect
immediately preceding the Closing; provided, however, that the language of this
sentence shall not create any obligation on the part of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any such employee for any
definite period following the Closing. All other employees of the Company or
any Subsidiaries (including such employees who are on temporary layoff,
approved leave of absence, sick-leave, or short- or long-term disability) on
the Closing Date shall remain an employee of Parent, Seller, or one of their
Affiliates, unless otherwise terminated by Parent, Seller or one of their
Affiliates prior to the Closing. Buyer shall cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to offer employment (or severance benefits if such individual's
position is no longer available as allowed by applicable law) to any individual
who was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is receiving
sick-leave or short-term disability benefits under Seller's sick-leave or
short-term disability program or who is on an approved leave of absence as of
the Closing who is entitled to reinstatement under applicable federal or state
law subject to the following conditions (except to the extent that such
conditions are not applicable to the reason for such person's absence): (i)
such individual is released by his or her physician to return to active
employment; (ii) such individual actually returns to active employment
immediately upon such release; and (iii) such release is prior to such
individual's becoming eligible for long-term disability benefits under Seller's
long-term disability program; provided, however, no individual shall be offered
employment under this provision after six months from the Closing or any
applicable period as required by law, if longer. The active participation of
all Affected Employees in each Employee Benefit Program that is not primarily
maintained for the benefit of Affected Employees shall cease as of the Closing
Date. Parent and Seller shall retain any obligations or liabilities with
respect to any benefits or payments, regardless of whether such benefits or
payments were accrued (or relate to claims incurred) prior to or on the Closing
Date, with respect to Affected Employees, unless Buyer has specifically agreed
to cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to assume such obligations or
liabilities under this Section 7.8. For purposes of this Section 7.8, a claim
is deemed incurred when the services that are the subject of the claim are
provided or, in the case of life insurance, when death occurs. 

(b) Substantially Equivalent Benefits. (i) Effective as
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company or one of its Affiliates to
provide such plans, programs, agreements or arrangements on behalf of the
Transferred Employees so as to provide, in the aggregate, employee benefits
which are substantially equivalent to the benefits provided to similarly
situated employees at the life insurance subsidiary of Buyer.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall cause to be
maintained following the Closing Date severance benefits for the Transferred
Employees no less favorable to the Transferred Employees than those provided in
the Book and Enhanced Severance Plans previously provided to Buyer with respect
to any terminations of employment by the Company or one of its Affiliates
occurring within two years after the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries to assume liability for any severance
<PAGE>
payable to Transferred Employees under any severance plan instituted or
maintained by the Company or one of its Affiliates following the Closing Date. 
Except as otherwise provided herein, Parent and Seller shall retain all
obligation and liability for any other severance and continuation benefits,
including SIARP, with respect to the Affected Employees, other than any
Transferred Employees.

(c) Retirement Plan. On or before the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause each Affected Employee who is a participant (other than any
terminated non-vested participant) in the Parent's Retirement Plan to become
fully vested, to the extent not already vested, as of the Closing Date in the
benefits accrued under the Parent's Retirement Plan as of the Closing Date. 
Affected Employees shall cease to accrue any benefits under the Parent's
Retirement Plan as of the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, any new
benefits accrued by Affected Employees shall be accrued under the terms of the
Buyer's Retirement Plan, if any, and Parent's Retirement Plan shall have no
liability or obligation in respect of such accruals.

(d) Defined Contribution Plans. On or before the Closing
Date, Parent and Seller shall cause each Affected Employee who is a participant
(other than any terminated non-vested participant) in the Defined Contribution
Plans to become fully vested, to the extent not already vested, as of the
Closing Date in his account balance under each such plan. The Defined
Contribution Plans shall be amended to provide that contributions thereto in
respect of Affected Employees shall cease as of the Closing Date and any rights
to contributions on or after the Closing Date shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of such plans.

(e) SERP. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Parent and
Seller shall cause each Affected Employee who is a participant in the SERP
immediately prior to the Closing Date to become fully vested, to the extent not
already vested, as of the Closing Date in his accrued benefit under the SERP,
and the Parent and Seller shall retain all obligations and liabilities for
benefits payable to Affected Employees thereunder and shall cause the payment
of such benefits in accordance with the terms thereof.

(f) Post-Retirement Medical Benefits. Parent and Seller
shall retain all obligations and liabilities for post-retirement medical
benefits under the Company Plans in respect of any Affected Employee, whether
such claims are incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date. The Parent or
Seller shall allow those Affected Employees who (A) are employed by the Company
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (B) would on the Closing
Date be immediately eligible to receive post-retirement medical benefits under
any of the Employee Benefit Programs were such employees to retire, and (C) are
notified in writing by Parent or Seller that neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates shall maintain or provide similar coverage after the Closing Date
with respect to Transferred Employees, to elect in writing prior to the Closing
Date to retire and receive medical coverage for such eligible person and his or
her dependents; provided, however, that any such Affected Employee shall not be
treated as a Transferred Employee hereunder and if employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, any medical benefits provided
under the Employee Benefit Programs shall be secondary to the coverage provided
under any such plans maintained for Transferred Employees after the Closing
Date.

(g) Bonuses. Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to assume all obligations and liabilities for bonuses and
<PAGE>
incentive payments in connection with the relevant Employee Benefit Programs in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall cause the payment of
such bonuses or incentive payments, if any, to be made in accordance with the
terms of such Employee Benefit Programs consistent with past practice to the
extent such obligations and liabilities have been accrued on the Closing SAP
Balance Sheet in accordance with SAP, such accruals to be made in a manner
consistent with past practices. 

(h) Vacation. Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to credit each Affected Employee with the number of unused
vacation days credited to such individual through the Closing Date under the
applicable vacation policy of his or her employer and shall permit or cause
Affected Employees to be permitted to use such vacation days.

(i) Welfare Benefits. With respect to each Affected
Employee, Parent and Seller shall retain the obligation and liability for
claims by any such individual (or his or her covered dependent or COBRA
beneficiary) under the Employee Benefit Programs which are employee welfare
benefit plans (within the meaning of section 3(1) of ERISA), whether incurred
prior to, on or after the Closing Date; provided, however, that with respect to
Affected Employees who become Transferred Employees, Parent and Seller shall
only retain the obligation and liability for such claims for such persons (or
dependents or COBRA beneficiaries) to the extent incurred prior to the Closing
Date, regardless of when made. Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide for the waiver under the Company's or one of its
Subsidiaries' welfare benefit plans covering Transferred Employees on and after
the Closing Date of any conditions to coverage with respect to pre-existing
medical conditions and shall credit Transferred Employees with any amounts paid
prior to the Closing Date in order to satisfy applicable deductible amounts and
copayment minimums under the corresponding welfare plans of the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries.

(j) Workers' Compensation. With respect to each Affected
Employee, Parent and Seller shall retain the obligation and liability for any
workers' compensation or similar workers' protection claims with respect to any
such individual, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date which
are the result of an injury or illness originating prior to or on the Closing
Date.

(k) Credit. Buyer, Company and any of its Subsidiaries
shall recognize the service credited to Transferred Employees on or prior to
the Closing Date to the extent recognized under the Employee Benefit Programs
as if such service had been rendered to Buyer or one of its Affiliates in
connection with (i) any welfare benefit plan, (within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA) (other than retiree medical and life insurance and layoff or
severance pay plans or arrangements), for purposes of any waiting period and
eligibility purposes only (including eligibility for benefits that might
otherwise be limited due to pre-existing medical conditions or participant
co-payments and deductibles) and (ii) any employee pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) for purposes of eligibility and vesting only
in which such employees participate and which is made available by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates following the Closing.

(l) Captive Agent Programs. On or after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to retain any obligation or
liability with respect to claims incurred on or before the Closing Date under
the Captive Agent Programs to the extent that such obligations or liabilities
<PAGE>
have been accrued or reserved on the financial statements of Harvest Insurance
Agency, Inc. and any other claims incurred after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall preclude any amendment or termination of any
Captive Agent Program on or after the Closing Date. 

(m) Third-Party Rights. No provision of this Section 7.8
shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Parent, Seller,
any of their Affiliates, the Company or any Subsidiaries of the Company in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) for any specified
period of any nature or kind whatsoever, and no provision of this Section 7.8
shall create such third-party beneficiary rights in any such persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any
employee benefit plan or arrangement, including the currently existing Company
Plans and Benefit Arrangements.

(n) Reimbursement of Liabilities. Within five Business
Days of receipt by the Company of the Closing SAP Financial Statements, Buyer
shall cause the Company or one of its Affiliates to reimburse Parent or Seller
for the lesser of the amount of liabilities accrued on the March 31, 1994
Statutory Balance Sheet or the Closing SAP Balance Sheet that relate to
pension, post-retirement medical, SERP, SIARP, workers compensation and welfare
liabilities which are retained by Parent and Seller in this Section 7.8.

(o) Indemnity. Buyer agrees to indemnify Parent, Seller and
their Affiliates and to defend and hold Parent, Seller and their Affiliates
harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses,
obligations and liabilities (including costs of collection, attorney's fees and
other costs of defense) arising out of any claims by or in respect of any
Transferred Employee (or such Transferred Employee's successors or assigns) or
Captive Agent with respect to any of the obligations or liabilities which Buyer
has agreed to cause the Company or its Affiliates to assume hereunder or any
other events arising after the Closing Date, including claims with respect to
(i) assumed severance, (ii) vacation, (iii) bonus or incentive payments, (iv)
WARN or any similar state notification law or (v) the Captive Agent Programs. 
Seller and Parent hereby agree to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and to
defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all
Losses arising out of (x) any claims by or in respect of any Affected Employee
(or such Affected Employee's successors and assigns) under any of the Employee
Benefit Programs with respect to any of the obligations or liabilities which
Buyer has not agreed to cause the Company or its Affiliates to assume
hereunder, (y) any "employee pension plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA) or any "group health plan" (within the meaning of Section 607 of
ERISA) in respect of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have any
liability solely as a result of being a member of a "controlled group" (within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) prior to the Closing Date which
includes Parent or Seller (but exclusive of liabilities in connection with
Affected Employees under any such plan maintained or contributed to by the
Company of any of its Subsidiaries) and (z) any claims by or in respect of any
Captive Agents Program with respect to events occurring prior to the Closing
Date or Captive Agents to the extent that any such claims, regardless of
whether such claims were incurred on or before the Closing Date, exceed the
amount reserved for such claims on the most recent financial statements of The
Harvest Life Insurance Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the indemnities provided for herein shall not be
subject to any minimum or maximum amount of liability or other basket or
monetary limitation, and all such indemnities shall survive until 60 days after
<PAGE>
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect thereto. 
Any claim for indemnification by Buyer, Seller or Parent pursuant to this
Section 7.8(o) shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Section 10.5.

7.9 Settlement of Intercompany Accounts; Cancellation of
Intercompany and Other Agreements. Subject to Section 2.4(g), the parties
agree that all intercompany accounts, including all accounts receivable
(whether or not currently due and payable), between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Seller and their Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be settled in
full on or prior to the Closing Date (subject to the next sentence). Within
five days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer a schedule of
all amounts to be so settled on the Closing Date. If Buyer agrees with such
settlement amounts, Seller will, at Closing, cause such amounts to be settled. 
If Buyer disagrees with any such settlements, Buyer and Seller will resolve
such disagreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
2.4(g), and such settlement payments will be made after such resolution. 
Except for the lease and any related agreement entered into pursuant to Section
7.10, any agreements entered into in connection with Section 7.8 and as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, Company shall cause any Contracts or
Other Agreements between the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, to be cancelled. Except in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Seller and their Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall not enter into
any material Contracts or Other Arrangements with each other or engage in any
material transactions with each other without the consent of Buyer, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

7.10 Headquarters Facility. Prior to or contemporaneously
with the Closing, Seller and the Company shall enter into a lease, effective as
of the Closing Date, to provide the Company and its Subsidiaries with the use
for a period of not less than 12 months of not less than 75% of the space
presently used for the Company's insurance operations in the premises in
Orlando, Florida leased by Seller and such building services agreed upon by the
parties at such facility at an aggregate cost equal to market rates for
comparable facilities in the area. All costs and expenses of reconfiguring
such facilities to segregate the space occupied by the Company and its
Subsidiaries from that occupied by the remaining operations of Seller and its
Affiliates in such facility (which reconfiguration shall be determined at the
reasonable discretion of Seller) shall be borne by Seller.

7.11 Name Change. Immediately following the Closing, Buyer
shall cause the Company to file an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation to change the Company's name to a name that does not include
"Harcourt." Buyer and its Affiliates shall not use "Harcourt" or any name or
term confusingly similar to "Harcourt" in any corporate name or in connection
with the operation of any business; provided, however, that Buyer shall have a
period of up to 180 days to use existing stocks of stationery and forms bearing
the name "Harcourt" and shall be permitted otherwise to use the name "Harcourt"
during such 180 day period, but only to the extent necessary to avoid financial
hardship in the course of the transition from the use of the name "Harcourt." 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cease using the name
"Harcourt" as soon as practicable following the Closing. This Section 7.11
shall not be construed to prohibit the Buyer from using the name "Harcourt" in
<PAGE>
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns required by the IRS or state tax
authorities or the filing of any other documents required by any Governmental
or Regulatory Body.

7.12 Investments. Parent and Seller will cause each of the
Insurance Subsidiaries to invest its future cash flow, any cash from matured
and maturing investments, any cash proceeds from the sale of Assets, and any
cash funds currently held by such entity exclusively in the type of assets
described on, Section 7.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, except as
otherwise required by law or except as required to provide cash (in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice) to meet such
entity's reasonably anticipated current obligations. Parent and Seller will
cause the Company and the Insurance Subsidiaries to take such actions as are
necessary to ensure that the assets of each Insurance Subsidiary that are
classified as nonadmitted under SAP or by the applicable insurance regulatory
authorities for such Insurance Subsidiary do not at any time exceed by a
material amount the respective amounts of nonadmitted assets for such Insurance
Subsidiary as of December 31, 1993. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Seller will cause the Insurance Subsidiaries to refrain from selling or
otherwise disposing of any portfolio asset which will result in the
realization, from March 31, 1994 through the Closing Date, of pre-Tax net
capital gains or net capital losses in excess of an aggregate of (a) $(10)
million in the case of net losses and (b) $10 million in the case of net gains
except as provided below. Parent and Seller will cause each of the Insurance
Subsidiaries to restructure their invested assets so that through the Closing
Date, the option adjusted duration (as hereinafter defined) of the invested
assets of the Insurance Subsidiaries of the Company taken as a whole does not
differ from the option adjusted duration of the insurance liabilities of the
Insurance Subsidiaries of the Company taken as a whole by more than 182 days. 
Such restructuring will be completed within 30 days of receipt by the Company
of the option adjusted duration calculations. Within five days after the date
hereof, Seller will retain a nationally recognized actuarial consulting or
investment banking firm (the "Third Party Consultant"), subject to Buyer's
approval, to calculate the option adjusted duration of the insurance
liabilities and the invested assets and recalculate the option adjusted
duration of the invested assets each 30 days thereafter, all such calculations
to be delivered to the Company, Buyer and Seller. If such restructuring would
result in net capital gains in excess of $10 million or net capital losses in
excess of $(10) million, in each case from March 31, 1994 through the Closing
Date, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer and Buyer must elect to adjust the
duration matching requirement and/or allow such transactions as necessary to
allow the duration matching requirement to be met. Option adjusted duration
shall measure the sensitivity of the value of the invested assets and insurance
liabilities to changes in interest rates taking into account the financial
options embedded in each of the insurance liabilities and the invested assets. 
The specific definition and calculation of option adjusted duration shall be
agreed upon by Buyer, Seller and the Third Party Consultant.

7.13 Resignations of Directors. Parent and Seller will cause
such members of the boards of directors and such officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as are designated by Buyer to tender, effective at the
Closing, their resignations from such boards of directors or from such offices.

7.14 No Negotiations, etc. Parent and Seller will refrain and
will cause each other Person acting for or on behalf of them to refrain from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action (i) to seek or encourage any offer
(including in connection with any proposed public offering of securities) or
<PAGE>
proposal from any Person to acquire any assets or shares of capital stock or
other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any interests
therein, (ii) to merge, consolidate, or combine, or to permit any other Person
to merge, consolidate or combine, with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) to liquidate, dissolve, or reorganize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iv) to acquire or transfer any assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any interests therein, except in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice or except as expressly permitted by
the terms of this Agreement, (v) to reach any agreement or understanding
(whether or not such agreement or understanding is absolute, revocable,
contingent, or conditional) for, or otherwise to attempt to consummate, any
such acquisition, transfer, merger, consolidation, combination, or
reorganization, or (vi) to furnish or cause to be furnished any information
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other
than Buyer) that Parent or Seller (or any Person acting for or on behalf of
them) knows or has reason to believe is in the process of attempting or
considering any such acquisition, transfer, merger, consolidation, combination,
liquidation, dissolution or reorganization. If Parent or Seller receives from
any Person (other than Buyer) any offer, proposal, or informational request
that is subject to this Section 7.14, Parent or Seller will promptly advise
such Person, by written notice, of the terms of this Section 7.14 and will
promptly deliver a copy of such notice to Buyer.

7.15 Real Estate. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, Seller (or its designee) will acquire any and all real property owned by
the Company or its Subsidiaries that Buyer requests, in its sole discretion,
Seller to acquire without any corresponding adjustment in the Final Purchase
Price.

warranties contained in Sections 4.10(l) and 4.10(m), such representations and
warranties shall survive until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, (iv)
in the case of all other representations and warranties, such representations
and warranties shall expire on February 28, 1996, except that in the case of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10, insofar as such
representations and warranties relate to Income Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary or to Employment and Withholding Taxes, such representations and
warranties shall not survive the Closing, it being the intention of the parties
that Buyer's rights against Seller with respect to such Income Taxes and
Employment and Withholding Taxes shall be governed solely by Section 11.2, and
(v) provided, that any representation or warranty shall survive the time it
would otherwise terminate pursuant to this Section 10.1 to the extent that
notice of a breach thereof giving rise to a right of indemnification shall have
been given by a party hereto in accordance with this Article 10 prior to such
time.

10.2 Indemnification by Parent and Seller. From and after the
Closing, subject to the provisions of Section 10.1 (which shall govern the
period during which each of the following indemnities shall remain in effect,
except as otherwise specified below), Parent and Seller jointly and severally
shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by Buyer, the Company and their respective Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
arising out of, resulting from, or relating to (a) any breach of any of the
representations or warranties made by Parent, Seller or the Company in this
Agreement, (b) any failure by Parent, Seller or the Company to perform any of
its respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (c) any
denial by any of the Insurance Subsidiaries of mandated health benefits under a
health insurance policy underwritten by such Insurance Subsidiary and (d) the
employment or termination of employment, including a constructive termination,
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any individual (including, but not
limited to, any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
attributable to any actions or inactions occurring prior to the Closing Date,
with respect to which a claim, complaint or proceeding is filed or instituted,
within one year (or with respect to claims, complaints or proceedings involving
sexual harrassment, five years) after the Closing Date, with any court or
applicable administrative agency; provided that Parent and Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all
Losses in accordance with the foregoing until the aggregate amount thereof
exceeds $5,000,000, at which time Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification as
set forth above, including with respect to the first $5,000,000 of such Losses;
and the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of which Buyer shall be entitled
to indemnification in accordance with this Section 10.2 shall not exceed
$250,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the indemnity relating to a
breach of the representation and warranty contained in Section 4.5 shall not be
<PAGE>
subject to any minimum or maximum amount of liability or other basket or
monetary limitation, and (ii) this Article 10 shall not apply to the matters
governed by Section 7.8(o) (other than the procedural provisions of Section
10.5) or Article 11.

10.3 Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Parent from and against any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by Parent, Seller and their respective
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives arising out of, resulting from, or relating to (a) subject to
Section 10.1, any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by
Buyer in this Agreement; and (b) any failure by Buyer to perform any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

10.4 Environmental Indemnification. Parent and Seller hereby
agree to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless against any and all Losses arising
out of or resulting from any Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing
Date, to the extent such Losses result from conditions existing as of or prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the indemnities provided for in this Section 10.4 shall not be
subject to any minimum amount of liability or other basket or monetary
limitation, and all such indemnities shall survive until 60 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect thereto.

10.5 Procedure. (a) In the event that any Person shall incur
or suffer any Losses in respect of which indemnification may be sought
hereunder by Buyer, Seller or Parent, the party seeking to be indemnified
hereunder (the "Indemnitee") shall assert a claim for indemnification by
written notice (the "Notice") to the party from whom indemnification is being
sought (the "Indemnitor") stating the nature and basis of such claim. In the
case of Losses arising or which may arise by reason of any third party claim,
promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of written notice of the assertion or
the commencement of any Litigation with respect to any matter in respect of
which indemnification may be sought by such party hereunder, the Indemnitee
shall give Notice to the Indemnitor and shall thereafter keep the Indemnitor
reasonably informed with respect thereto, provided that failure of the
Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor prompt notice as provided herein shall not
relieve the Indemnitor of any of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure. In case
any such Litigation is brought against any Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof, by written notice of its intention to
do so to the Indemnitee within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, in which
event the Indemnitor shall assume all future responsibility for such
Litigation. If the Indemnitor shall assume the defense of such Litigation, it
shall not settle such Litigation unless such settlement includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff of a
release of the Indemnitee from all liability with respect to such Litigation. 
As long as the Indemnitor is contesting any such Litigation in good faith and
on a timely basis, the Indemnitee shall not pay or settle any claims brought
under such Litigation. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Indemnitor of the
defense of any Litigation as provided in this Section 10.5(a), the Indemnitee
shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such Litigation and to
employ counsel at its own expense; provided, however, that if the defendants in
any action shall include both an Indemnitor and any Indemnitee and such
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that counsel selected by Indemnitor
has a conflict of interest because of the availability of different or
additional defenses to such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall have the right to
<PAGE>
select separate counsel to participate in the defense of such action on its
behalf, at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided that the Indemnitor shall
not be obligated to pay the expenses of more than one separate counsel for all
Indemnitees.

(b) If the Indemnitor shall fail to notify the Indemnitee of
its desire to assume the defense of any such Litigation within the prescribed
period of time and as required above, or shall notify the Indemnitee that it
will not assume the defense of any such Litigation, then the Indemnitee may
assume the defense of any such Litigation, in which event it may do so in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, and the Indemnitor shall be bound by any
determination made in such Litigation or any settlement thereof effected by the
Indemnitee, provided that any such determination or settlement shall not affect
the right of the Indemnitor to dispute the Indemnitee's claim for
indemnification and provided that the Indemnitee shall not effect any such
settlement without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld). The failure of the Indemnitor to assume the
defense of any such Litigation shall not be deemed a concession that it is
required to indemnify the Indemnitee for the subject matter of such Litigation. 
The Indemnitor shall be permitted to join in the defense of such Litigation and
to employ counsel at its own expense.

(c) Any payment by any Indemnitor in indemnification hereunder
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

11. Tax Matters.

11.1 Certain Tax Matters. (i) With respect to Seller's sale
of the Shares hereunder, Seller and Buyer shall jointly make timely and
irrevocable elections under section 338(h)(10) of the Code (which elections
shall be made with respect to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries), and,
if permissible, similar elections under any applicable state or local income
tax laws. Buyer and Seller agree to report the transfer under this Agreement
consistent with such elections under section 338(h)(10) of the Code or any
similar state or local tax provision (the "Elections") and agree not to take
any action that could cause such Elections to be invalid, and shall take no
position contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a determination
(as defined in section 1313(a) of the Code) or any similar state or local tax
provision.

(ii) To the extent possible, Buyer, Parent, Seller and the
Company agree to execute at the Closing any and all forms necessary to
effectuate the Elections (including, without limitation, Internal Revenue
Service Form 8023 and any similar forms under applicable state and local income
tax laws (the "Section 338 Forms")). In the event, however, any Section 338
Forms are not executed at the Closing, Buyer, Parent, Seller and the Company
agree to prepare and complete each such Section 338 Form no later than 15 days
prior to the date such Section 338 Form is required to be filed. Buyer,
Parent, Seller and the Company shall each cause the Section 338 Forms to be
duly executed by an authorized person for Buyer, Parent, Seller or the Company,
in each case, and shall duly and timely file the Section 338 Forms in
accordance with applicable tax laws and the terms of this Agreement.

(iii) Buyer shall reasonably determine the fair market value
of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries and the allocation of the
Deemed Sale Price (as defined below) among such assets (the "Allocation"). 
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth the Allocation as soon
<PAGE>
as practicable after the Closing Date (the "Allocation Schedule"). If the
Allocation could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Seller, then Seller shall be entitled to have Seller's reasonable comments
incorporated into the Allocation Schedule. Seller, Buyer, the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall file all Tax Returns consistently with the Allocation
Schedule. 

(iv) Within sixty days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide to Seller schedules setting forth Buyer's determination of (A) the
aggregate bases of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date (determined without giving effect to the Elections) (the
"Aggregate Asset Bases") and (B) the deemed sale price of the assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries resulting from the Elections pursuant to Treas.
Reg. Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(f) (the "Deemed Sale Price") (the "Schedules"). 
Buyer shall permit Seller to review the books and records of the Company and
the Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably necessary for Seller to review the
Schedules. Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of any objections to Buyer's
computation of the Aggregate Asset Bases and the Deemed Sale Price within
twenty days of receipt of the Schedules. If Seller fails to object in writing
to the Schedules within twenty days of receipt, the Schedules shall be deemed
to be final. If Seller makes a timely written objection to the Schedules, then
Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any matters in
dispute. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve all matters in dispute with
respect to the Schedules within thirty days of the receipt by Buyer of Seller's
written objection, then Seller and Buyer shall submit any remaining disputed
matters to the Settlement Auditor for resolution. Seller and Buyer will
cooperate with the Settlement Auditor to resolve the remaining disputed items. 
Seller and Buyer will each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Settlement Auditor. The Settlement Auditor's resolution of any such disputed
items will be reflected in a written report which will be delivered promptly
to, and will be final and binding upon, Seller and Buyer.

(v) Within ten days after the Aggregate Asset Bases and
the Deemed Sale Price have been finally determined, Seller shall pay to Buyer
as an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price the Basis Step-Up Deficit or
Buyer shall pay to Seller as an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price the
Basis Step-Up Excess, as the case may be. The term "Basis Step-Up Deficit"
shall mean the product of (i) $2 million times (ii) the ratio of (X) $70
million minus the Bases Step-Up (provided that (X) shall not be less than zero)
to (Y) $10 million. The term "Basis Step-Up Excess" shall mean the product of
(i) $2 million times (ii) the ratio of (X) the Basis Step-Up minus $70 million
(provided that (X) shall not be less than zero) to (Y) $10 million. The "Basis
Step-Up" shall mean the Deemed Sale Price (computed without regard to any
payment of the Basis Step-Up Deficit or the Basis Step-Up Excess under this
Section 11.1(v) minus the Aggregate Asset Bases.

(vi) In the event that following the Closing Date there is
an adjustment for federal Income Tax purposes by a taxing authority and the
effect of such adjustment is that the Aggregate Asset Bases, the Deemed Sale
Price, the Basis Step-Up Deficit or the Basis Step-Up Excess (including,
without limitation, by reason of the invalidity of the Elections) is changed,
then upon the final resolution of such adjustment Buyer shall recompute the
Basis Step-Up Deficit or the Basis Step-Up Excess, as the case may be. Buyer
shall give Seller notice of such recomputed Basis Step-Up Deficit or Basis
Step-Up Excess. Within ten days thereafter, Seller shall pay Buyer the excess
of the recomputed Basis Step-Up Deficit over the Basis Step-Up Deficit as
originally computed or the excess of the Basis Step-Up Excess as originally
<PAGE>
computed over the recomputed Basis Step-Up Excess or Buyer shall pay Seller the
excess of the recomputed Basis Step-Up Excess over the Basis Step-Up Excess as
originally computed or the excess of the Basis Step-Up Deficit as originally
computed over the Basis Step-Up Deficit as recomputed, as the case may be.

11.2 Tax Indemnification. (a) Parent and Seller jointly and
severally shall be responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) from and against any and all Losses
for or in respect of each of the following:

(i) any and all Income Taxes with respect to any taxable
period of the Company or any Subsidiary (or any predecessor) ending on
or before the Closing Date (including Income Taxes arising as a result
of the Elections);

(ii) any and all Income Taxes resulting from the Company or
any Subsidiary having been (or ceasing to be) included in any
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that included
the Company or any Subsidiary (or any predecessor) for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date
(including without limitation any liability for Taxes resulting from a
"deferred intercompany transaction", within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-13(a)(2) (or any analogous or similar
provision under state, local or foreign law), that occurred on or
before the Closing Date);

(iii) any and all Income Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group (other than the
Company or any Subsidiary) of which the Company or any Subsidiary (or
any predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, by
reason of the liability of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or any analogous or similar
state, local or foreign law or regulation;

(iv) any and all Employment and Withholding Taxes; and

(v) any and all Income Taxes allocated to the Seller
pursuant to Section 11.2(c) hereof and not previously paid thereunder.

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates from and against (and Seller and its Affiliates shall have no
liability under Section 11.2(a) on account of) any and all Losses for or in
respect of any and all Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor) that are not described in Section 11.2(a) except for such Taxes
arising from a breach of a representation or warranty contained in 4.10, to the
extent such representation or warranty has not expired pursuant to Section
10.1. 

(c) Seller and Buyer shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, elect with the relevant taxing authority to close the taxable
period of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. In any case
where applicable law does not permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to close its taxable year on the Closing Date, then Income Taxes
attributable to the taxable period of the Company or such Subsidiary beginning
on or before and ending after the Closing Date shall be allocated (i) to Seller
for the period up to and including the Closing Date and (ii) to Buyer for the
<PAGE>
period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation required to determine
any Income Taxes attributable to any period beginning on or before and ending
after the Closing Date (including without limitation any Taxes resulting from a
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding) shall be made by means of a
closing of the books and records of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the close of business on the Closing Date and, to the extent not susceptible
to such allocation, by apportionment on the basis of elapsed days.

(d) (i) Promptly after receipt by Buyer or its Affiliates of
written notice of the assertion or commencement of any claim, audit,
examination, or other proposed change or adjustment by any taxing authority
concerning any Tax covered by Section 11.2(a) (each a "Tax Claim"), Buyer shall
notify Seller. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent
known by Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) describing the asserted
Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
Claim. The failure of Buyer to give Seller prompt notice as provided herein
shall not relieve Seller of any of its obligations under Section 11.2, except
to the extent that the Seller is materially prejudiced by such failure. 

(ii) Seller shall have the sole right to represent the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax covered by Section
11.2(a) and to employ counsel of its choice; provided that if the results of
such Tax audit or proceeding (other than a Tax audit or proceeding with respect
to any Seller Consolidated and Combined Return, as to which Seller's sole
obligation will be to keep Buyer duly informed of the progress thereof) could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business or
condition of Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or their Affiliates for any
taxable period including or ending after the Closing Date, then Seller and
Buyer shall jointly control the defense and settlement of any such Tax audit or
proceeding and each party shall cooperate with the other party at its own
expense and there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with
respect thereto without the consent of the other party, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if it decides not
to control the defense or settlement of any such Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding and Buyer thereupon shall be permitted to defend and settle
such Tax audit or proceeding.

(iii) With respect to any taxable period of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries beginning before and ending after the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall jointly control the defense and settlement of any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax covered by
Section 11.2 (a) and each party shall cooperate with the other party at its own
expense and there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with
respect thereto without the consent of the other party, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that if either party shall refuse
to consent to any settlement, closing or other agreement that the other party
proposed to accept (a "Proposed Settlement"), then (1) the liability with
respect to the subject matter of the Proposed Settlement of the party who
proposed to accept the Proposed Settlement shall be limited to the amount that
such liability would have been if the Proposed Settlement had been accepted and
(2) the other party shall be responsible for all expenses incurred thereafter
in connection with the contest of such Tax audit or proceeding except to the
extent that the final settlement imposes less liability on the party who
proposed to accept the Proposed Settlement than the Proposed Settlement would
have imposed.
<PAGE>
(iv) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the commencement
of any claim, audit, examination or other proposed change or adjustment by any
taxing authority which could reasonably be expected to affect the liability of
the Company or any Subsidiary for Taxes and Seller shall keep Buyer duly
informed of the progress thereof.

(e) (i) Seller shall properly prepare or cause to be properly
prepared, and shall timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Income Tax
Returns which include the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their assets or
operations for all taxable periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending
on or before the Closing Date (which Tax Returns shall include the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the reportable items from the assets or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries through and including the Closing Date). Such Tax
Returns (insofar as they relate to the Company or any Subsidiary) shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practices, and the Company and the
Subsidiaries shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns or otherwise levied or assessed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or
any of its Assets on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
provided to Buyer for Buyer's review and comment 30 days prior to filing, and
Buyer shall be entitled to suggest to Seller any reasonable changes to such Tax
Returns. Seller and Buyer agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issue
arising as a result of the review of such Tax Returns and mutually to consent
to the filing as promptly as possible of such Tax Returns. In the event the
parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten days following the
delivery of such Tax Returns, the parties shall jointly request the Settlement
Auditor to resolve any issue at least five days before the due date of any such
Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. Seller and
Buyer shall each pay one-half of the Settlement Auditor's fees and expenses. 
Seller shall, subsequent to the Closing Date, provide written notice to Buyer
of the filing of any amended Tax Return or claim for refund with respect to any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and if any such filing
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business
or condition of Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary, or their Affiliates for any
taxable period including or ending after the Closing Date, Seller will not make
such filing without the consent of Buyer, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld.

(ii) Except as set forth in clause (iii) below, Buyer shall
be responsible for filing all other Tax Returns required to be filed after the
Closing Date by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or with
respect to their assets and operations.

(iii) With respect to any Income Tax Return required to be
filed by Buyer for a taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall deliver, at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return (including extensions), to Seller a statement setting forth the amount
of Tax allocated to Seller pursuant to Section 11.2(c) (the "Tax Statement")
and copies of such Tax Returns, and Buyer shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. Seller shall
have the right to review such Tax Return and the Tax Statement prior to the
filing of such Tax Return and to suggest to Buyer any reasonable changes to
such Tax Returns. Seller and Buyer agree to consult and resolve in good faith
any issue arising as a result of the review of such Tax Return and the Tax
Statement and mutually to consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such
Tax Return. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within
ten days following the delivery of such Tax Return and the Tax Statement, the
<PAGE>
parties shall jointly request the Settlement Auditor to resolve any issue in
dispute as promptly as possible. If the Settlement Auditor is unable to make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue within five Business Days
prior to the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the Tax Return
in question, then Buyer may file such Tax Return on the due date (including
extensions) therefor without such determination having been made and without
Seller's consent. Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax Return, the
Settlement Auditor shall make a determination with respect to any disputed
issue, and the amount of Taxes that are allocated to Seller pursuant to
Section 11.2(c) shall be as determined by the Settlement Auditor. The fees and
expenses of the Settlement Auditor shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half
by Seller. Nothing in this Section 11.2(e)(iii) shall excuse Seller from its
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 11.2 hereof if the amount of
Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise), for the periods covered
by such Tax Returns and which are allocable to Seller pursuant to Section
11.2(c), exceeds the amount determined under this Section 11.2(e)(iii).

(iv) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate fully with each other
and make available to each other in a timely fashion such Tax data and other
information as may be reasonably required by Seller or Buyer for the
preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns required to be prepared and
filed by Seller or Buyer hereunder, or in connection with the preparation or
filing of any election, claim for refund, consent or certification.

(f) Seller and Buyer shall provide to each other, and
Buyer shall cause each of the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide to
Seller, full access, at any reasonable time and from time to time, at the
business location at which the books and records are maintained, after the
Closing Date, to such Tax data of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, may from time to time reasonably request
and will furnish, and request the independent accountants and legal counsel of
Seller, Buyer, the Company, or any Subsidiary of the Company to furnish to
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, such additional Tax and other information
and documents in the possession of such persons as Seller or Buyer may from
time to time reasonably request.

(g) Any claim for indemnity hereunder may be made at any
time prior to 60 days after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of
limitations with respect to the relevant taxable period (including all periods
of extension, whether automatic or permissive). 

(h) The party seeking indemnification or other payment
pursuant to this Section 11.2 (Seller or Buyer, as the case may be) shall give
the other party written notice of claim for indemnification or payment, which
notice shall include a calculation of the amount of the requested indemnity or
other payment and shall furnish to the other party copies of all books, records
and other information reasonably requested by the other party to the extent
necessary to substantiate such claim and verify the amount thereof. If
reasonably necessary in order to make or substantiate a claim (or to determine
if a claim should be made), each party shall be permitted access to the other
party's books, records and other information in connection therewith. The
party requested to make any indemnity or other payment pursuant to this Section
11.2 shall deliver to the party requesting payment, within 30 days after
receiving both the foregoing notice and all books, records and other
information reasonably requested by it, a detailed statement describing its
objections (if any) thereto. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to
resolve any such objections, but if they do not obtain a final resolution
<PAGE>
within 30 days (or any longer period mutually agreed to by the parties) after
the party requesting indemnification (or other payment) has received the
statement of objections, the Settlement Auditor shall resolve any remaining
objections. Seller and Buyer shall each pay one-half of the Settlement
Auditor's fees and expenses.

(i) Seller shall be responsible for, shall pay or cause to
be paid, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, as an adjustment to the
Final Purchase Price, from and against any Losses arising after the Closing
Date arising under any Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or similar
contracts (whether or not written) to which the Company or any Subsidiary, any
predecessor of the Company or any Subsidiary, or any transferor to the Company
or any Subsidiary, is a party or is obligated thereunder, in each case on or
prior to the Closing Date. Neither Seller, Buyer, the Company nor any
Subsidiary shall have any liability pursuant to the Tax Allocation Agreement
after the Closing Date except as specifically contemplated under this
Agreement.

11.3 Tax Related Adjustments. (a) Seller and Buyer agree
that any indemnity payment made hereunder will be treated by the parties on
their Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price. If,
notwithstanding such treatment by the parties, any indemnity payment is
determined to be taxable to Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary for federal
Income Tax purposes by any taxing authority, the Seller shall indemnify the
Buyer for any Taxes payable by the Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary by
reason of the receipt of such indemnity payment (including any payments under
this Section 11.3), determined at a Tax rate equal to 37%.

(b) An indemnity payment otherwise due and payable
hereunder shall be decreased (but not below zero) to the extent of any net
actual reduction in federal Income Tax liability that is actually realized by
the indemnitee upon its payment of an indemnifiable loss, determined at a Tax
rate equal to 37%.

(c) Except as provided in Section 11.3(d), Buyer shall pay
to Seller any refund of any Tax covered by Section 11.2(a) or the amount of
actual reduction in such Taxes realized (or portion of either thereof) after
the Closing Date by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) relating to such Taxes imposed on or with respect to
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on
or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall pay to Seller such refund (including
interest received thereon) (reduced by any actual Tax increase or actual Tax
detriment to Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary, but increased by any actual
Tax benefit resulting from such payment) or the amount of any such reduction in
Taxes promptly upon receipt thereof by the recipient thereof. Buyer shall, if
Seller requests, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds
or equivalent amounts to which Seller is entitled under this Section 11.3(c),
and Buyer shall permit Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund
claim, and shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate powers
of attorney such Persons as Seller shall designate to represent such entity
with respect to such refund claim; provided, however, that Buyer must consent
to any such refund claim, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, and
that any such refund claim shall be at the sole expense of the Seller.

(d) Seller agrees that to the extent that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries realizes any Tax attribute after the Closing Date that
<PAGE>
may be carried back to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall, at Buyer's sole expense, permit such carryback, shall cooperate
in the filing of any required returns or claims for refund and shall pay Buyer
any Tax refund received or the amount of any reduction in Taxes so obtained by
the Seller Group (as hereinafter defined); provided, however, in the event that
any Tax attribute generated after the Closing Date by Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Subsidiaries or any member of any affiliated
group (or other group filing on a combined basis) of which any thereof is a
member (any of the foregoing being referred to herein as a "Buyer Group
Member") is carried back to a taxable year (or portion thereof) of Parent's
affiliated group (or other group filing on a combined basis of which Seller is
a member) (the "Seller Group") that ended on or prior to the Closing Date and,
as a result of such carryback by such Buyer Group Member, any Tax attribute
generated by the Seller Group (whether in the same year or in a subsequent
year) is not capable of being carried back to the same extent it would have

CHESTNUT HILL, MA and STAMFORD, CT, June 30, 1994 --

Harcourt General, Inc. (NYSE:H) and GE Capital today announced an

agreement for the sale of Harcourt General Insurance Companies to

GE Capital Corporation for $400 million in cash.

Under the agreement, GE Capital would acquire all of the

insurance businesses of Harcourt General Insurance Companies,

including Federal Home Life Insurance Company, PHF Life Insurance

Company, and The Harvest Life Insurance Company. Together, these

companies have approximately $3 billion in assets and had

revenues in the fiscal year ended October 31, 1993 of

approximately $550 million. The businesses would operate as part

of GE Capital's GNA unit based in Seattle, Washington.

The transaction, subject to approval by various state

regulatory agencies, is expected to close by calendar year-end.

Robert J. Tarr, Jr., president and chief executive officer

of Harcourt General said, "We're pleased to reach this agreement,

which will allow Harcourt General to further focus on its core

publishing and speciality retailing businesses. The cash

proceeds, which will total approximately $375 million after

taxes, will raise our cash balances to about $800 million. We

continue to look for acquisition opportunities to enhance the

Company's growth prospects and build shareholder value."

Patrick R. Welch, GNA's president and chief executive

officer, said "We are excited about this acquisition for a number

of reasons. This is a well-run company with a good tract record

which will add product breadth and distribution capability to our

existing portfolio of services. We will continue to expand its

distribution network and develop its value-added products."

Harcourt General's insurance businesses, which were acquired

in November 1991 as part of the Company's merger with Harcourt

Brace Jovanovich, Inc., underwrite individual life, health,

accident and credit insurance policies and also sell annuity

products.

Harcourt General said that the insurance business will be

treated as a discontinued operation in the Company's third fiscal

quarter ending July 31, 1994. In the fiscal year ended October

31, 1993, insurance accounted for approximately 15% of Harcourt

General's $3.7 billion in revenues and nearly 20% of its $361.6

million of operating earnings before corporate expenses. In

fiscal 1993, insurance operating earnings benefitted from $27.8

million of capital gains.

Robert J. Tarr, Jr., president and chief executive officer,

reported that upon completion of the transaction, the Company

expects to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $12 million, or

about 10 cents per share after taxes.

Company, is a diversified financial services company

headquartered in Stamford, CT. GE Capital's activities include

financing, speciality insurance and consumer services. GE is a
