September 30, 1994

O'Sullivan Corporation
1944 Valley Avenue
P.O. Box 3510
Winchester, VA 22601
Attention: Arthur H. Bryant, II

Gentlemen:

This letter sets forth an agreement in principle on which 
Automotive Industries, Inc. or one or more new subsidiary 
corporations ("AII") proposes to acquire certain assets of the 
Gulfstream Division (the "Business") from O'Sullivan Corporation 
("OS").

1. Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities. AII will (a) 
purchase all of the Seller's property, equipment, inventory, 
plants (other than the Gulfstream Main Facility and certain 
equipment), and certain intangible assets, each with respect to 
the Business, and all of the capital stock of Capitol Plastics of 
Ohio, Inc. ("Capitol") (collectively, the "Purchased Assets") and 
(b) assume certain of the Business' trade accounts payable and 
accrued expenses as of the closing, determined in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied 
("GAAP"), and certain of the Business' ordinary course of 
business contractual obligations to be performed after the 
closing, each to the extent specified on a schedule to the 
definitive purchase agreement.

2. Consideration. The aggregate consideration for the 
Purchased Assets will be an amount equal to the sum of (a) $41.0 
million plus (b) the book value of the acquired inventory plus 
(c) the amount of capital expenditures less the greater of the 
book value of, or the proceeds received from, capital sales, 
retirements or other dispositions made since June 30, 1994 less 
(d) the book value of all assumed liabilities (other than 
Capitol's liabilities) less (e) the excess, if any, of the net 
book value of Capitol's liabilities over Capitol's assets other 
than property, plant and equipment and inventory, each determined 
as of the date of closing in accordance with GAAP, payable in 
immediately available funds at the closing.

3. Expenses. AII and OS will each pay their respective 
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel, 
investment bankers, brokers or other representatives or 
consultants) in connection with the transactions contemplated 
hereby (whether consummated or not); provided, however, if, 
within four months after the date hereof, OS enters into any 
contract, commitment, arrangement, understanding, or reaches an 
agreement or understanding in principle, or OS' Board of 
Directors approves any transaction with respect to the sale or 
other disposition of the Purchased Assets to any party other than 
AII for which the consideration to be received therefrom exceeds 
the aggregate consideration set forth in Section 2 above and AII 
has not prior thereto elected to terminate discussions with OS
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, then OS 
will reimburse AII in an amount not in excess of $750,000 for all 
fees and expenses incurred by AII or AII's employees, officers, 
affiliates, advisors or agents in connection with the proposed 
transaction contemplated hereby.

4. Exclusivity. Prior to October 31, 1994, OS will not, 
and will cause its officers, directors, agents and affiliates to 
not, discuss a possible sale or other disposition of all or any 
part of the assets of the Business, other than inventory in the 
ordinary course of business (whether by merger, reorganization, 
recapitalization, liquidation or otherwise) with any other party 
(an "Acquisition Proposal") or provide any information to any 
other party regarding the Business other than information which 
is traditionally provided in the regular course of its business 
operations to third parties where OS and its officers, directors, 
agents and affiliates have no reason to believe that such 
information may be utilized to evaluate an Acquisition Proposal. 
OS and its officers, directors and affiliates (a) do not have any 
agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any 
Acquisition Proposal, (b) will cease and cause to be terminated 
any and all discussions with third parties regarding any 
Acquisition Proposal and (c) will promptly notify AII if any 
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or contact with any person 
or entity with respect thereto, is made. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, OS' Board of Directors may respond to unsolicited 
inquiries or proposals that it determines in exercising its 
fiduciary duties could, if consummated, reasonably be expected to 
be in the best interests of OS and its shareholders (it being 
understood that the foregoing shall in no way limit AII's right 
to expense reimbursement pursuant to Section 3 above).

5. Miscellaneous. Except for paragraphs 3 and 4 of this 
letter which shall be binding upon the parties hereto, this 
letter is not intended to be a binding agreement between the 
parties hereto and the parties hereby agree and acknowledge that 
neither OS nor AII shall be so bound unless and until a 
definitive purchase agreement has been executed with respect to 
this proposed transaction. This letter may be executed in two or 
more counterparts.

If you are in agreement with the terms of this proposal 
letter, please sign in the space provided below and return a 
signed copy on or prior to October 3, 1994. If this proposal 
letter has not been accepted prior to such date, this proposal 
letter will terminate and be of no further force or effect.

Very truly yours,

AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.
