Item 5. Other Events.

EIP Capital Corporation ("EIP"), the managing general
partner of the general partner of the Registrant, Victor K.
Atkins, Jr., its president and a director, and Paul Bagley, a
director, were among the defendants in a lawsuit filed on March
5, 1993 by a minority shareholder of EIP, Lehman Brothers, Inc.
and others, which sought the replacement of these two directors
and monetary damages of unspecified amounts from the defendants. 
On March 8, 1993, certain of the defendants in the above action
brought an action against one of the plaintiffs in the above
action and others seeking, among other things, a determination
that the two defendant directors had been properly elected as
directors of EIP. On August 25, 1994, all the parties to the
March 5, 1993 action entered into a settlement agreement. All
claims against all defendants in both such actions have been
dismissed with prejudice. In connection with the settlement
agreement, Ron Hiram has agreed to resign as a director of EIP.

On August 25, 1994, the Registrant announced a plan to
convert from a publicly traded limited partnership to a publicly
traded corporation (the "Transaction"). A copy of the press
release relating to this announcement, which more fully describes
the proposed Transaction, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

In connection with such proposed Transaction, W. Hall
Wendel, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of Polaris Industries
Capital Corporation, a general partner of the general partner of
Polaris Industries L.P. (which is the entity that operates the
Registrant's business and all of the limited partnership
interests in which are owned by the Registrant), and Victor K.
Atkins, Jr., a general partner of EIP Associates L.P., the
general partner of the Registrant, have entered into an Agreement
dated as of August 25, 1994 (the "Agreement"). A copy of the
Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. The Agreement
provides, among other things, that (i) each of Mr. Wendel and Mr.
Atkins will vote their Units of Beneficial Assignment of Class A
Limited Partnership Interests ("BACs") of the Registrant in favor
of the Transaction; (ii) subject to his fiduciary duties as
advised by counsel, Mr. Atkins will work diligently to proceed
with the Transaction and submit it to the BAC holders for their
approval as soon as possible; (iii) each of Mr. Wendel and Mr.
Atkins will use his best efforts to see that the business and
affairs of the Registrant will be conducted and distributions
will be made only in the ordinary course and consistent with past
practice; and (iv) for so long as Mr. Atkins owns no less than 3%
of the outstanding voting securities, he will vote such
securities in favor of the new corporation's ("Newco") nominees
for election to the Board of Directors of Newco. Mr. Atkins has
indicated to Mr. Wendel that he does not desire to continue in
the management of the Registrant following consummation of the
Transaction; accordingly, it is understood that Mr. Atkins will
not serve as an officer or director of Newco or its subsidiaries
following consummation of the Transaction.

POLARIS INDUSTRIES PARTNERS L.P. ANNOUNCES PLAN
TO CONVERT TO CORPORATION

Southampton, NY - August 25, 1994 - Polaris Industries
Partners L.P. (AMEX:SNO) today announced a plan to convert
Polaris from a publicly traded limited partnership to a publicly
traded corporation. The plan was proposed by W. Hall Wendel,
Jr., Polaris' Chief Executive Officer, who owns approximately
5.4% of the outstanding units, and other members of the senior
management of Polaris Industries L.P.

The plan contemplates that the holders of currently
outstanding units would receive 88.6% and EIP Associates L.P.,
Polaris' General Partner, would receive 11.4%, respectively, of
the stock of the newly formed corporation. Any conversion of
Polaris into corporate form would be subject to, among other
factors, satisfactory structuring and documentation, receipt of
appropriate tax opinions, receipt of regulatory approvals and a
second investment banking fairness opinion and the favorable vote
of unitholders.

Polaris intends to operate in the ordinary course and
to continue its current distribution policy up until the time the
transaction is closed.

Polaris has received the advice of Smith Barney Inc.,
its financial adviser, that the terms of the transaction are fair
to the unitholders from a financial point of view.

Although Polaris is publicly traded, it is treated as a
partnership, rather than a corporation, for federal income tax
purposes under a grandfather provision of the Internal Revenue
Code enacted in 1987. Under current tax law, this grandfather
protection ends immediately if Polaris engages in a substantially
new line of business, and, in any event, at the end of 1997, at
which time Polaris will be treated as a corporation for tax
purposes. Polaris has participated in efforts to have the
grandfather protection for existing publicly traded partnerships
made permanent or further extended, but the outcome of these
efforts is uncertain.

Additionally, the General Partner believes that Polaris
would derive a number of benefits from a conversion to corporate
form. It would enable the company to enter into new lines of
business without involuntarily jeopardizing its tax status. 
Conversion to corporate form should also provide Polaris greater
flexibility to consummate acquisitions or obtain financing
through the issuance of stock. Importantly, at the present time,
Polaris is not a suitable investment for pension plans and other
tax exempt institutions. Upon conversion to corporate form,
Polaris will become a suitable investment for tax exempt
investors, thereby greatly expanding the number of investors to
whom Polaris could be an attractive investment. Furthermore,
because Polaris is a partnership, its income is taxed currently
to unitholders regardless of the amount of cash distributions
which are made to them. Starting this year and for the
foreseeable future, Polaris expects that there will be increasing
differences between taxable income and cash available for
distribution arising from capital investment necessary to
continue growth of the business, reducing each unitholder's net
after tax distributable amount. If Polaris were to convert to
corporate form, its income would be taxed at the corporate level,
and investors would only be taxed on any amounts actually
distributed to them. Lastly, conversion to corporate form will
simplify tax reporting, including the elimination of the
requirement to distribute K-1s to investors, and will otherwise
significantly simplify the organizational structure of Polaris
resulting in substantial administrative and other savings.

It should be noted, however, that conversion to
corporate form would result in taxation at the corporate level
and, to the extent of cash dividends, on distributions at the
shareholder level. Company policies relating to cash
distributions to equity holders, as well as other policies, which
would be established by a Board of Directors elected by
shareholders rather than by a general partner, could change
substantially.

Polaris intends to proceed promptly to finalize the
conversion arrangements and implement the transaction, which it
anticipates completing within six months.

Polaris also announced that it will pay its regular
third quarter distribution of $0.63 per unit to holders of record
on September 15, 1994. The units go "ex-dividend" on September
9, 1994. Payment of this distribution will be made on or about
November 15, 1994.

Polaris Industries Partners L.P. is a master limited
partnership which owns and operates Polaris Industries L.P. 
Polaris designs, engineers, manufactures and markets snowmobiles,
all-terrain vehicles and personal watercraft for recreational and
utility use. Polaris is the world's largest snowmobile
manufacturer, and one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of ATVs
and personal watercraft. Polaris Industries Partners L.P. trades
on the American Stock Exchange and Pacific Stock Exchange under
the symbol "SNO."

POLARIS INDUSTRIES PARTNERS L.P. ANNOUNCES PLAN
TO CONVERT TO CORPORATION

Southampton, NY - August 25, 1994 - Polaris Industries
Partners L.P. (AMEX:SNO) today announced a plan to convert
Polaris from a publicly traded limited partnership to a publicly
