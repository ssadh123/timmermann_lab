EXHIBIT 21(a)

Louisville, Ky., February 10, 1994 -- Thomas Industries Inc.
(NYSE-TII) today reported that sales and earnings for the year ended
December 31, 1993, improved over 1992 results.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 1993, was
$3,805,000, or $.38 per share, compared to a loss of $2,032,000,
or $.20 per share in 1992. The 1993 net income includes a fourth
quarter restructuring charge of $2,040,000. Net income for 1992
included a $3,986,000 restructuring charge. Net sales in 1993
improved 7% to $450,149,000, versus $420,754,000 in 1992.

Timothy C. Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Thomas Industries Inc., said, "The restructuring actions were
necessary in order to implement cost reduction strategies within the
Commercial & Industrial Lighting Division, primarily related to the
closing of our Long Island facility. We continue to take actions
required to enhance Thomas Lighting's competitive position in a
difficult marketplace."

The 1993 net income excluding this non-recurring charge is

$5,845,000, or $.58 per share.

Additionally, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $.10 per share, payable April 1, 1994, to shareholders
of record March 4, 1994. This will be the 155th consecutive cash
dividend paid by the Company.

In discussing the year-end results, Mr. Brown said, "Once
again, our Compressor and Vacuum Pump Group reported the highest
sales and earnings for any year in the Company's history. In the
Lighting Group, our outdoor lines -- Gardco, Emco and, in Canada,
Lumec -- continued to post strong operating results. Although our
Commercial & Industrial and Residential Divisions continued to
struggle in a very competitive market, we feel confident that the
cost cutting programs that we have implemented will have a positive
impact in 1994."

Thomas Industries designs, manufactures and markets commercial,
industrial and residential lighting products, fractional horsepower
compressors and vacuum pumps, as well as specialty products. Thomas
has operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe
and Asia.
