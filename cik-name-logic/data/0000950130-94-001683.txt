This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed by Reliance Insurance
Company, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Reliance").

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On November 28, 1994, Reliance received an order from the outgoing
insurance commissioner of California ordering it to pay refunds to its
policyholders under California Proposition 103 totaling $44,751,102, plus
interest of 10% from May 8, 1989 through the date of payment. Reliance
understands that similar orders have been issued to 27 other insurance
companies, with the commissioner seeking a total of $1.25 billion in refunds
from the 28 carriers.

Reliance believes that, overall, it did not earn a fair rate of return on
its California business, and intends to contest vigorously the refund order and 
the application to Reliance of the regulations pursuant to which it was issued.
The validity of the implementation of California's Proposition 103 rate rollback
requirement is being appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States by
another insurance company.
