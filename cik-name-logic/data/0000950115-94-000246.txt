ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On September 30, 1994, MEDIQ Incorporated (the 'Company') acquired, through
wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain assets used by the medical equipment rental
division of Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ('KCI') for a purchase price of approximately
$65.3 million in cash and $18.8 million principal amount of notes payable to 
KCI. The purchase price may be reduced based on a post-closing audit.

The assets acquired primarily consist of moveable critical care and life
support rental equipment similar in type and use to the rental medical equipment
currently utilized by the Company's subsidiary, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services,
Inc. ('MEDIQ/PRN'). The assets acquired are now being integrated into 
MEDIQ/PRN's medical equipment rental business.

The cash portion of the consideration was financed with a term loan in the
amount of $43 million from Congress Financial Corporation, subordinated notes in
the amount of $10 million from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and
its affiliates, and from working capital of the Company.

SECTION 3. CLOSING PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS.

3.1 Closing Statement.

(a) Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall cause to be prepared
a statement as of the close of business on the Closing Date, which shall
set forth (i) the Assets acquired by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.1 and (ii)
the Assumed Liabilities assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.2(a). Each
line item included in (i) and (ii) above shall be accounted for
consistently with United States generally accepted accounting principles
('GAAP') applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the February
Statement (as defined herein). Such statement of assets and liabilities
prepared as provided in this Section 3.1 is referred to herein as the
'Closing Statement.' Seller shall, at its sole expense, engage KPMG Peat
Marwick ('Seller's Auditors') to perform an audit in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards with respect to the Closing
Statement. Buyer, MEDIQ and Seller shall cooperate fully with such audit
and shall use best efforts to cause their respective affiliates so to
cooperate, so as to cause Seller's Auditors to complete such audit within
40 days after the Closing Date. Buyer and Buyer's independent public
accountants ('Buyer's Auditors') shall have the opportunity, at Buyer's
sole expense, to review the work papers of Seller and Seller's Auditors
relating to such audit.

(b) Upon completion of such audit, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (i)
the Closing Statement, (ii) the calculation of Net Asset Value (as defined
below), in each case as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and
(iii) Seller's Auditors' unqualified opinion on the Closing Statement to
the effect that (A) the Closing Statement is accounted for in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the
February Statement and the requirements of this Section 3 and (B) the
calculation of Net Asset Value complies with the requirements of this
Section 3.

(c) Unless Buyer notifies Seller within 30 days after receipt of the
Closing Statement and calculation of Net Asset Value of any objections
thereto (specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor), such Closing
Statement and calculation shall be the definitive Closing Statement and
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes. If Buyer timely
notifies Seller of any such objection, Buyer and Seller shall, together
with Seller's Auditors and Buyer's Auditors, attempt in good faith to reach
an agreement as to the matter in dispute. If the parties shall have failed
to resolve such disputed matter within ten (10) business days after receipt
of notice of such objection, then any such disputed matter shall, at the
instance of Buyer or Seller, be submitted to and resolved by a national
accounting firm other than Seller's Auditors and Buyer's Auditors
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller. The fees and expenses of any
such accounting firm incurred in resolving the disputed matters shall be
divided equally between Seller and Buyer. The Closing Statement and
calculation of Net Asset Value shall, after adjustment to reflect the
resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section 3.1, be the definitive
Closing Statement and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes.

3.2 Post Closing Adjustment.

(a) If the amount of inventories set forth on the Closing Statement is
less than $3,479,000, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer the
amount of the difference.

(b) If the sum of (i) Net Asset Value set forth on the Closing
Statement and (ii) the amount, if any, by which the amount of inventories
set forth on the Closing Statement exceeds $3,479,000 is less than
$37,283,177, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to Buyer the amount of
the difference.

(c) Seller shall, at the time it delivers the Closing Statement and
other documents pursuant to Section 3.1(b), pay Buyer any and all amounts
payable pursuant to Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b) based on the Closing
Statement delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 3.1(b), together with

10
<PAGE>

interest thereon from the Closing Date at the rate of 8% per annum. If the
amount paid by Seller pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to
either or both of Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b) (and if no amount has been
paid with respect thereto, an amount equal to zero shall be deemed to have
been paid) is (i) less than the amount payable pursuant to Sections 3.2(a)
and 3.2(b) based upon the definitive Closing Statement referred to in
Section 3.1(c), Seller shall, within five business days following the date
on which such definitive Closing Statement becomes final, binding and
conclusive pursuant to Section 3.1(c), pay Buyer the difference, together
with interest thereon from the Closing Date at the rate of 8% per annum or
(ii) greater than the amount payable pursuant to Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b)
based upon the definitive Closing Statement referred in Section 3.1(c),
Buyer shall, within five business days following the date on which such
definitive Closing Statement becomes final, binding and conclusive pursuant
to Section 3.1(c), pay Seller the excess, together with interest thereon
from the date on which Buyer received such amount from Seller at the rate
of 8% per annum. All payments by Seller made pursuant to this Section 3.2
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Buyer.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, 'Net Asset Value' shall mean the
sum of (i) the net book value of the assets other than inventories included
in the Assets (other than Assets acquired by Seller from Highline as a
result of the termination of the Highline Agreement), plus (ii) an amount
equal to depreciation expense for the Assets for the period from February
28, 1994 to and including the Closing Date, minus (iii) all indebtedness
and other liabilities assumed pursuant to Section 2.2(a), in each case to
the extent set forth on the Closing Statement and determined in accordance
with the requirements of Section 3.1.

3.3 Certain Payments.

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer and MEDIQ shall establish and fund an
escrow account (the 'Escrow') maintained by a third party reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Seller (the 'Escrow Agent') in an amount equal to
$1.6 million (the 'Escrow Payment'). All payments made pursuant to this
Section 3.3 shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the escrow agreement attached hereto as Exhibit II (the 'Escrow
Agreement'). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that payments shall be made
by the Escrow Agent to Seller in order to reimburse Seller (up to an
aggregate maximum amount of $1.6 million) for (i) severance payments
actually made by Seller to employees of Seller identified in Schedule 1 to
the Escrow Agreement whose employment is terminated by Seller after the
date hereof and before the 90th day after the Closing Date and who (A) do
not become employees of Buyer, MEDIQ or an Affiliate of MEDIQ or (B) become
employees of Buyer, MEDIQ or an Affiliate of MEDIQ after the Closing
(collectively, 'Transferred Employees') whose employment with Buyer or
MEDIQ or an Affiliate of MEDIQ is terminated by Buyer or MEDIQ or an
Affiliate of MEDIQ prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
except any such Transferred Employee terminated by Buyer or MEDIQ or an
Affiliate of MEDIQ for reasons that would constitute 'cause' as set forth
in the modified form of Buyer's personnel policies described in Exhibit III
hereto or (C) are Transferred Employees whose employment with Buyer or
MEDIQ or an Affiliate of MEDIQ is terminated by the employee as a result of
any action by Buyer or MEDIQ or an Affiliate of MEDIQ materially decreasing
the employee's level of responsibility, salary or benefits or transferring
the employee to a location greater than 25 miles of the principal place of
his employment with Seller; (ii) payments by Seller to Jonathan M. Sadock
referred to in Section 3.3(e); (iii) payments by Seller to Robert A.
Wehrmeyer, Jr. referred to in Section 3.3(f); and (iv) the employer's
portion of FICA taxes relating to any of the foregoing. The aggregate
amount payable to reimburse Seller for (i) payments in respect of any
employee and the employer's portion of FICA taxes relating to such payments
shall not exceed the amount shown for such employee in Schedule 1 to the
Escrow Agreement and (ii) payments to Mr. Sadock shall not exceed the
Sadock Amount (as hereinafter defined). In the case of any written inquiry
from Seller requesting that MEDIQ confirm whether or not a specified
Transferred Employee has been terminated for reasons that would constitute
'cause' as described in Exhibit III hereto, MEDIQ or Buyer shall promptly
respond to Seller with such information.

11
<PAGE>

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall (i) not be entitled to
reimbursement for severance payments relating to any employee of Seller (or
for the employer's portion of FICA taxes relating to such payments) who is
offered employment with Buyer, MEDIQ or an Affiliate of MEDIQ in writing on
or prior to the Closing Date for a similar position and level of
responsibility, at a location within 25 miles of the principal place of his
employment with Seller and at a similar salary and with similar benefits
and who does not accept such offer and (ii) pay Buyer all amounts paid to
Seller out of the Escrow with respect to any employee (other than Jonathan
M. Sadock, and, subject to Section 3.3(f), Robert A. Wehrmeyer, Jr.) who,
subject to Section 3.3(c), becomes an employee of, or independent
contractor or consultant to, or otherwise provides any other services to,
Seller or any Seller Affiliate prior to one year after such termination of
employment (each such payment by Seller to be made within 30 days after any
such event.

(c) The provisions of Section 3.3(b)(ii) shall not apply to, and
Seller shall not be required to reimburse Buyer for, severance payments to
employees who are offered employment relating to the transition arising
from the transactions contemplated under this Agreement by Seller or a
Seller Affiliate on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that if any such
employee remains in the employ of Seller or a Seller Affiliate for a period
of one (1) year or more following the Closing Date, Seller will pay Buyer,
within 30 days after the expiration of such one year period, all amounts
paid to Seller out of the Escrow on account of any such employee.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein provided, the
limitations of Section 3.3(b)(i) shall not apply to the employees of Seller
listed in Schedule 2 to the Escrow Agreement.

(e) Of the Escrow Payment, the Sadock Amount (as defined below) is to
be paid to reimburse Seller for payments to Jonathan M. Sadock in
satisfaction of all obligations of Seller to Mr. Sadock (including, without
limitation, severance, commissions and rights under employment agreements).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall not be
entitled to receive out of the Escrow any reimbursement for payments to Mr.
Sadock unless Seller shall have previously delivered to Buyer the duly
executed agreement of Mr. Sadock to the effect that the non-competition
obligations of Mr. Sadock set forth in the Employment Agreement dated
October 2, 1990 between Mr. Sadock and Medirec are in full force and effect
and will continue, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such
Employment Agreement, in full force and effect through April 1, 1996, and
shall be deemed for the benefit of, and enforceable by Buyer. The 'Sadock
Amount' shall mean an amount equal to $175,000 minus the aggregate amount
of compensation (including, without limitation, salary, commissions and
bonus, but not including expense reimbursement and health benefit payments)
paid (or which should have been paid) by KCI, Seller or a Seller Affiliate
to Mr. Sadock for periods after August 31, 1994, through the Closing Date.

(f) The amount payable to Robert A. Wehrmeyer, Jr. from the Escrow
pursuant to this Section shall be payable whether or not Seller's payment
to him constitutes severance and whether or not he continues to be an
employee of or becomes an independent contractor or consultant to Seller or
any Seller Affiliate. However, Seller shall pay to Buyer all amounts paid
to Seller out of the Escrow with respect to Mr. Wehrmeyer if and only if
Mr. Wehrmeyer continues to be or becomes an employee of or independent
contractor or consultant to Seller or a Seller Affiliate and his activities
in that capacity (i) constitute an activity in which Seller may not engage
pursuant to Section 9.3 hereof or (ii) are in pursuance of the therapeutic
bed portion of the KCITS Business (other than consulting with respect to
certain pending litigation). Such repayment shall be made within 30 days
after the event giving rise to the requirement to make the repayment.

3.4 Accounts Receivable.

(a) Seller's Auditors will within 15 business days after the Closing
Date perform agreed upon procedures as set forth on Schedule 3.4 with
respect to a schedule (prepared by Seller) of accounts receivable of the
Division which are due and payable as of Closing and with respect to any
unbilled amounts accrued through the Closing Date; Seller will deliver to
Buyer a copy of such

12
<PAGE>

schedule within 2 business days of the completion of the performance of
such agreed upon procedures thereon by Seller's Auditors. The cost of
preparation of such schedule will be borne half by Seller and half by
Buyer.

(b) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
each customer of the Medical Services Business with respect to amounts
which have not previously been invoiced by Seller an invoice for all
services rendered, equipment rented and products sold through the Closing
Date, along with a notification satisfactory to Buyer of the sale of the
Medical Services Business. Seller shall promptly deliver copies thereof to
Buyer after delivery thereof to customers. All such invoices shall be
consistent with the schedule prepared in accordance with subsection (a).
Seller shall deliver prorated invoices in any instances in which the end of
Seller's billing cycle for such customers does not correspond to the
Closing Date. Any payment or proceeds received from any customer with
respect to such invoices or any accounts receivable of the Division which
are due and payable as of the Closing are the property of Seller, and if
received by Buyer shall be remitted within five business days to Seller in
the form received, endorsed by Buyer to the order of Seller (if necessary).
Any payment or proceeds with respect to services rendered or equipment
rented or products sold after the Closing Date are the property of Buyer,
and if received by Seller shall be remitted within five business days to
Buyer in the form received, endorsed by Seller to the order of Buyer (if
necessary). Any payment received respecting which a customer has not
specified the accounts receivable to which it should be applied shall be

disputed by that customer.

laws of the jurisdictions identified in the Disclosure Statement, which
includes each jurisdiction in which its ownership or leasing of assets or
properties relating to the Division or the operation of the Division
requires such qualification.

other rights with respect to any such equity interests or other securities
of such corporation and there are no offers, options, warrants, rights,
agreements or commitments of any kind (contingent or otherwise) relating to
the issuance, conversion, voting, sale or transfer of any such equity
interests or securities or obligating Seller or any other person to
purchase or redeem any such equity interests or other securities.

4.2 Power and Authorization. Seller and KCI have the corporate right, power
and authority to enter into and perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement and under the other agreements and documents (the 'Seller Transaction
Documents') required to be delivered by them under this Agreement prior to or at
the Closing. The execution, delivery and performance by Seller and KCI of their
respective obligations under this Agreement and the Seller Transaction Documents
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and KCI and, assuming the
due execution and delivery by Buyer and MEDIQ, constitutes the respective legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of them, enforceable against each of them
in accordance with its terms. When executed and delivered as contemplated

13
<PAGE>

herein, each of the Seller Transaction Documents shall, assuming the due
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, constitute the respective
legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller and KCI, enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms. Upon transfer of the Assets to Buyer at
Closing as contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall acquire good and valid
title thereto (other than any interest in Real Property), free and clear of any
restriction, mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien, security interest or other
charge, claim or encumbrance, other than the Assumed Liabilities and any
restriction, mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien, security interest or other
charge, claim or encumbrance placed upon the Assets by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

Seller or KCI or any applicable law (including, without limitation,
principles of common law), statute, regulation, permit, license,
certificate, judgment, order, award or other decision or requirement
of any arbitrator, court, government or governmental agency or
instrumentality (domestic or foreign) (collectively, 'Laws') binding
upon Seller or KCI or any of the Assets;

(ii) violate or conflict with, result in a breach or
termination of, or constitute a default or otherwise cause any loss

cancellation or acceleration), in or with respect to any of the
Assets; or

(iii) except as contemplated in the Negative Covenants
Agreement (as hereinafter defined), result in or require the
creation or imposition of any restriction, mortgage, deed of trust,
pledge, lien, security interest or other charge, claim or
encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Assets.

(b) The Disclosure Statement sets forth each consent or approval of,
or registration, notification, filing and/or declaration with, any court,
government or governmental agency or instrumentality, creditor, lender,
lessor or other person required to be given or made by Seller in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
other agreements and instruments contemplated herein. Except as described
in the Disclosure Statement, all such consents, approvals, registrations,
notifications, filings and declarations have been obtained or made or will
be obtained or made or the requirement therefor waived in writing prior to
the Closing without loss of benefit to the Medical Services Business (or
Buyer as the successor to the Medical Services Business).

(c) There are no judicial, administrative or other governmental
actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
Seller or KCI, threatened, that question any of the transactions

the other agreements or instruments contemplated hereby or which, if
adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect upon Seller's or
KCI's ability to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement
or any of the other agreements or instruments contemplated hereby. Neither
Seller nor KCI has received any request from any governmental agency or

guaranty the obligations of any person or entity.

4.5 Compliance with Laws. Except as described in the Disclosure Statement,
Seller, with respect to the Division, is in compliance, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws and does not have any basis to expect, and

Medical Services Business or any of the Assets, or any of Seller's directors,
officers or shareholders in their capacities as such, before or by any court,
government, governmental agency or instrumentality, or before an arbitrator of
any kind; and there is no pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation which, if determined adversely, could either individually or in
the aggregate have a material effect on the earnings, business, operations or
financial condition of the Division, or could result in a liability in excess of
$25,000 in the case of any single action or $100,000 in the case of all such
actions in the aggregate. To Seller's or KCI's knowledge, except as described in

(ii) and (iii)) would not have a material adverse effect on the Assets or the
Medical Services Business, and no such consent or approval (A) shall have been
conditioned upon the modification, cancellation or termination of any lease,
commitment, agreement or right of Seller included in the Assets or (B) shall

any Seller Affiliate shall, directly or indirectly: (i) engage, anywhere in
the United States of America, in the rental of a portfolio of
standard-of-care medical products manufactured by third parties (examples
of which include but are not limited to the products identified on Schedule
1.1.1); or (ii) be or become a stockholder, partner, owner, officer,
director or employee or agent of, or a consultant to or give financial or
other assistance to, any person or entity considering engaging in any such
activities or so engaged; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prohibit Seller, KCI and/or any Seller Affiliate from (A) owning, as
passive investors, in the aggregate not more than 5.0% of the outstanding
publicly traded stock of any corporation so engaged or (B) engaging in the
KCITS Business or (C) engaging in the manufacture, sale, lease, rental,
distribution or marketing of any medical product or equipment (including,
without limitation, the PlexiPulse and any other product or product-line
acquired or developed by Seller, KCI or a Seller Affiliate) (1) that
Seller, KCI or a Seller Affiliate manufactures, (2) with respect to which
Seller, KCI or a Seller Affiliate owns proprietary rights (including,
without limitation, through development of such product or equipment), or
(3) for which KCI, Seller or a Seller Affiliate has distribution rights
(but nothing in this clause (C)(3) shall permit KCI, Seller or any Seller
Affiliate to obtain distribution rights for a series of products
manufactured by third parties such that Seller and/or its Affiliates are
engaged in the rental of a portfolio of standard-of-care products), or (D)
engaging in the business conducted by KCI Financial Services, Inc. a
wholly-owned subsidiary of KCI, on the date hereof, including, without
limitation, the leasing and 'rent-to-own' types of financing. The duration
of Seller's and KCI's covenants set forth in this Section shall be extended
by a period of time equal to the number of days, if any, during which
Seller or KCI is in violation of the provisions hereof.

(b) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date,
neither Seller, KCI nor any Seller Affiliate shall, directly or indirectly
use in furtherance of any of their business affairs or otherwise and to the
detriment of Buyer with respect to the Medical Services Business, or
disclose to any third party except as required by Law, any trade secret,
customer list, supplier list, financial data, pricing or marketing policy
or plan or any other proprietary or confidential information relating
exclusively to the Medical Services Business or any of its products or
services so long as the same is not publicly known (other than by the act
of Seller, KCI or any Seller Affiliate).

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, an 'Affiliate' of a person
means: (i) any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other
entity of which such person owns or otherwise possesses the power to direct
the vote, directly or indirectly, of an amount of voting securities
sufficient to elect a majority of the board of directors of such
corporation, and (ii) any other person or entity controlled by such person.
For the purposes of this definition of 'Affiliate,' 'control' means the
power to direct the management and policies of a person or entity, directly
or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise; provided that, any person or entity of which a
person owns beneficially or of record, either directly or through one or
more intermediaries, more than 20% of the ownership interests, shall be
conclusively presumed to be an 'Affiliate' of such person. A 'Seller
Affiliate' is an Affiliate of Seller or KCI.

(d) If any party hereto learns of any breach or potential breach of
Section 9.3, such party shall immediately notify the other party hereto of
such event, specifying the basis therefor in

29
<PAGE>

reasonable detail. Buyer may, in its sole discretion, afford Seller and KCI
an opportunity to remedy or otherwise cure such breach or potential breach
before seeking legal redress, provided that Seller and KCI are actively
seeking to cure or remedy such breach or potential breach; but such
opportunity to remedy shall be without prejudice to the right of Buyer to
seek and obtain injunctive or other relief.

(e) Seller and KCI acknowledge that damages alone shall not be an
adequate remedy for any breach by Seller, KCI or any Seller Affiliate of
Seller's covenants contained in this Agreement and accordingly expressly
agree that, in addition to any other remedies which Buyer may have, Buyer
shall be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction for any breach or threatened breach of any such covenants by
Seller, KCI and/or any Seller Affiliate.

(f) Seller and KCI acknowledge and agree that the covenants contained
in this Section 9.3 are fair and reasonable in light of the consideration
paid hereunder and in order to protect Buyer's investment through its
acquisition of the Assets in the Medical Services Business, and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision, or part of any
provision, of this Section shall not affect the other provisions or parts
hereof. If any provision hereof is determined to be invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, Seller and KCI shall
negotiate in good faith to provide Buyer with protection as nearly
equivalent to that found to be invalid or unenforceable and if any such
provision shall be so determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason
of the duration or geographical scope of the covenants contained therein,
such duration or geographical scope, or both, shall be considered to be
reduced to a duration or geographical scope to the extent necessary to cure
such invalidity. The parties acknowledge and agree that the amount of
Buyer's damages for any breach by Seller and KCI of the provisions of this
Section 9.3 shall be determined without reference to, and irrespective of,
the allocation of the Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4.

9.4 Provisions Relating to Employees.

(a) Except as set forth in Sections 2.2(d) and 3.3, Seller and KCI
shall be solely responsible for any severance pay, accrued salary, pension
benefit, unemployment compensation, vacation pay and any other obligations
to present or former employees created or owing as a consequence of the
termination or prior employment (whether by agreement, policy or by Law) of
any employees of Seller involved in the Medical Services Business. Seller
and KCI shall be solely responsible for preparing and filing for all their
Pension Plans and Welfare Plans all Forms 5500 (Annual Return/Report of
Employee Benefit Plan) and all other reports and filings required with
respect thereto. Seller and KCI shall remain solely responsible for any and
all violations of the Code and/or ERISA with respect to Seller's and KCI's
Pension Plans and Welfare Plans (including the reporting and disclosure
requirements and the fiduciary standards), and shall be solely responsible
for all continuation coverage requirements of the Code and ERISA with
respect to all such plans and for all such continuation coverage
requirements as a result of the sale of Assets to Buyer or any termination
of Seller's employees following the sale of Assets.

(b) Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole
discretion to offer to employ employees of Seller who are employed in the
Medical Services Business on the last business day prior to the Closing
Date, on terms and conditions determined solely by Buyer; provided that
Buyer shall not have any obligation to continue the employment of any such
person hired by Buyer or to provide any benefits or pay any salaries
comparable to those provided by Seller.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 2.2(d) or Section 3.3, Buyer is not
assuming, nor shall Buyer be responsible for any liability or obligation
whatsoever to any present or former employee of Seller, or any liability or
obligation under any Employee Benefit Plan with respect to any present or
former employee of Seller whether or not such present or former employee is
hired by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.4(b).

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
Closing occurs, Buyer and MEDIQ shall be responsible for any and all
liabilities, obligations, commitments, costs and

30
<PAGE>

expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys and
other advisors, incurred in respect of any Transferred Employee relating to
or arising in connection with any and all claims made after the Closing
Date for workers compensation benefits arising in connection with any
occupational injury or disease occurring after the Closing Date.

9.5 Transitional Activities. From and after the Closing, Seller promptly
shall forward or refer to Buyer any orders, inquiries and requests received by
any of them for the sale, lease or rental of, or with respect to, the Assets
sold to Buyer hereunder, and shall take all other actions reasonably requested
by Buyer to assist in the prompt and orderly transition of the Medical Services
Business to Buyer.

9.6 Delivery of Financials. Within 40 days after the Closing, Seller and
KCI shall provide with respect to the Division: audited statements of assets
being purchased and liabilities being assumed for the years ended December 31,

extent required for compliance by Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates with the
requirements of Rule 13a-11 of the SEC issued pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.
The expense of such audit shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. In
addition, Seller shall reasonably cooperate and cause Seller's Auditors to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and Buyer's Auditors in the preparation of any
other financial statements or schedules required to enable Buyer and Buyer's
affiliates to comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and
regulations.

not currently rented) of all of the equipment constituting Assets and confirming
the transfer of such Assets to Buyer.

9.8 Employee Health Insurance. From and after the effective time of
Closing, all employees of Seller who are employed by Buyer as of the Closing

KCI or any Seller Affiliate and shall, at the employee's election, commence
participation, on a basis whereby all waiting period and pre-existing condition
requirements shall have been waived or shall otherwise be inapplicable to such
employees (and covered dependents), in health insurance plans maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer. Any such health insurance plan maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall only cover (to the extent provided in such
plan) claims relating to health care services rendered after the Closing Date.
The health insurance plans maintained by Seller, KCI or a Seller Affiliate shall
cover (to the extent provided in such plans) all claims relating to health care
services rendered to such employees (and covered dependents) on or prior to the
Closing Date.

9.9 Customer Pricing. From and after Closing, Buyer shall, with respect to
all customer contracts of Seller relating to the Medical Services Business that
do not constitute Assumed Contracts, honor each pricing arrangement between
Seller and a customer of Seller under each such contract during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier to occur of (i) the date
90 days after the Closing and (ii) the date on which such pricing arrangement
(or the customer contract to which it relates), by its terms, expires.

third parties to the assignment to Buyer of Assumed Contracts that provide for
the provision by Seller or a Seller Affiliate of M.E.M.S. or C.A.P.S. or
maintenance with respect thereto (collectively, 'Computer Support'), Seller
shall propose to the other parties to such contracts alternate arrangements
mutually satisfactory to, and approved by, Seller and Buyer, with respect to the
provision of such software or services from and after Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent the third parties to
any such Assumed Contracts included in the Assets do not accept any such
proposed alternate arrangements, KCI and Seller shall, from and after Closing,

11.3 Inter-Party Claims. Any party seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Section (an 'Indemnified Party') shall notify the other party or parties from
whom such indemnification is sought (an 'Indemnifying Party') of the Indemnified
Party's assertion of such claim for indemnification, specifying the basis of
such claim.

11.4 Third Party Claims.

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying 
Party of the assertion by any third party of any claim with
respect to which the indemnification set forth in this Section relates 
(which shall also constitute the notice required by Section 11.3). The 
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon notice to the Indemnified 
Party within twenty (20) days after the receipt of any such notice, to 
undertake the defense of or, with the consent of the Indemnified Party 
(which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), to settle or 
compromise such claim. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to give 
such notice and to undertake the defense of or to settle or compromise 
such a claim shall constitute a waiver of the Indemnifying Party's 
rights under this Section 11.4(a) and shall preclude the Indemnifying
Party from disputing the manner in which the Indemnified Party may 
conduct the defense of such claim or the reasonableness of any amount 
paid by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of such claim.

(b) The election by the Indemnifying Party, pursuant to Section
11.4(a), to undertake the defense of a third-party claim shall not preclude
the party against which such claim has been made also from participating or
continuing to participate in such defense, so long as such party bears its
own legal fees and expenses for so doing.

11.5 Limitations and Requirements. No party hereto shall have any
obligation to indemnify any other party hereto or any other person against
Damages pursuant to Section 11.1(a) (in the case of Seller and KCI) or Section
11.2(a) (in the case of Buyer, Holdings and MEDIQ) arising out of or based upon
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made in or
pursuant to this Agreement or any Transaction Document unless and until the
aggregate of all such Damages suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties
under this Agreement exceeds $750,000 (the 'Basket'); in which event such
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only for the amount of
all

33
<PAGE>

Damages suffered or incurred in excess of the Basket; provided, however, that
the above limitation shall not be applicable to any claim for Damages pursuant
to Sections 11.1 (b) through (f) (in the case of Seller and KCI) or Section
11.2(b) through (d) (in the case of Buyer, Holdings and MEDIQ) or based upon a
breach of any representation or warranty made in or pursuant to Sections 4.20 or
5.4 of this Agreement. The aggregate amount of all Damages for which Buyer may
be indemnified pursuant to Section 11.1(a) of this Agreement shall not exceed
$10,000,000, and the aggregate amount of all Damages for which Buyer may be
indemnified hereunder shall not exceed the sum of $81,300,000 and the Highline
Buy-Out Amount. It is specifically understood and agreed that in the event a
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant is discovered by Buyer and
asserted by it after the Closing, the remedy of Buyer shall be limited to
indemnification as set forth in this Section 11, and Buyer shall not be entitled
to a rescission of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in seeking indemnification for Damages solely under Section
11.1(a) of this Agreement, Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to set off
certain of the payments to be made to Seller pursuant to the promissory notes
delivered to Seller attached hereto as Exhibit IB (the 'IB Notes') in accordance
with Section 11.6 of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event the IB
Notes are pre-paid, in whole or in part, and the aggregate amount of Damages
under Section 11.1(a) for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification (subject to
the limitations set forth in this Section 11.5) exceeds the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of and accrued but unpaid interest under the IB
Notes, Buyer shall be entitled to recover such excess Damages first by setting
off, in accordance with Section 11.6, remaining payments to be made to Seller
under the Note in the form of Exhibit IC hereto; second by setting off, in
accordance with Section 11.6, remaining payments to be made to Seller under the
Note in the form of Exhibit IA hereto; and third (to the extent any excess
Damages have not been recovered through set off as aforementioned) by receiving
cash from Seller or KCI. To the extent that any claim for indemnification may
properly be made under Section 11.1 (a) or Section 11.2(a) and any other
provision of this Agreement, then such claim shall be deemed for all purposes of
this Section 11.5 to have arisen only under such other provision and not under
such Section 11.1(a) or Section 11.2(a), as the case may be. Each Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of a claim under Section 11.1(a) or
11.2(a) within the nine (9) month period referenced in Section 12.1(a), in
accordance with Section 11.3.

11.6 Right of Set-Off. Subject to the limitations in Section 11.5, Buyer
shall have the right to set-off, against any amount which may be owed by Buyer
or any Affiliate of MEDIQ to Seller pursuant to the Notes, any Damages owed by
Seller or KCI to Buyer under this Agreement, plus interest at a rate of 10% per
annum on such Damages accruing from the date that Buyer receives notice of claim
for such Damages. The exercise of such right of set-off by Buyer and the
consequent failure of Buyer or a MEDIQ Affiliate to pay amounts otherwise due
and payable under the Notes shall not constitute an event of default under the
Notes if: (a) Buyer shall have given Seller written notice of Buyer's intended
exercise of such set-off at least 30 days prior to the time amounts otherwise
due and payable under a Note (but for the exercise of such right of set-off)
would be due and payable under the terms of such Note and such notice shall have
specified (i) the aggregate amount that Buyer intends to set-off based on such
written notice (the 'Aggregate Set-Off Amount'), (ii) the Note or Notes against
which Buyer intends to effect some or all of the set-off contemplated in such
written notice and (iii) the identity of the banking institution (having assets
of at least $500 million) (the 'Selected Depository') at which Buyer will
establish an interest-bearing escrow account for deposit of the Contested Amount
(as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the following subclause; and (b)
after the Uncontested Amount (as hereinafter defined) has been set-off, Buyer
shall have deposited the Contested Amount into such escrow account in one or
more installments, each such installment to have been deposited in such escrow
account no later than the time the corresponding amount otherwise due and
payable under a Note (but for such set-off) would be payable under the terms of
such Note. At the time Buyer establishes the aforementioned escrow account, the
Selected Depository shall be instructed to (i) hold all amounts deposited into
escrow by Buyer in accordance with this Section 11.6, and interest earnings
attributable thereto, in escrow until such time as either (A) Buyer and Seller
deliver joint instructions to such banking institution regarding the disposition
of such funds or (B) a court of competent jurisdiction directs the disposition
of such funds out of escrow. 'Contested Amount' means the amount, if any, of

34
<PAGE>

the Aggregate Set-Off Amount which Seller asserts, in a written notice delivered
to Buyer no later than 20 days after the date of Buyer's exercise notice, Buyer
is not entitled to set off in accordance with this Agreement, provided that if
at any time prior to the deposit of some or all of the Contested Amount into
escrow Seller withdraws its previous objection with respect to some or all of
the Aggregate Set-Off Amount, the Contested Amount shall be reduced by the
amount with respect to which Seller has withdrawn its objection. 'Uncontested
Amount' means an amount equal to the Aggregate Set-Off Amount minus the
Contested Amount. Buyer shall be entitled to give more than one written notice
pursuant to this Section 11.6.

SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS.

12.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

(a) The representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3,
4.6, 4.7, 4.8(a), 4.11(b), 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16(c), 4.16(d), 4.17, 4.20,
5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.7(a) made by the parties in this Agreement and in the
certificates, documents and schedules delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated for a
period of nine (9) months (and thereafter during the time a claim with
respect thereto brought prior to the end of such nine (9) month period is
pending). The representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.6 shall
survive until all amounts owed under the Notes have been paid in full. The
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.9 shall survive for
the period described in such Section 4.9. The remaining representations and
warranties made by the parties shall not survive the Closing of the
transactions herein contemplated. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the representations and warranties of Seller and
KCI hereunder, and the right of Buyer to indemnification for breach
thereof, shall not be affected by any investigation of Seller, KCI or the
Medical Service Business made before or after the date hereof by Buyer,
MEDIQ or their agents or representatives.

(b) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements made in
the body of this Agreement and those contained in the Disclosure Statement

other party hereto shall reasonably request in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement and to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement and to
provide for the orderly and efficient transition of the Medical Services
Business to Buyer. Seller and KCI shall, for five years after the Closing,
retain their various books and records relating to the Medical Services Business
and shall, upon prior notice, provide Buyer and its authorized representatives
reasonable access thereto, and in any event shall not dispose of any of them
without first offering them to Buyer. Each party shall promptly notify the other
parties of any event or circumstance known to such party that could prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would
indicate a breach or non-compliance with any of the terms, conditions,
representations, warranties or agreements of any of the parties to this
Agreement.

12.3 Bulk Sales. The parties hereto waive compliance with all applicable
bulk sales laws, including, without limitation, the Uniform Commercial Code Bulk
Transfer provisions.

12.4 Costs and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
each party shall bear its own expenses in connection herewith. Any and all
transfer, sales, use, documentary and similar taxes and recording and filing
fees incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated herein shall be
borne by Buyer.

12.5 Public Announcements. Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Seller, KCI, Buyer and MEDIQ shall each issue a press release reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Buyer. Otherwise, neither Seller, KCI, Buyer, nor
MEDIQ shall, prior to the Closing, make any public announcement or

35
<PAGE>

disclosure relating to the transactions contemplated herein without the prior
agreement of each other party hereto, provided that each party shall use best
efforts to consult with the other in advance of any disclosure required by law,
but the agreement of the other parties hereto shall not be required.

12.6 Notices. All notices or other communications permitted or required
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given if and
when hand delivered to the persons set forth below or if sent by documented
overnight delivery service or registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,

12.7 Assignment and Benefit.

(a) Buyer may assign this Agreement in whole or in part (including,
without limitation, its rights with respect to some or all of the Assets
under Section 1.1 hereof) to any corporation which is a direct or indirect
majority-owned subsidiary of MEDIQ or to any person which becomes a
successor in interest (by purchase of assets or stock, or by merger or
otherwise) to Buyer; but no such assignment shall, without the written
consent of Seller, relieve Buyer, Holdings and MEDIQ of their respective
obligations hereunder. Seller shall not assign this Agreement or any rights
hereunder, or delegate any obligations hereunder, without prior written
consent of Buyer. Buyer agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its
consent to the assignment by Seller of all or a portion of its rights and
the delegation of all or a portion of its duties under this Agreement (and
the transfer, subject to Buyer's rights under this Agreement, of all or a
portion of the Assets and

36
<PAGE>

the Assumed Liabilities) to a Person wholly-owned, directly or indirectly,
by KCI, and if Buyer so consents, Buyer will accept the conveyance of such
portion of the Assets from such Person; but no such assignment or
delegation shall, without the written consent of Buyer, relieve Seller or
KCI of their respective obligations hereunder. Buyer may condition its
agreement to such an assignment on Seller's and KCI's agreement to furnish
pursuant to Section 9.6 any additional financial statements required for
the purposes stated in that Section, and Seller shall be responsible for
the additional expenses in preparing the statements required by Section 9.6
resulting from such assignment. No such assignment by Seller shall be made
unless Congress Financial Corporation consents thereto. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement and the rights and obligations set forth herein
shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto, and
each of their respective successors and assigns. In accordance with the
foregoing, Buyer intends prior to Closing to assign to First PRN Buyer's
rights under Section 1.1 with respect to the Assets described in Section
1.1(a)(ii) hereof and the customer contracts which constitute Assumed
Contracts (in which case Seller will transfer such Assets directly to First
PRN and not to Buyer at Closing).

(b) This Agreement shall not be construed as giving any person, other
than the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any of the provisions herein contained, this Agreement and all
provisions and conditions hereof being intended to be, and being, for the
sole and exclusive benefit of such parties, and permitted successors and
assigns and for the benefit of no other person or entity.

12.8 Amendment, Modification and Waiver. The parties may amend or modify
this Agreement in any respect. Any such amendment, or modification shall be in
writing. The waiver by a party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall not constitute or operate as a waiver of any other breach of such
provision or of any other provision hereof, nor shall any failure to enforce any
provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any other provision
hereof.

12.9 Governing Law. This Agreement is made pursuant to, and shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
(and United States federal law, to the extent applicable), irrespective of the
principal place of business, residence or domicile of the parties hereto, and
without giving effect to otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of law.

12.10 Section Headings and Defined Terms. The section headings contained
herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning and interpretation of this Agreement. The terms defined herein and in
any agreement executed in connection herewith include the plural as well as the
singular and the singular as well as the plural, and the use of masculine
pronouns shall include the feminine and neuter. Except as otherwise indicated,
all agreements defined herein refer to the same as from time to time amended or
supplemented or the terms thereof waived or modified in accordance herewith and
therewith.

12.11 Severability. Subject to Section 9.3, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any particular provision, or part of any provision, of this
Agreement shall not affect the other provisions or parts hereof, and this
Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable
provisions or parts were omitted.

12.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original; and any person may
become a party hereto by executing a counterpart hereof, but all of such
counterparts together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart
hereof to produce or account for any of the other counterparts.

12.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure
Statement, the agreements, exhibits, schedules and certificates referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Assets and assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings. The submission of a draft of
this Agreement or portions or summaries

37
<PAGE>

thereof does not constitute an offer to purchase or sell the Assets, it being
understood and agreed that Buyer, MEDIQ, Seller or KCI shall not be legally
obligated with respect to such a purchase or sale or to any other terms or
conditions set forth in such draft or portion or summary unless and until this
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by all parties.

12.14 Guaranty. KCI hereby guarantees all of the obligations of Seller
pursuant to this Agreement and shall be deemed a beneficiary of the terms of
this Agreement in consideration therefor. MEDIQ hereby guarantees all of the
obligations of Buyer and Holdings pursuant to this Agreement (the terms of
MEDIQ's guaranty with respect to amounts payable under the Notes are as set
forth in the Guaranty Agreement), and in consideration therefor shall be deemed
a beneficiary of this Agreement. Holdings hereby guarantees all of the
obligations of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (the terms of Holdings' guaranty
with respect to amounts payable under the Notes with respect to which Holdings
is not maker are as set forth in the Guaranty Agreement) and in consideration
therefor shall be deemed a beneficiary of this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has duly executed this
Agreement, all as of the date first above written.

AMENDMENT NO. 1
TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT is
dated as of September 30, 1994 by and among Kinetic Concepts,
Inc., KCI Therapeutic Services, Inc., MEDIQ Incorporated, PRN
Holdings, Inc. and MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I, Inc.

BACKGROUND

The parties hereto are parties to the Asset Purchase
Agreement dated as of August 23, 1994 (the "Asset Purchase
Agreement"). In accordance with Section 12.8 of the Asset
Purchase Agreement, the parties desire to amend certain
provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement immediately prior to
the consummation of the Closing under the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
set forth herein and in the Asset Purchase Agreement, the parties
hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

1. Capitalized terms used herein, unless separately
defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in
the Asset Purchase Agreement.

2. If the liabilities or obligations of Seller under
the first Assumed Capital Lease referred to on Schedule 1.1.3 to
the Asset Purchase Agreement (the Master Lease between Citicorp
North America, Inc. and Seller, as successor by merger to
Medirec, as amended and waived through and including as of
September 30, 1994 (the "Citicorp Lease")), are accelerated as a
result of any breach or default thereunder occurring on or after
the Closing Date pursuant to Paragraph 16(B), (C) or (D) of the
Citicorp Lease, then (i) Seller will immediately pay all
obligations and liabilities under the Citicorp Lease resulting
from such acceleration, and (ii) Buyer will pay to Seller the
payments that would have been payable under the Citicorp Lease as
and when such payments would have been due if no such breach or
default had occurred.

3. In the event of a default under the Citicorp Lease
under Paragraphs 16(B), (C) or (D) thereof, Seller and KCI shall,
upon request of Buyer, cooperate with Buyer and use all
reasonable efforts to promptly obtain a waiver of such default
from the Lessor thereunder.

4. (a) Section 11.1 of the Asset Purchase Agreement
is hereby amended by the insertion of the words "(including,
without limitation, Holdings and MEDIQ)" immediately after the
word "shareholders" appearing in such section.

(b) Schedule 2.4 to the Asset Purchase Agreement
is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety with Exhibit A
hereto.

(c) Section 12.4 of the Asset Purchase Agreement
is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

"12.4 Costs and Expenses. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, each party shall bear its
own expenses in connection herewith. Any and all
transfer, sales, use, documentary and similar taxes and
recording and filing fees incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated herein shall be borne by
Buyer. Notwithstanding the fact that Buyer, First PRN,
MEDIQ or any other Affiliate of MEDIQ may, in order to
facilitate the delivery of consents to assignments of
Assumed Contracts and Assumed Capital Leases, agree
with third parties to pay costs and expenses of such
third parties in connection with the assignment of
Assumed Contracts and Assumed Capital Leases hereunder,
Seller and KCI jointly and severally shall indemnify
and hold Buyer, First PRN, MEDIQ and any other
Affiliate of MEDIQ harmless from and against all such
costs and expenses of third parties who are parties to
an Assumed Contract or an Assumed Capital Lease in
connection with the assignment and assumption of the
Assumed Contracts and Assumed Capital Leases in
connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein (but, in all cases other than with
respect to the assignment and assumption of the
Citicorp Lease, only to the extent such Assumed

PROMISSORY NOTE

$2,000,000
PENNSAUKEN, NEW JERSEY

September 30, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, PRN HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation ('Maker'),
hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of KCI THERAPEUTIC SERVICES,
INC., a Delaware corporation ('Payee'), as hereinafter provided, the principal
amount of TWO MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($2,000,000), together with interest on
the unpaid principal balance from time to time outstanding at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum beginning on March 31, 1996 (the 'Interest Start Date').
All past due principal hereof and accrued unpaid interest thereon shall bear
interest from the maturity thereof until paid at the lesser of the Default Rate
(as hereinafter defined) and the maximum rate of interest per annum permitted by
applicable law. Prior to the Interest Start Date no interest shall accrue on
those portions of the outstanding principal balance hereof which are not then
past due. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366 day calendar
year, as the case may be.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings indicated below:

'Default Rate' shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from day to
day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

'Prime Rate' shall mean the rate of interest per annum established from
time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in San
Francisco, California ('BOA'), and designated as its reference rate of interest,
which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by BOA. In the
event that BOA does not have a rate designated by it as its reference rate, then
the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to be the variable rate of
interest per annum which is the rate designated by BOA as its 'prime rate',
'base rate' or other similar rate and that Payee determines to be comparable to
the Prime Rate as described above. In the event that BOA shall cease to announce
any of the rates described in the preceding sentence, then the Prime Rate shall
be calculated using that variable rate of interest per annum established by
NationsBank of Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such other financial
institution satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be chosen by Payee, in
its sole discretion, and changed by Payee, in its sole discretion exercised in
good faith, from time to time, any such change to become effective on the date
of such change.

This Note shall be repaid as follows:

(a) Interest, calculated on a daily basis, shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears commencing on the 30th day of September, 1996, and
thereafter continuing regularly and quarterly on the same day of each
December, March, June, and September until September 30, 1999 (the
'Maturity Date').

(b) The outstanding principal balance hereof and any and all accrued
but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in full on the
Maturity Date or upon earlier maturity hereof, whether by acceleration or
otherwise.

Payments of principal and interest shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available funds or cash
or bank cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78230 or at
such other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset against the
last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any and all
payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I,
Inc. ('PRN-I') pursuant to Section 11.1 of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement
(the 'Asset Purchase Agreement') dated August 23, 1994, as amended by Amendment
No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of September 30, 1994, by and among
MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware
<PAGE>
corporation ('MEDIQ'), PRN-I, Maker, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ('KCI') and Payee.
Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment of all or any
portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection in the
customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment hereunder or
diminish any rights of Payee except to the extent that actual cash proceeds of
such instrument are unconditionally received by Payee.

Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without premium
or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to accrued but
unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may be entitled
to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and, lastly, to principal
due hereunder. Maker shall be required to prepay this Note in whole or in part
to the full extent of any Prepayment Offering Proceeds (as defined herein) which
may be realized from time to time from any Subsidiary Equity Offering (as
hereinafter defined) or any MEDIQ Equity Offering (as hereinafter defined). For
purposes hereof, 'Prepayment Offering Proceeds' shall mean (i) with respect to a
Subsidiary Equity Offering, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net
Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) equal to or less than $20,000,000, or (ii)
with respect to a MEDIQ Equity Offering, an amount equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds
equal to or less than $20,000,000, by (y) a fraction having a numerator equal to
the total pro-forma combined gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of the Subsidiaries (as defined herein) on a consolidated basis and a
denominator equal to the sum of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for
the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a)
the sum of the products derived by multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated
gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the
Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily average percentage of capital stock directly or
indirectly owned by MEDIQ in the respective Subsidiary over the same period,
plus (b) the sum of the products of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues
for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each company in which, at any time
during the relevant period, twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock of
such company was directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the daily
average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in
such company during the relevant period, all as determined using generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied ('GAAP'), other than
principles of consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Note to
the contrary, if, in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if the fraction
derived from the calculation described in clause (y) above is less than 1/2, no
mandatory prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment will be due
five (5) business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by
the party entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, 'Net Proceeds' shall mean an
amount equal to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any and all
Subsidiary Equity Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after the date
hereof, minus (x) any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions and other
reasonable and customary fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
offerings, (y) any success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation in
connection with such offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent (.5%)
of the gross proceeds resulting from such offerings, and (z) any unpaid portion
of any closing fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to exceed
$75,000 in the aggregate. For purposes hereof, a 'Subsidiary Equity Offering'
shall mean a primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity Securities (as
defined herein) of any of the Subsidiaries for cash. A 'MEDIQ Equity Offering'
shall mean a primary offering and sale of Equity Securities of MEDIQ for cash.
For purposes hereof 'Equity Securities' shall mean any (i) capital stock or
other equity interests, (ii) other right(s) with respect to any such capital
stock or other equity interests, (iii) offers, options (other than employee
stock options), obligations, warrants, rights, subscriptions, agreements, claims
of any character, or commitments of any kind (contingent or otherwise) relating
to the issuance, conversion, exchange, registration, voting, sale or transfer of
any such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv) any debenture, bond, note or
other instrument that may be converted into or exchanged for any capital stock
or other equity instrument. For purposes hereof 'Subsidiaries' or 'Subsidiary'
means Maker, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation
('PRN'), PRN-I and/or any other entity that is wholly or partially owned or
controlled by Maker. For purposes hereof an entity is 'controlled by' another
person or entity if such other person or entity is in possession, direct or
indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of, the management and
policies of the entity,

1
<PAGE>
whether by ownership, contract or otherwise. For purposes hereof 'pro-forma'
revenues for any entity means for any relevant period (a) the actual revenues of
said entity over the relevant period plus (b) the actual revenues during the
relevant period of any business acquired by the entity during the relevant
period, as accounted for in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. As
an example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the revenues of
PRN-I shall include the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that precedes
the effective time of the sale of the assets under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Any prepayment required to be made under this paragraph and the corresponding
provisions of Holdings Note 2 and Holdings Note 3 (as hereinafter defined) shall
be applied first to Holdings Note 2 and Holdings Note 3 in accordance with the
terms of Holdings Note 2 and Holdings Note 3 before being applied to this Note.

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ pursuant to the terms of that certain Guaranty
Agreement dated of even date herewith in favor of Payee (the 'Guaranty').

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder:

(a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or a default in
Maker's obligations to escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant to the
terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and such default
continues uncured for five (5) days after the date any such payment or
escrow was due; provided, however, that if in any consecutive twelve (12)
month period Maker defaults two times in making payments when due hereunder
and/or timely making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement, any such subsequent default shall immediately
constitute an Event of Default hereunder without the passage of any grace
period; (b) any other default occurs under this Note and such default
remains uncured for thirty (30) days after the delivery of notice from
Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under the Guaranty; (d) any failure by
PRN-I, Maker or MEDIQ as the case may be, to perform and carry out, each
and every of the respective agreements and undertakings of such entities as
set forth in that certain Negative Covenants Agreement (so called herein)
dated of even date herewith and entered into by and among PRN-I, Maker,
MEDIQ, KCI and Payee; (e) any failure by MEDIQ to perform and carry out
each and every of its agreements, covenants and undertakings as set forth
in that certain Collateral Transfer of Note (Security Agreement) (so called
herein) dated of even date herewith and executed by MEDIQ in favor of
Payee; (f) sale of all or substantially all of any of PRN-I's, PRN's,
Maker's or MEDIQ's assets, or any formal action in contemplation of the
dissolution, liquidation or termination of any of PRN-I's, PRN's, Maker's,
or MEDIQ's existence; (g) institution of any proceedings by or against any
of PRN-I, PRN, Maker or MEDIQ under any law relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other form of debtor relief or any of
PRN-I's, PRN's Maker's or MEDIQ's making an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, conservator or other
judicial representative for any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker or MEDIQ or any of
PRN-I's, PRN's, Maker's or MEDIQ's property, unless, in the case of any
such proceeding or appointment not instituted by any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker,
or MEDIQ, such proceeding or appointment is dismissed within sixty (60)
days; (h) the occurrence of any Change of Control (as hereinafter defined)
without the prior written consent of Payee; or (i) the failure of any
Subsidiary to make any payment when due under any indebtedness of any
Subsidiary in excess of $3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of any breach,
default or event of default under any such indebtedness that results in the
acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness.

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal balance
hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the option of
Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment, protest, demand,
notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of
non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at maturity, however
such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in the hands of an
attorney for collection, and/or if this Note is collected by suit or

2
<PAGE>
through bankruptcy, or other legal proceedings, the Maker agrees to pay all
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses incurred by Payee in
connection with such collection efforts.

Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the terms and provisions of the
Subordination and Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress Financial
Corporation, Maker and Payee dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict performance of
Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall constitute a
waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver of any of
Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver of any
default or any instance of non-compliance shall be limited to its express terms
and shall not extend to any other default or instance of non-compliance.

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be sent either by (a) personal delivery service with charges
therefor billed to shipper, (b) expedited delivery service with charges therefor
billed to shipper, (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) prepaid telegram or telex
(provided that the contents of such telegram or telex are confirmed by expedited
delivery service or by mail in the manner previously described) addressed to
Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in the Asset
Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may have
designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that
such delivery is confirmed by the courier delivery service), (ii) on the date of
deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody
of the United States Postal Service, if sent by United States Mail, or (iii) on
the date of delivery to any expedited delivery service.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the term 'Payee'
shall mean the party so defined as Payee in the first paragraph of this Note for
so long as such party is the holder of this Note and, thereafter, shall mean, at
any time, the then holder of this Note. Maker and any and all sureties,
guarantors and endorsers of this Note and all other parties now or hereafter
liable hereon, severally waive grace, demand, presentment for payment, protest,
notice of any kind (including, but not limited to, notice of dishonor, notice of
protest, notice of intention to accelerate and notice of acceleration) and
diligence in collecting and bringing suit against any party hereto and agree (i)
to all extensions and partial payments, with or without notice, before or after
maturity, (ii) to any substitution, exchange or release of any security now or
hereafter given for this Note, (iii) to the release of any party primarily or
secondarily liable hereon, and (iv) that it will not be necessary for Payee, in
order to enforce payment of this Note, to first institute or exhaust Payee's
remedies against Maker or any other party liable therefor or against any
security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the indebtedness
evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written
or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and any other charges
constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, and contracted
for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or otherwise in connection with
the debt evidenced hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum
amount of interest permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of
this Note is accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting
from a default hereunder or under any other document executed as security
herefor or in connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or
otherwise, then earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of
interest permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of
this Note shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting
interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which
would exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the
'Excess Interest'), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction
of the principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof
and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest which
exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness shall
be refunded to Maker.

3
<PAGE>
All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this Note for the use,
forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note
shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of
such indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on
account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and shall
inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns; provided
that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or interest herein
to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith (i) Maker
has delivered to Payee that certain other Promissory Note ('Holdings Note 2')
dated of even date herewith, being in the original principal amount of
$5,000,000 to Payee, (ii) Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other
Promissory Note ('Holdings Note 3'), dated of even date herewith, being in the
original principal amount of $3,000,000 to Payee, (iii) PRN has delivered to
Payee that certain Promissory Note ('Acquisition Note') in the original
principal amount of $5,835,707 and payable to the order of Payee and (iv) PRN-I
has delivered that certain Promissory Note ('$2,956,957 Note') dated of even
date herewith, in the original principal amount of $2,956,957 and being payable
to the order of Payee. Maker covenants and agrees that any Event of Default
under, or with respect to Holdings Note 2, Holdings Note 3, the Acquisition
Note, and/or the $2,956,957 Note, or under any other instruments relating
thereto, shall also constitute an Event of Default hereunder, entitling Payee to
pursue all rights, remedies and recourses available to it, including
acceleration of this Note and foreclosure of any liens securing repayment
hereof.

This Note shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with, and all
issues relating to this Note or to the transaction which this Note relates
(including, without limitation, the validity and/or enforceability of this Note
or any portion of this Note) shall be governed by, the laws of the State of
Delaware (other than the conflict of law rules of the State of Delaware), except
as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable law and except to
the extent that remedies provided by the laws of any state other than Delaware
are governed by the laws of said state.

average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in
such company during the relevant period, all as determined using generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied ('GAAP'), other than

derived from the calculation described in clause (y) above is less than 1/2, no
mandatory prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment will be due
five (5) business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by

means for any relevant period (a) the actual revenues of said entity over the
relevant period plus (b) the actual revenues during the relevant period of any
business acquired by the entity during the relevant period, as accounted for in
accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. As an example and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the revenues of PRN-I shall include
the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that precedes the effective
time of the sale of the assets under the Asset Purchase Agreement. A prepayment
required to be made under this paragraph and the corresponding provisions of

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ pursuant to the terms of that certain Guaranty
Agreement dated of even date herewith in favor of Payee (the 'Guaranty').

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder: (a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or a default
in Maker's obligations to escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant to the
terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and such default
continues uncured for five (5) days after the date any such payment or escrow
was due; provided, however, that if in any consecutive twelve (12) month period
Maker defaults two times in making payments when due hereunder and/or timely
making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement,
any such subsequent default shall immediately constitute an Event of Default
hereunder without the passage of any grace period; (b) any other default occurs
under this Note and such default remains uncured for thirty (30) days after the
delivery of notice from Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under the Guaranty;

substantially all of any of PRN-I's, PRN's, Maker's or MEDIQ's assets, or any

benefit of creditors, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, conservator or
other judicial representative for any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker or MEDIQ or any of
PRN-I's, PRN's, Maker's or MEDIQ's property, unless, in the case of any such
proceeding or appointment not instituted by any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker, or MEDIQ,
such proceeding or appointment is dismissed within sixty (60) days; (h) the
occurrence of any Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) without the prior
written consent of Payee; or (i) the failure of any Subsidiary to make any
payment when due under any indebtedness of any Subsidiary in excess of
$3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of any breach, default or event of default under
any such indebtedness that results in the acceleration of the maturity of any
such indebtedness.

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal balance
hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the option of
Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment, protest, demand,
notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of
non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at maturity, however
such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in the hands of an
attorney for collection, and/or if this Note is collected by suit or through
bankruptcy, or other legal proceedings, the Maker agrees to pay all reasonable
attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses incurred by Payee in connection
with such collection efforts. Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the
terms and provisions of the Subordination and Standstill

2
<PAGE>
Agreement executed by and among Congress Financial Corporation, Maker and Payee
dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict performance of
Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall constitute a
waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver of any of
Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver of any
default or any instance of non-compliance shall be limited to its express terms
and shall not extend to any other default or instance of non-compliance.

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be sent either by (a) personal delivery service with charges
therefor billed to shipper, (b) expedited delivery service with charges therefor
billed to shipper, (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) prepaid telegram or telex
(provided that the contents of such telegram or telex are confirmed by expedited
delivery service or by mail in the manner previously described) addressed to
Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in the Asset
Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may have
designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that
such delivery is confirmed by the courier delivery service), (ii) on the date of
deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody
of the United States Postal Service, if sent by United States Mail, or (iii) on
the date of delivery to any expedited delivery service.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the term 'Payee'
shall mean the party so defined as Payee in the first paragraph of this Note for
so long as such party is the holder of this Note and, thereafter, shall mean, at
any time, the then holder of this Note.

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this Note and
all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive grace, demand,
presentment for payment, protest, notice of any kind (including, but not limited
to, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, notice of intention to accelerate and
notice of acceleration) and diligence in collecting and bringing suit against
any party hereto and agree (i) to all extensions and partial payments, with or
without notice, before or after maturity, (ii) to any substitution, exchange or
release of any security now or hereafter given for this Note, (iii) to the
release of any party primarily or secondarily liable hereon, and (iv) that it
will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce payment of this Note, to
first institute or exhaust Payee's remedies against Maker or any other party
liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the indebtedness
evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written
or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and any other charges
constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, and contracted
for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or otherwise in connection with
the debt evidenced hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum
amount of interest permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of
this Note is accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting
from a default hereunder or under any other document executed as security
herefor or in connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or
otherwise, then earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of
interest permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of
this Note shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting
interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which
would exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the
'Excess Interest'), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction
of the principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof
and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest which
exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness shall
be refunded to Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this
Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of Maker to the
holder of this Note shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread

3
<PAGE>
throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the
actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout
the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and shall
inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns; provided
that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or interest herein
to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith (i) Maker
has delivered to Payee that certain other Promissory Note ('Holdings Note 2')
dated of even date herewith, being in the original principal amount of
$5,000,000 to Payee, (ii) Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other
Promissory Note ('Holdings Note 3'), dated of even date herewith, being in the
original principal amount of $2,000,000 to Payee, (iii) PRN has delivered to

principal amount of $5,835,707 and payable to the order of Payee and (iv) PRN-I
has delivered that certain Promissory Note ('$2,956,957 Note') dated of even
date herewith, in the original principal amount of $2,956,957 and being payable

under, or with respect to Holdings Note 2, Holdings Note 3, the Acquisition
Note, and/or the $2,956,957 Note, or under any other instruments relating
thereto, shall also constitute an Event of Default hereunder, entitling Payee to
pursue all rights, remedies and recourses available to it, including
acceleration of this Note and foreclosure of any liens securing repayment
hereof.

This Note shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with, and all
issues relating to this Note or to the transaction which this Note relates
(including, without limitation, the validity and/or enforceability of this Note
or any portion of this Note) shall be governed by, the laws of the State of

PROMISSORY NOTE
$5,000,000

Pennsauken, New Jersey
September 30, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, PRN HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation ('Maker'),
hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of KCI THERAPEUTIC SERVICES,
INC., a Delaware corporation ('Payee'), as hereinafter provided, the principal
amount of FIVE MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($5,000,000), together with interest
on the unpaid principal balance from time to time outstanding at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum beginning on March 31, 1996 (the 'Interest Start Date').
All past due principal hereof and accrued unpaid interest thereon shall bear
interest from the maturity thereof until paid at the lesser of the Default Rate
(as hereinafter defined) and the maximum rate of interest per annum permitted by
applicable law. Prior to the Interest Start Date no interest shall accrue on
those portions of the outstanding principal balance hereof which are not then
past due. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366 day calendar
year, as the case may be.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings indicated below:

'Default Rate' shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from day to
day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

'Prime Rate' shall mean the rate of interest per annum established from
time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in San
Francisco, California ('BOA'), and designated as its reference rate of interest,
which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by BOA. In the
event that BOA does not have a rate designated by it as its reference rate, then
the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to be the variable rate of
interest per annum which is the rate designated by BOA as its 'prime rate',
'base rate' or other similar rate and that Payee determines to be comparable to
the Prime Rate as described above. In the event that BOA shall cease to announce
any of the rates described in the preceding sentence, then the Prime Rate shall
be calculated using that variable rate of interest per annum established by
NationsBank of Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such other financial
institution satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be chosen by Payee, in
its sole discretion, and changed by Payee, in its sole discretion exercised in
good faith, from time to time, any such change to become effective on the date
of such change.

This Note shall be repaid as follows:

(a) Interest, calculated on a daily basis, shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears commencing on the 30th day of September, 1996, and
thereafter continuing regularly and quarterly on the last day of each
December, March, June, and September until September 30, 1999 (the
'Maturity Date').

(b) The outstanding principal balance hereof and any and all accrued
but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in full on the
Maturity Date or upon earlier maturity hereof, whether by acceleration or
otherwise.

Payments of principal and interest shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available funds or cash
or bank cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78230 or at
such other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset against the
last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any and all
payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I,
Inc. ('PRN-I') pursuant to Section 11.1 of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement
(the 'Asset Purchase Agreement') dated August 23, 1994, as amended by Amendment
No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of September 30, 1994, by and among
MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ('MEDIQ'), PRN-I, Maker, Kinetic
Concepts, Inc. ('KCI') and Payee.
<PAGE>
Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment of all
or any portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection in the
customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment hereunder or
diminish any rights of Payee except to the extent that actual cash proceeds of
such instrument are unconditionally received by Payee.

Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without premium
or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to accrued but
unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may be entitled
to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and, lastly, to principal
due hereunder. Maker shall be required to prepay this Note in whole or in part
to the full extent of any Prepayment Offering Proceeds (as defined herein) which
may be realized from time to time from any Subsidiary Equity Offering (as
hereinafter defined) or any MEDIQ Equity Offering (as hereinafter defined). For
purposes hereof, 'Prepayment Offering Proceeds' shall mean (i) with respect to a
Subsidiary Equity Offering, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net
Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) equal to or less than $20,000,000, or (ii)
with respect to a MEDIQ Equity Offering, an amount equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds
equal to or less than $20,000,000, by (y) a fraction having a numerator equal to
the total pro-forma combined gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of the Subsidiaries (as defined herein) on a consolidated basis and a
denominator equal to the sum of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for
the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a)
the sum of the products derived by multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated
gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the
Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily average percentage of capital stock directly or
indirectly owned by MEDIQ in the respective Subsidiary over the same period,
plus (b) the sum of the products of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues
for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each company in which, at any time
during the relevant period, twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock of
such company was directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the daily
average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in
such company during the relevant period, all as determined using generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied ('GAAP'), other than
principles of consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Note to
the contrary, if, in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if the fraction
derived from the calculation described in clause (y) above is less than 1/2, no
mandatory prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment will be due
five (5) business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by
the party entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, 'Net Proceeds' shall mean an
amount equal to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any and all
Subsidiary Equity Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after the date
hereof, minus (x) any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions and other
reasonable and customary fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
offerings, (y) any success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation in
connection with such offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent (.5%)
of the gross proceeds resulting from such offerings, and (z) any unpaid portion
of any closing fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to exceed

shall mean a primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity Securities (as
defined herein) of any of the Subsidiaries for cash. A 'MEDIQ Equity Offering'
shall mean a primary offering and sale of Equity Securities of MEDIQ for cash.
For purposes hereof 'Equity Securities' shall mean any (i) capital stock or
other equity interests, (ii) other right(s) with respect to any such capital
stock or other equity interests, (iii) offers, options (other than employee
stock options), obligations, warrants, rights, subscriptions, agreements, claims
of any character, or commitments of any kind (contingent or otherwise) relating
to the issuance, conversion, exchange, registration, voting, sale or transfer of
any such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv) any debenture, bond, note or
other instrument that may be converted into or exchanged for any capital stock
or other equity instrument. For purposes hereof 'Subsidiaries' or 'Subsidiary'
means Maker, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation
('PRN'), PRN-I and/or any other entity that is wholly or partially owned or
controlled by Maker. For purposes hereof an entity is 'controlled by' another
person or entity if such other person or entity is in possession, direct or
indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of, the management and
policies of the entity, whether by ownership, contract or otherwise. For
purposes hereof 'pro-forma' revenues for any entity

1
<PAGE>
means for any relevant period (a) the actual revenues of said entity over the
relevant period plus (b) the actual revenues during the relevant period of any
business acquired by the entity during the relevant period, as accounted for in
accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. As an example and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the revenues of PRN-I shall include
the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that precedes the effective
time of the sale of the assets under the Asset Purchase Agreement.

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ pursuant to the terms of that certain Guaranty

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder: (a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or a default
in Maker's obligations to escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant to the
terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and such default
continues uncured for five (5) days after the date any such payment or escrow
was due; provided, however, that if in any consecutive twelve (12) month period
Maker defaults two times in making payments when due hereunder and/or timely
making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement,
any such subsequent default shall immediately constitute an Event of Default
hereunder without the passage of any grace period; (b) any other default occurs
under this Note and such default remains uncured for thirty (30) days after the
delivery of notice from Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under the Guaranty;
(d) any failure by PRN-I, Maker or MEDIQ as the case may be, to perform and
carry out, each and every of the respective agreements and undertakings of such
entities as set forth in that certain Negative Covenants Agreement (so called
herein) dated of even date herewith and entered into by and among PRN-I, Maker,
MEDIQ, KCI and Payee; (e) any failure by MEDIQ to perform and carry out each and

even date herewith and executed by MEDIQ in favor of Payee; (f) sale of all or
substantially all of any of PRN-I's, PRN's, Maker's or MEDIQ's assets, or any
formal action in contemplation of the dissolution, liquidation or termination of

proceedings by or against any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker or MEDIQ under any law
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other form of debtor

benefit of creditors, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, conservator or
other judicial representative for any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker or MEDIQ or any of
PRN-I's, PRN's, Maker's or MEDIQ's property, unless, in the case of any such
proceeding or appointment not instituted by any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker, or MEDIQ,
such proceeding or appointment is dismissed within sixty (60) days; (h) the
occurrence of any Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) without the prior
written consent of Payee; or (i) the failure of any Subsidiary to make any
payment when due under any indebtedness of any Subsidiary in excess of
$3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of any breach, default or event of default under
any such indebtedness that results in the acceleration of the maturity of any
such indebtedness.

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal balance
hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the option of
Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment, protest, demand,
notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of
non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at maturity, however
such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in the hands of an
attorney for collection, and/or if this Note is collected by suit or through
bankruptcy, or other legal proceedings, the Maker agrees to pay all reasonable
attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses incurred by Payee in connection
with such collection efforts.

Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the terms and provisions of the
Subordination and Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress Financial
Corporation, Maker and Payee dated of even date herewith. No failure or delay on
the part of Payee to insist on strict performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall constitute a waiver of Payee's rights
in that or any other instance. No waiver of any of Payee's rights shall be
effective unless in writing, and

communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that
such delivery is confirmed by the courier delivery service), (ii) on the date of
deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody
of the United States Postal Service, if sent by United States Mail, or (iii) on
the date of delivery to any expedited delivery service.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the term 'Payee'
shall mean the party so defined as Payee in the first paragraph of this Note for
so long as such party is the holder of this Note and, thereafter, shall mean, at
any time, the then holder of this Note.

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this Note and
all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive grace, demand,
presentment for payment, protest, notice of any kind (including, but not limited
to, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, notice of intention to accelerate and
notice of acceleration) and diligence in collecting and bringing suit against
any party hereto and agree (i) to all extensions and partial payments, with or
without notice, before or after maturity, (ii) to any substitution, exchange or
release of any security now or hereafter given for this Note, (iii) to the
release of any party primarily or secondarily liable hereon, and (iv) that it
will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce payment of this Note, to
first institute or exhaust Payee's remedies against Maker or any other party
liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the indebtedness
evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written
or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and any other charges
constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, and contracted
for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or otherwise in connection with
the debt evidenced hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum
amount of interest permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of
this Note is accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting
from a default hereunder or under any other document executed as security
herefor or in connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or
otherwise, then earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of
interest permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of
this Note shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting
interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which
would exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the
'Excess Interest'), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction
of the principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof
and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest which
exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness shall
be refunded to Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this
Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of Maker to the
holder of this Note shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the
actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout
the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
the remainder hereof.

PROMISSORY NOTE
$2,956,957.00

Pennsauken, New Jersey
September 30, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, MEDIQ/PRN LIFE SUPPORT SERVICES-I, INC., a Delaware
corporation ('Maker'), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of
KCI THERAPEUTIC SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ('Payee'), in
installments as hereinafter provided, the principal amount of TWO MILLION NINE
HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN AND NO/100 DOLLARS
($2,956,957), together with interest from the date hereof on the principal
amount from time to time remaining unpaid, at the lesser of the rate of eight
percent (8%) per annum and the maximum rate of interest per annum permitted by
applicable law. All past due principal hereof and accrued unpaid interest
thereon shall bear interest from the maturity thereof until paid at the lesser
of the Default Rate (hereinafter defined) and the maximum rate of interest per
annum permitted by applicable law. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of
a 365 or 366 day calendar year, as the case may be.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings indicated below:

'Default Rate' shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from day
to day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

'Prime Rate' shall mean the rate of interest per annum established
from time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association
in San Francisco, California ('BOA'), and designated as its reference rate
of interest, which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged
by BOA. In the event that BOA does not announce a rate designated by it as
its reference lending rate, then the Prime Rate under this Note shall be
deemed to be the variable rate of interest per annum which is the general
reference rate designated by BOA as its 'prime rate', 'base rate' or other
similar rate and which Payee determines to be comparable to the Prime Rate
as described above. In the event that BOA shall cease to have any of the
rates described in the preceding sentence, then the Prime Rate shall be
calculated using that variable rate of interest per annum established by
Nations Bank of Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such other financial
institution satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be chosen by
Payee, or any subsequent holder hereof, in its sole discretion and changed
by Payee, or any subsequent holder hereof, in its sole discretion exercised
in good faith, from time to time, any such change to become effective on
the date of such change.

The principal amount hereof shall be repaid in equal monthly installments
of principal and interest of $310,748.17 with the first such monthly installment
being due and payable on December 31, 1994 and continuing regularly and monthly
on the last day of each successive calendar month thereafter until September 30,
1995 (the 'Maturity Date'), on which date the entire outstanding unpaid
principal balance hereof, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
shall be due and payable.

Payments of principal and interest, shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available funds or cash
or bank cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78230 or at
such other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset against the
last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any and all
payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to Maker pursuant to Section 11.1 of
that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the 'Asset Purchase Agreement') dated
August 23, 1994, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement dated
as of September 30, 1994, by and among MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation ('MEDIQ'), Maker, PRN Holdings, Inc. ('Holdings'), Kinetic Concepts,
Inc. ('KCI') and Payee.

Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment of all
or any portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection in the
customary manner, but the same shall not
<PAGE>
constitute payment hereunder or diminish any rights of Payee except to the
extent that actual cash proceeds of such instrument are unconditionally received
by Payee.

Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without premium
or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to accrued but
unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may be entitled
to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and lastly, to
installments of principal due hereunder in the inverse order of their maturity.
Subject to the subordination contained herein, Maker shall be required to prepay
this Note in whole or in part to the full extent of any Prepayment Offering
Proceeds (as hereinafter defined ) which may be realized from time to time from
any Subsidiary Equity Offering as defined herein) or any MEDIQ Equity Offering
(as hereinafter defined). For purposes hereof 'Prepayment Offering Proceeds'
shall mean (i) with respect to a Subsidiary Equity Offering, an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) equal to or
less than $20,000,000 or (ii) with respect to a MEDIQ Equity Offering, an amount
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds equal to or less than $20,000,000 by (y) a
fraction having a numerator equal to the total pro forma combined gross revenues
for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of the Subsidiaries (as defined
herein) on a consolidated basis and a denominator equal to the sum of the
pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a) the sum of the products
derived by multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the
previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily
average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in the
respective Subsidiary over the same period, plus (b) the sum of the products of
the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of each company in which, at any time during the relevant period,
twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock of such company was directly
or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the daily average percentage of
capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in such company during the
relevant period, all as determined using generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied ('GAAP'), other than principles of
consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Note to the contrary,
if, in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if the fraction derived from
the calculation described in clause (y) above is less than 1/2, no mandatory
prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment will be due five (5)
business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by the party
entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, 'Net Proceeds' shall mean an amount equal
to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any and all Subsidiary Equity
Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after the date hereof, minus (x)
any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions and other reasonable and
customary fees and expenses incurred in connection with such offerings, (y) any
success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation in connection with such
offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent (.5%) of the gross proceeds
resulting from such offerings, and (z) any unpaid portion of any closing fee
paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to exceed $75,0000 in the
aggregate. For purposes hereof, a 'Subsidiary Equity Offering' shall mean a
primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity Securities (as defined herein)

primary offering and sale of Equity Securities of MEDIQ for cash. For purposes
hereof 'Equity Securities' shall mean any (i) capital stock or other equity
interests, (ii) other right(s) with respect to any such capital stock or other
equity interests, (iii) offers, options (other than employee stock options),
obligations, warrants, rights, subscriptions, agreements, claims of any
character, or commitments of any kind (contingent or otherwise) relating to the
issuance, conversion, exchange, registration, voting, sale or transfer of any
such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv) any debenture, bond, note or
other instrument that may be converted into or exchanged for any capital stock
or other equity instrument. For purposes hereof 'Subsidiaries' or 'Subsidiary'
means Holdings, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation
('PRN'), Maker, and/or any other entity that is wholly or partially owned or
controlled by Holdings. For purposes hereof an entity is 'controlled by' another
person or entity if such other person or entity is in possession, direct or
indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of, the management and
policies of the entity, whether by ownership, contract or otherwise. For
purposes hereof 'pro-forma' revenues for any entity means for any relevant
period (a) the actual revenues of said entity over the relevant period plus (b)
the

1
<PAGE>
actual revenues during the relevant period of any business acquired by the
entity during the relevant period, as accounted for in accordance with GAAP and
Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act of 1933. As an example and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the revenues of Maker shall include the revenues of Payee from the
Division (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) for that portion of the
relevant period that precedes the effective time of the sale of the assets under
the Asset Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the mandatory prepayment provisions set forth herein are and shall at
all times be subordinate to the repayment of the Holdings Notes (each as
hereinafter defined) and Maker shall have no obligation to make any mandatory
prepayments to the extent, but only to the extent, that there remains any unpaid
principal and/or interest under the Holdings Notes at the time any Prepayment
Offering Proceeds are realized by the party entitled to such proceeds; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply in the event that at the time any
Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized payment of the Holdings Notes is
prohibited or restricted.

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ and Holdings pursuant to the terms of two (2)
certain Guaranty Agreements dated of even date herewith, in favor of Payee and
executed by MEDIQ and Holdings, respectively, (respectively, the 'MEDIQ
Guaranty' and the 'Holdings Guaranty').

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder: (a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or a default
in Maker's obligations to escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant to the
terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and such default
continues uncured for five (5) days after the date any such payment or escrow
was due; provided, however, that if in any consecutive twelve (12) month period
Maker defaults two times in making payments when due hereunder and/or timely
making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement,
any such subsequent default shall immediately constitute an Event of Default
hereunder without the passage of any grace period; (b) any other default occurs
under this Note and such default remains uncured for thirty (30) days after the
delivery of notice from Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under the MEDIQ

proceedings by or against any of Maker, Holdings, PRN or MEDIQ under any law

or other judicial representative for any of Maker, Holdings, PRN or MEDIQ or any
of Maker's, Holdings', PRN's or MEDIQ's property, unless, in the case of any
such proceeding or appointment not instituted by any of Maker, Holdings, PRN or
MEDIQ, such proceeding or appointment is dismissed within sixty (60) days, (h)
the occurrence of any Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) without the
prior written consent of Payee; or (i) the failure of any Subsidiary to make any
payment when due under any indebtedness of any Subsidiary in excess of
$3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of any breach, default or event of default under
any such indebtedness that results in the acceleration of the maturity of any
such indebtedness; or (j) if at any time during the term of this Note the amount
equal to the sum of the Tangible Equity of MEDIQ plus the debt of MEDIQ, on an
unconsolidated basis, that is subordinate in right of payment to the MEDIQ
Guaranty is less than $50,000,000 (for purposes of the foregoing the Tangible
Equity (hereinafter defined) of MEDIQ means an amount equal to the difference
between the shareholders' equity in MEDIQ and the goodwill (net of amortization)
of MEDIQ other than goodwill arising from the transactions contemplated by the
Asset Purchase

2
<PAGE>
Agreement, all as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied).

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal balance
hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the option of
Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment, protest, demand,
notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of
non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at maturity, however
such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in the hands of an

connection with such collection efforts.

Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the terms and provisions of the
Subordination and Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress Financial
Corporation, Maker and Payee dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict performance of
Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall constitute a
waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver of any of
Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver of any
default or any instance of non-compliance shall be limited to its express terms
and shall not extend to any other default or instance of non-compliance.

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in

Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in the Asset
Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may have
designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this Note and
all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive grace, demand,

to, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, notice of intention to accelerate and
notice of acceleration) and diligence in collecting and bringing suit against
any party hereto and agree (i) to all extensions and partial payments, with or
without notice, before or after maturity, (ii) to any substitution, exchange or
release of any security now or hereafter given for this Note, (iii) to the
release of any party primarily or secondarily liable hereon, and (iv) that it
will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce payment of this Note, to
first institute or exhaust Payee's remedies against Maker or any other party
liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the indebtedness
evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written
or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and any other charges
constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, and contracted
for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or otherwise in connection with
the debt evidenced hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum
amount of interest permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of
this Note is accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting
from a

3
<PAGE>
default hereunder or under any other document executed as security herefor or in
connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or otherwise, then
earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of interest
permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of this Note
shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting interest, or
adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which would exceed
the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the 'Excess
Interest'), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof
and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest which
exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness shall
be refunded to Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this
Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of Maker to the
holder of this Note shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the
actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout
the term thereof. Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable for any reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality
or enforceability of the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and shall
inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns; provided
that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or interest herein
to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith (i)
Holdings has delivered those three (3) certain Promissory Notes (collectively
the 'Holdings Notes'), each dated of even date herewith, one in the original
principal amount of $5,000,000.00, the second in the original principal amount

certain Promissory Note (the '$5,835,707 Note') dated of even date herewith,
being in the original principal amount of $5,835,707 and payable to the order of
Payee. Maker covenants and agrees that any Event of Default under or with
respect to the $5,835,707 Note and/or any or all of the Holdings Notes, or under
any other instruments relating thereto, shall also constitute an Event of
Default hereunder, entitling Payee to pursue all rights, remedies and recourses
available to it, including, without limitation, acceleration of this Note and
foreclosure of any liens securing repayment hereof.

This Note shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with, and all
issues relating to this Note or to the transaction which this Note relates
(including, without limitation, the validity and/or enforceability of this Note
or any portion of this Note) shall be governed by, the laws of the State of
Delaware (other than the conflict of law rules of the State of Delaware), except
as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable law and except to

are governed by the laws of said state.

PROMISSORY NOTE
$5,835,707.00

Pennsauken, New Jersey
September 30, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, MEDIQ/PRN LIFE SUPPORT SERVICES, INC., a Delaware
corporation ('Maker'), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of
KCI THERAPEUTIC SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ('Payee'), in
installments as hereinafter provided, the principal amount of FIVE MILLION EIGHT
HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN AND NO/100 DOLLARS
($5,835,707). All past due principal hereof shall bear interest from the
maturity thereof until paid at the lesser of the Default Rate (hereinafter
defined) and the maximum rate of interest per annum permitted by applicable law.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings indicated below:

'Default Rate' shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from day to
day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

'Prime Rate' shall mean the rate of interest per annum established from
time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in San
Francisco, California ('BOA'), and designated as its reference lending rate of
interest, which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by BOA.
In the event that BOA does not announce a rate designated by it as its reference
rate, then the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to be the variable
rate of interest per annum which is the general reference rate designated by BOA
as its 'prime rate', 'base rate' or other similar rate and which Payee or any
subsequent holder hereof determines to be comparable to the Prime Rate as
described above. In the event that BOA shall cease to have any of the rates
described in the preceding sentence, then the Prime Rate shall be calculated
using that variable rate of interest per annum established by NationsBank of
Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such other financial institution
satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be chosen by Payee, or any
subsequent holder hereof, in its sole discretion and changed by Payee, or any
subsequent holder hereof, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, from
time to time, any such change to become effective on the date of such change.

The principal amount hereof shall be repaid in ten (10) equal monthly
installments of $583,570.70, with the first such monthly installment being due
and payable on December 31, 1994 and continuing regularly and monthly thereafter
on the last day of each successive calendar month until September 30, 1995 (the
'Maturity Date') on which date the entire outstanding unpaid principal balance
and interest hereof shall be due and payable.

Payments of principal and interest, if applicable, shall be made in lawful
money of the United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available
funds or cash or bank cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas
78230 or at such other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset against the
last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any and all
payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ('PRN-I') pursuant to Section 11.1 of that certain
Asset Purchase Agreement (the 'Asset Purchase Agreement') dated August 23, 1994,
as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of September
30, 1994, by and among MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ('MEDIQ'),
PRN-I, PRN Holdings, Inc. ('Holdings') (Maker, MEDIQ, Holdings, and PRN-I are
sometimes collectively referred to herein as the 'MEDIQ Group'), Kinetic
Concepts, Inc. ('KCI') and Payee.

Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment of all
or any portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection in the
customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment hereunder or
diminish any rights of Payee except to the extent that actual cash proceeds of
such instrument are unconditionally received by Payee.
<PAGE>
Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without premium
or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to accrued but
unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may be entitled
to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and lastly, to
installments of principal due hereunder in the inverse order of their maturity.
Subject to the subordination contained herein, Maker shall be required to prepay
this Note in whole or in part to the full extent of any Prepayment Offering
Proceeds (as defined herein) which may be realized from time to time from any
Subsidiary Equity Offering (as hereinafter defined) or any MEDIQ Equity Offering
(as hereinafter defined). For purposes hereof 'Prepayment Offering Proceeds'
shall mean (i) with respect to a Subsidiary Equity Offering, an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) equal to or
less than $20,000,000, or (ii) with respect to a MEDIQ Equity Offering, an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds equal to or less than $20,000,000, by (y) a
fraction having a numerator equal to the total pro-forma combined gross revenues
for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of the Subsidiaries (as defined
herein) on a consolidated basis and a denominator equal to the sum of the
pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a) the sum of the products
derived by multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the
previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily
average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in the
respective Subsidiary over the same period, plus (b) the sum of the products of
the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of each company in which, at any time during the relevant period,
twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock of such company was directly
or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the daily average percentage of
capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in such company during the
relevant period, all as determined using generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied ('GAAP'), other than principles of
consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Note to the contrary,
in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if the fraction derived from the
calculation described in clause (y) above is less than 1/2, no mandatory
prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment will be due five (5)
business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by the party
entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, 'Net Proceeds' shall mean an amount equal
to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any and all Subsidiary Equity
Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after the date hereof, minus (x)
any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions and other reasonable and
customary fees and expenses incurred in connection with such offerings, (y) any
success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation in connection with such
offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent (.5%) of the gross proceeds
resulting from such offerings, and (z) any unpaid portion of any closing fee
paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to exceed $75,000 in the
aggregate. For purposes hereof, a 'Subsidiary Equity Offering' shall mean a
primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity Securities (as defined herein)
of any of the Subsidiaries for cash. A 'MEDIQ Equity Offering' shall mean a
primary offering and sale of Equity Securities of MEDIQ for cash. For purposes
hereof 'Equity Securities' shall mean any (i) capital stock or other equity
interests, (ii) other right(s) with respect to any such capital stock or other
equity interests, (iii) offers, options (other than employee stock options),
obligations, warrants, rights, subscriptions, agreements, claims of any
character, or commitments of any kind (contingent or otherwise) relating to the
issuance, conversion, exchange, registration, voting, sale or transfer of any
such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv) any debenture, bond, note or
other instrument that may be converted into or exchanged for any capital stock
or other equity instrument. For purposes hereof 'Subsidiaries' or 'Subsidiary'
means Holdings, PRN-I, Maker, and/or any other entity that is wholly or
partially owned or controlled by Holdings. For purposes hereof an entity is
'controlled by' another person or entity if such other person or entity is in
possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction
of, the management and policies of the entity, whether by ownership, contract or
otherwise. For purposes hereof 'pro-forma' revenues for any entity means for any
relevant period (a) the actual revenues of said entity over the relevant period
plus (b) the actual revenues during the relevant period of any business acquired
by the entity during the relevant period, as accounted for in accordance with
GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Securities Act of 1933. As an example and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the revenues of Maker

1
<PAGE>
shall include the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that precedes the
effective time of the sale of the assets under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the mandatory
prepayment provisions set forth herein are and shall at all times be subordinate
to the repayment of the Holdings Notes and the $2,956,957 Note (each as
hereinafter defined) and Maker shall have no obligation to make any mandatory
prepayments to the extent, but only to the extent, that there remains any unpaid
principal and/or interest under the Holdings Notes or the $2,956,957 Note at the
time any Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by the party entitled to such
proceeds; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
the Holdings Notes in the event that at the time any Prepayment Offering
Proceeds are realized payment of the Holdings Notes is prohibited or restricted.

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ and Holdings pursuant to the terms of those two
(2) certain Guaranty Agreements dated of even date herewith, being in favor of
Payee and executed by MEDIQ and Holdings, respectively (respectively, the 'MEDIQ
Guaranty' and the 'Holdings Guaranty').

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder: (a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or a default
by any member of the MEDIQ Group of its respective obligations to escrow any
disputed offset amounts pursuant to the terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset
Purchase Agreement and such default continues uncured for five (5) days after
the date any such payment or escrow was due; provided, however, that if in any
consecutive twelve (12) month period Maker defaults two times in making payments
when due hereunder and/or any member or members of the MEDIQ Group defaults two
times in making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, any such subsequent default shall immediately constitute an Event of
Default hereunder without the passage of any grace period; (b) any other default
occurs under this Note and such default remains uncured for thirty (30) days
after the delivery of notice from Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under the
MEDIQ Guaranty and/or the Holdings Guaranty; (d) any failure by PRN-I, Holdings
or MEDIQ to fully perform and carry out, in any material respect, each and every

herewith and entered into by and among Holdings, MEDIQ, PRN-I, KCI and Payee;
(e) any failure by MEDIQ to perform and carry out each and every of its
agreements, covenants and undertakings as set forth in that certain Collateral
Transfer of Note (Security Agreement) (so called herein) dated of even date
herewith and executed by MEDIQ in favor of Payee; (f) sale of all or
substantially all of any of Maker's, Holdings', PRN-I's or MEDIQ's assets, or
any formal action in contemplation of the dissolution, liquidation or
termination of any of Maker's, Holdings', PRN-I's or MEDIQ's existence; (g)
institution of any proceedings by or against any of Maker, Holdings, PRN-I or
MEDIQ under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
form of debtor relief or any of Maker's, Holdings', PRN-I's or MEDIQ's making an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the appointment of a receiver,
trustee, conservator or other judicial representative for any of Maker,
Holdings, PRN-I or MEDIQ or any of Maker's, Holdings', PRN-I's or MEDIQ's
property, unless, in the case of any such proceeding or appointment not
instituted by any of Maker, Holdings, PRN-I or MEDIQ, such proceeding or
appointment is dismissed within sixty (60) days; (h) the occurrence of any
Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) without the prior written consent of
Payee; (i) the failure of any Subsidiary to make any payment when due under any
indebtedness of any Subsidiary in excess of $3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of
any breach, default or event of default under any such indebtedness that results
in the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness; or (j) if at any
time during the term of this Note the amount equal to the sum of the Tangible
Equity (hereinafter defined) of MEDIQ plus the debt of MEDIQ, on an
unconsolidated basis, that is subordinate in right of payment to the MEDIQ
Guaranty is less than $50,000,000 (for purposes of the foregoing the Tangible
Equity of MEDIQ means an amount equal to the difference between the
shareholders' equity in MEDIQ and the goodwill (net of amortization) of MEDIQ
other than goodwill arising from the transactions contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement, all as determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied).

<PAGE>
Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal balance
hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the option of
Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment, protest, demand,
notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of
non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at maturity, however
such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in the hands of an
attorney for collection, and/or if this Note is collected by suit or through
bankruptcy, probate, or other legal proceedings, the Maker agrees to pay all
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses incurred by Payee in
connection with such collection efforts.

Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the terms and provisions of the
Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress Financial Corporation, Maker
and Payee dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict performance of
Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall constitute a
waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver of any of
Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver of any
default or any instance of non-compliance shall be limited to its express terms
and shall not extend to any other default or instance of non-compliance.

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be sent either by (a) personal delivery service with charges
therefor billed to shipper, (b) expedited delivery service with charges therefor
billed to shipper, (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) prepaid telegram or telex
(provided that the contents of such telegram or telex are confirmed by expedited
delivery service or by mail in the manner previously described) addressed to
Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in the Asset
Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may have
designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that
such delivery is confirmed by the courier delivery service), (ii) on the date of
deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and custody
of the United States Postal Service, if sent by United States Mail, or (iii) on
the date of delivery to any expedited delivery service.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the term 'Payee'
shall mean the party so defined as Payee in the first paragraph of this Note for
so long as such party is the holder of this Note and, thereafter, shall mean, at
any time, the then holder of this Note.

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this Note and
all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive grace, demand,
presentment for payment, protest, notice of any kind (including, but not limited
to, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, notice of intention to accelerate and
notice of acceleration) and diligence in collecting and bringing suit against
any party hereto and agree (i) to all extensions and partial payments, with or
without notice, before or after maturity, (ii) to any substitution, exchange or
release of any security now or hereafter given for this Note, (iii) to the
release of any party primarily or secondarily liable hereon, and (iv) that it
will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce payment of this Note, to
first institute or exhaust Payee's remedies against Maker or any other party
liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the indebtedness
evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written
or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and any other charges
constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting interest, and contracted
for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or otherwise in connection with
the debt evidenced hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum
amount of interest permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of
this Note is accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting
from a default hereunder or under any other document executed as security
herefor or in connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or
otherwise, then earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of
interest permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of
this

3
<PAGE>
Note shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting interest, or
adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which would exceed
the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the 'Excess
Interest'), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof
and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest which
exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness shall
be refunded to Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this
Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of Maker to the
holder of this Note shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the
actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout
the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of
the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and shall
inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns; provided
that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or interest herein
to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith (i)
Holdings has delivered those three (3) certain Promissory Notes (collectively
the 'Holdings Notes'), each dated of even date herewith, one in the original
principal amount of $5,000,000.00, the second in the original principal amount
of $3,000,000 and the other in the original principal amount of $2,000,000.00
and each being payable to the order of Payee, and (ii) PRN-I has delivered that
certain Promissory Note (the '$2,956,957 Note') dated of even date herewith,
being in the original principal amount of $2,956,957 and payable to the order of
Payee. Maker covenants and agrees that any Event of Default under or with
respect to the $2,956,957 Note and/or any or all of the Holdings Notes, or under
any other instruments relating thereto, shall also constitute an Event of
Default hereunder, entitling Payee to pursue all rights, remedies and recourses
available to it, including, without limitation, acceleration of this Note and
foreclosure of any liens securing repayment hereof.

This Note shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with, and all
issues relating to this Note or to the transaction which this Note relates
(including, without limitation, the validity and/or enforceability of this Note
or any portion of this Note) shall be governed by, the laws of the State of
Delaware (other than the conflict of law rules of the State of Delaware), except
as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable law and except to
the extent that remedies provided by the laws of any state other than Delaware
are governed by the laws of said state.

Guaranteed Obligations. Further, it shall not be necessary for KCIT, in
order to enforce such payment by Guarantor, first to institute suit or
pursue or exhaust any rights or remedies against Borrower, PRN or others
liable on such indebtedness, or to enforce any rights against any security
that shall ever have been given to secure such indebtedness, or to join
Borrower, PRN or any others liable for the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof in any action to enforce this Guaranty, or
to resort to any other means of obtaining payment or performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

(c) Suit may be brought or demand may be made against all parties who
have signed this Guaranty or any other guaranty covering all or any part of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any one or more of them, separately
or together, without impairing the rights of KCIT against any party hereto.
At any time that KCIT is entitled to exercise its rights or remedies
hereunder, it may in its discretion elect to demand payment.

any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(iii) any release, surrender, abandonment, exchange, alteration,
sale or other disposition, subordination, deterioration, waste, failure
to protect or preserve, impairment, or loss of, or any failure to create
or perfect any lien or security interest with respect to, or any other
dealings with, any collateral or security at any time existing or
purported, believed or expected to exist in connection with any or all
of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(iv) whether express or by operation of law, any partial release of
the liability of Guarantor hereunder, or if one or more other guaranties
are now or hereafter obtained by KCIT covering all or any part of the

more of such guarantors under any such other guaranty, or any complete
or partial release of Borrower, PRN or any other party liable, directly
or indirectly, for the payment or performance of any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;

liquidation, termination, receivership, reorganization, merger,

maturity date(s) and interest rate(s)) or performance or any other terms
thereof, or any waiver, termination, or release of, or consent to
departure from, the Guaranteed Notes or any other guaranty of any or all
of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any adjustment, indulgence,
forbearance, or compromise that may be granted from time to time by KCIT
to Borrower, PRN, Guarantor, and/or any other party at any time liable
for the payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(vii) any neglect, lack of diligence, delay, omission, failure, or
refusal of KCIT to (a) take or prosecute (or in taking or prosecuting)
any action for the collection or enforcement of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or (b) foreclose or take or prosecute any action to
foreclose (or in foreclosing or taking or prosecuting any action to
foreclose) upon any security therefor, or (c) exercise (or in
exercising) any other right or power with respect to any security

assignment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or of the
Guaranteed Notes, or of any release of or change in any security or of
any other action taken or refrained from being taken by KCIT against
Borrower, PRN or any security, it being understood that KCIT shall not
be required to give Guarantor any notice of any kind under any
circumstances with respect to or in connection with the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any and all rights to notice that Guarantor may have
otherwise had being hereby waived by Guarantor;

Guarantor may at any time have against Borrower or PRN whether or not
arising in connection with this Guaranty or the Guaranteed Notes
(provided, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the assertion of
any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim); or

(xii) the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations against Borrower or PRN, whether because the Guaranteed
Obligations exceed the amount permitted by law or violate any usury law,
or because the act of creating the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part
thereof, is ultra vires, or because the officers or persons creating
same acted in excess of their authority, or because of a lack of
validity or enforceability of or defect or deficiency in the Guaranteed
Notes, or because of the subordination of, or moratorium on, payments
due and owing under the Guaranteed Notes at such times as the same would
otherwise become due and owing under the Guaranteed Notes but for such
subordination or moratorium, regardless of the party or parties,
including, without limitation, Congress Financial Corporation, intended
to be benefited by such subordination or moratorium or because
Borrower's or PRN's obligation ceases to exist by operation of law, or
because of any other reason or circumstance, it being agreed that
Guarantor shall remain liable hereon regardless of whether Borrower, PRN
or any other person be found not liable on the Guaranteed Obligations,
or any part thereof, for any reason (and regardless of any joinder of
Borrower, PRN or any other party in any action to obtain payment of any
or all of the Guaranteed Obligations); provided, however, that if any
part of the Guaranteed Obligations is not enforceable against Borrower
or PRN, as the case may be, because of the proper exercise of any right
of set-off against the Guaranteed Notes pursuant to the terms of the
Acquisition Agreement, that such part of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall not be enforceable against Guarantor.

<PAGE>
(b) In the event any payment by Borrower, PRN or any other party to
KCIT is held to constitute a preference, fraudulent transfer or other
voidable payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or if for
any other reason KCIT is required to refund such payment or pay the amount
thereof to any other party, such payment by Borrower, PRN or any other
party to KCIT shall not constitute a release of Guarantor from any
liability hereunder, and this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or
shall be reinstated (notwithstanding any prior release or discharge by KCIT
of this Guaranty or of Guarantor), as the case may be, with respect to, and
this Guaranty shall apply to, any and all amounts so refunded by KCIT or
paid by KCIT to another party, together with any interest paid by KCIT and
any attorneys' fees, costs and expenses paid or incurred by KCIT in
connection with any such event (all of which amounts shall constitute part
of the Guaranteed Obligations). It is the intent of Guarantor and KCIT that
the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor hereunder are absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and that until the Guaranteed
Obligations are fully and finally paid, and not subject to refund or
disgorgement, the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor hereunder shall
not be discharged or released, in whole or in part, by any act or
occurrence that might, but for the provisions of this Guaranty, be deemed a
legal or equitable discharge or release of a guarantor. KCIT shall be
entitled to continue to hold this Guaranty in its possession for a period
of one year from the date the Guaranteed Obligations are paid and performed
in full and for so long thereafter as may be necessary to enforce any
obligation of Guarantor hereunder and/or to exercise any right or remedy of
KCIT hereunder.

(c) If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by
Borrower and/or PRN under the Guaranteed Notes is stayed or delayed by any
law or tribunal, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by Guarantor
on demand by KCIT.

4. Other Liability. If Guarantor becomes liable for any indebtedness owing
by Borrower or PRN to KCIT other than under this Guaranty, such liability shall
not be in any manner impaired or affected hereby, and the rights of KCIT
hereunder shall be cumulative of any and all other rights that KCIT may have
against Guarantor. If Borrower or PRN is or becomes indebted to KCIT for any
indebtedness other than or in excess of the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is
liable under this Guaranty, any payment received or recovery realized upon any
indebtedness of Borrower or PRN to KCIT may, except to the extent paid by
Guarantor on the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty
or specifically required by law or agreement of KCIT to be applied to the
Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty, in KCIT's sole
discretion, be applied upon indebtedness of Borrower or PRN to KCIT other than
the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty.

5. KCIT Assigns. This Guaranty is for the benefit of KCIT and KCIT's
successors and assigns, and in the event of a permitted assignment of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, the rights and benefits hereunder,
to the extent applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations so assigned, may be
transferred with such Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor waives notice of any
transfer or assignment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, and
agrees that failure to give notice will not affect the liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder.

6. Binding Effect. This Guaranty is binding not only on Guarantor, but also
on Guarantor's successors and assigns. Words importing persons herein shall
include firms, associations, partnerships (including limited partnerships),
joint ventures, trusts, corporations and other legal entities, including public
or governmental bodies, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as natural
persons.

7. Governing Law. This Guaranty, and its validity, enforcement, and
interpretation, shall for all purposes by governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable United States
federal law, and is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the
extent permitted by, such laws. All obligations of Guarantor hereunder are
payable and performable at the place or places where the Guaranteed Obligations
are payable and performable.

8. Invalidity of Certain Provisions. If any provision of this Guaranty or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for any reason and
to any extent, be judicially declared to be invalid

4
<PAGE>
or unenforceable, neither the remaining provisions of this Guaranty nor the
application of such provision to any other Person or circumstance shall be
affected thereby, and the remaining provisions of this Guaranty, or the
applicability of such provision to other Persons or circumstances, as
applicable, shall remain in effect and be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law.

9. Attorneys' Fees and Costs of Collection. Guarantor shall pay on demand
all reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs and expenses incurred by KCIT
in the enforcement of or preservation of KCIT's rights under this Guaranty.
Guarantor agrees to pay interest on any expenses or other sums due to KCIT under
this Section 9 that are not paid when due, at a rate per annum equal to the
lesser of (i) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law, or (ii)
the Default Rate (as defined in the Guaranteed Notes). Guarantor's obligations
and liabilities under this Section 9 shall survive any payment or discharge in
full of the Guaranteed Obligations.

10. Payments. All sums payable under this Guaranty shall be paid in lawful
money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal
tender for the payment of public and private debts.

11. Controlling Agreement. It is not the intention of KCIT or Guarantor to
obligate Guarantor to pay interest in excess of that lawfully permitted to be
paid by Guarantor under applicable law. Should it be determined that any portion
of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amount payable by Guarantor under
this Guaranty constitutes interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest
that Guarantor, in Guarantor's capacity as guarantor, may lawfully be required
to pay under applicable law, the obligation of Guarantor to pay such interest
shall automatically be limited to the payment thereof in the maximum amount so
permitted under applicable law. The provisions of this Section 11 shall override
and control all other provisions of this Guaranty and of any other agreement
between Guarantor and KCIT.

12. Representations, Warranties, and Covenants of Guarantor. Guarantor
hereby represents, warrants, and covenants that (a) after giving effect to this
Guaranty, Guarantor is solvent, and does not intend to incur or believe that it
will incur debts that will be beyond its ability to pay as such debts mature;
(b) KCIT has no duty at any time to investigate or inform Guarantor of the
financial or business condition or affairs of Borrower or PRN or any change
therein, and Guarantor will keep itself fully appraised of Borrower's and PRN's
financial and business condition; (c) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that
Guarantor may be required to pay and perform the Guaranteed Obligations in full
without assistance or support from Borrower, PRN or any other party; and (d)
Guarantor has read and fully understand the provisions contained in the
Guaranteed Notes. Guarantor's representations, warranties and covenants are a
material inducement to KCIT to make the Loan and accept the Guaranteed Notes and
shall survive the execution hereof and any bankruptcy, foreclosure, transfer of
security or other event affecting Borrower, PRN, Guarantor, any other party, or
any security for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.

13. Notices. Unless specifically provided otherwise, any notice for
purposes of this Guaranty or any other document relating hereto shall be given
in writing or by telex or by facsimile (fax) transmission and shall be addressed
or delivered to the respective addresses set forth in this Guaranty, or to such
other address as may have been previously designated by the intended recipient
by notice given in accordance with this Section. If sent by prepaid, registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested), the notice shall be deemed
effective when deposited in a regularly maintained receptacle of the United
States Postal Service; if transmitted by telex, the notice shall be effective
when transmitted (answerback confirmed); and if transmitted by facsimile or
personal delivery, the notice shall be effective when received. No notice of
change of address shall be effective except upon actual receipt. This Section 13
shall not be construed in any way to affect or impair any waiver of notice or
demand provided in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document or to require
giving notice or demand to or upon any Person in any situation or for any
reason.

14. Cumulative Rights. The exercise of KCIT of any right or remedy
hereunder or under the Guaranteed Notes, or at law or in equity, shall not
preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy.
KCIT shall have all rights, remedies and recourses afforded to KCIT by

5
<PAGE>
reason of this Guaranty, the Guaranteed Notes, or by law, equity or otherwise,
and the same (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent, (b) may be pursued
separately, successively or concurrently against Guarantor or others obligated
for the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, or against any one or more
of them, or against any security or otherwise, at the sole discretion of KCIT,
(c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefor shall arise, it being agreed
by Guarantor that the exercise of, discontinuance of the exercise of or failure
to exercise any of such rights, remedies, or recourses shall in no event be
construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy, or
recourse, and (d) are intended to be, and shall be, non-exclusive. No waiver of
any default on the part of Guarantor or of any breach of any of the provisions
of this Guaranty or of any other document shall be considered a waiver of any
other or subsequent default or breach, and no delay or omission in exercising or
enforcing the rights and powers granted herein or in any other document shall be
construed as a waiver of such rights and powers, and no exercise or enforcement
of any rights or powers hereunder or under any other document shall be held to
exhaust such rights and powers, and every such right and power may be exercised
from time to time. The granting of any consent, approval or waiver by KCIT shall
be limited to the specific instance and purpose therefor and shall not
constitute consent or approval in any other instance or for any other purpose.
No notice to or demand on Guarantor in any case shall of itself entitle
Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances. No provision of this Guaranty or any right, remedy or recourse of
KCIT with respect hereto, or any default or breach, can be waived, nor can this
Guaranty or Guarantor be released or discharged in any way or to any extent,
except specifically in each case by a writing intended for that purpose (and
which refers specifically to this Guaranty) executed, and delivered to
Guarantor, by KCIT.

15. Term of Guaranty. This Guaranty shall continue in effect until all the
Guaranteed Obligations are fully and finally paid, and discharged, except that,
and notwithstanding any return of this Guaranty to Guarantor, this Guaranty
shall continue in effect (i) with respect to all obligations and liabilities of
Guarantor under Section 9 of this Guaranty, and (ii) as provided in Section 4(b)
hereof.

16. Further Assurances. Guarantor at Guarantor's expense will promptly
execute and deliver to KCIT upon KCIT's request all such other and further
documents, agreements, and instruments in compliance with or accomplishment of
the agreements of Guarantor under this Guaranty.

17. No Fiduciary Relationship. The relationship between KCIT and Guarantor
is solely that of KCIT and guarantor. KCIT has no fiduciary or other special
relationship with or duty to Guarantor and none is created hereby.

18. Interpretation. The term 'KCIT' shall be deemed to include any
permitted subsequent holder(s) of the Guaranteed Notes. Whenever the context of
any provisions hereof shall require it, words in the singular shall include the
plural, words in the plural shall include the singular, and pronouns of any
gender shall include the other genders. Captions and headings herein are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction of the document. All
references in this Guaranty to Schedules, Articles, Sections, Subsections,
paragraphs and subparagraphs refer to the respective subdivisions of this
Guaranty, unless such reference specifically identifies another document. The
terms 'herein,' 'hereof,' 'hereto,' 'hereunder' and similar terms refer to this
Guaranty and not to any particular section or subsection of this Guaranty. The
terms 'include' and 'including' shall be interpreted as if followed by the words
'without limitation. ' All references in this Guaranty to sums denominated in
dollars or with the symbol '$' refer to the lawful currency of the United States
of America, unless such reference specifically identifies another currency.

19. Time of Essence. Time shall be of the essence in this Guaranty with
respect to all of Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

20. Entire Agreement. This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement between
KCIT and Guarantor with respect to the guaranty by Guarantor of the Guaranteed
Obligations. This Guaranty supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
if any, with respect to the guaranty by Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.
No condition or conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this Guaranty
exist. This Guaranty shall be effective upon execution by Guarantor and delivery
to KCIT.

THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT is made by MEDIQ INCORPORATED, a Delaware

and payable to the order of KCIT (the '$2,956,957 Note, the $5,835,707 Note,
Holdings Note-I, Holdings Note-II, and Holdings Note-III are herein collectively
called the 'Notes'), the Notes being entitled to the benefit of a Negative
Covenants Agreement executed by Borrower, Holdings and MEDIQ in favor of KCI and
KCIT (such Negative Covenants Agreement, being herein called the 'Negative
Covenants Agreement' and the Asset Purchase Agreement being herein called the
'Acquisition Agreement'), and;

WHEREAS, KCIT has made it a condition precedent to KCIT making the Loan
available to Borrower, PRN and Holdings that Guarantor guaranty payment of the
Notes on the terms and conditions set forth in this Guaranty Agreement;

AGREEMENT:

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and as a material inducement to KCIT
to extend credit to Borrower, PRN and Holdings, Guarantor hereby guaranties to
KCIT the prompt and full payment of the Indebtedness described in Section 1
below in this Guaranty (collectively called the 'Guaranteed Obligations'), this
Guaranty being upon the following terms and conditions:

1. Guaranty of Payment. Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to KCIT the punctual payment when due, whether by lapse of time, by
acceleration of maturity, or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of all
principal, interest (including interest accruing after the commencement of any
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding by or against Borrower, PRN or Holdings as
the case may be, whether or not allowed in such proceeding), costs, expenses,
and other sums of money now or hereafter due and owing pursuant to (i) the terms
of the Notes, and (ii) all renewals, extensions, refinancings, modifications,
supplements or amendments of such indebtedness or any part thereof (the
indebtedness described in clauses (i) and (ii) above in this Section 1 is herein
collectively called the 'Indebtedness'). This Guaranty covers the Indebtedness,
whether presently outstanding or arising subsequent to the date hereof. The
guaranty of Guarantor as set forth in this Section 1 is a continuing guaranty of
payment and not a guaranty of collection.

2. Primary Liability of Guarantor.

(a) This Guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable and unconditional
guaranty of payment. Guarantor shall be liable for the payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations, as set forth in this Guaranty, as a primary
obligor. This Guaranty shall be effective as a waiver of, and Guarantor
<PAGE>
hereby expressly waives, any and all rights to which Guarantor may
otherwise have been entitled under any suretyship laws in effect from time
to time.

(b) In the event of default by Borrower, PRN and/or Holdings, in
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, when such
indebtedness becomes due, either by its terms or as the result of the
exercise of any power to accelerate, Guarantor shall, on demand and without
presentment, protest, notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, protest,
further notice of nonpayment or of dishonor or of default or
nonperformance, or notice of acceleration or of intent to accelerate, or
any other notice whatsoever, make payment in respect of or fully perform,
as the case may be, the Guaranteed Obligations. Further, it shall not be
necessary for KCIT, in order to enforce such payment by Guarantor, first to
institute suit or pursue or exhaust any rights or remedies against
Borrower, PRN, Holdings or others liable on such indebtedness, or to
enforce any rights against any security that shall ever have been given to
secure such indebtedness, or to join Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any others
liable for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof in
any action to enforce this Guaranty, or to resort to any other means of
obtaining payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(c) Suit may be brought or demand may be made against all parties who
have signed this Guaranty or any other guaranty covering all or any part of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any one or more of them, separately
or together, without impairing the rights of KCIT against any party hereto.
At any time that KCIT is entitled to exercise its rights or remedies
hereunder, it may in its discretion elect to demand payment.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if
following an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes) by Borrower, PRN
and/or Holdings under any of the Notes, the acceleration of the Notes is
prohibited pursuant to (i) that certain Standstill Agreement dated as of
September 30, 1994, by and among PRN, KCIT and Congress Financial
Corporation ('Congress'), (ii) that certain Subordination and Standstill
Agreement dated September 30, 1994, by and among Borrower, KCIT and
Congress, or (iii) that certain Subordination and Standstill Agreement
dated September 30, 1994 entered into by and among Holdings, KCIT and
Congress (said agreements being herein collectively called the 'Standstill
Agreements'), then Guarantor shall, on demand and without presentment,
protest, notice of acceptance of the Guaranty, further notice of
non-payment or of dishonor or of default or non-performance, or any notice
of acceleration or notice of intent to accelerate or any notice whatsoever,
make payment to KCIT, or the then owner or holder of the Notes, in an
amount equal to the then entire outstanding balance, including all
principal, regardless of whether or not same is then due under the terms of
the Notes, and accrued but unpaid interest thereon, of the Guaranteed
Obligations. Furthermore, it shall not be necessary for KCIT, in order to
enforce such payment by Guarantor, first to institute suit or pursue or
exhaust any rights or remedies against Borrower, PRN, Holdings or others
liable on such indebtedness or to enforce any rights against security that
shall ever have been given to secure such indebtedness, or to join
Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any others liable for payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof in any action to enforce this Guaranty, or
to resort to any other means of obtaining payment or performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

3. Certain Agreements and Waivers by Guarantor.

(a) Guarantor hereby agrees that neither KCIT's rights or remedies nor
Guarantor's obligations under the terms of this Guaranty shall be released,
diminished, impaired, reduced or affected by any one or more of the
following events, actions, facts, or circumstances, and the liability of
Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective of:

(i) any limitation of liability or recourse in any other document
relating to the Guaranteed Obligations or arising under any law;

(ii) the taking or accepting of any other security or guaranty for
any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;

1
<PAGE>
(iii) any release, surrender, abandonment, exchange, alteration,
sale or other disposition, subordination, deterioration, waste, failure
to protect or preserve, impairment, or loss of, or any failure to create
or perfect any lien or security interest with respect to, or any other
dealings with, any collateral or security at any time existing or
purported, believed or expected to exist in connection with any or all
of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(iv) whether express or by operation of law, any partial release of
the liability of Guarantor hereunder, or if one or more other guaranties
are now or hereafter obtained by KCIT covering all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations, any complete or partial release of any one or
more of such guarantors under any such other guaranty, or any complete
or partial release of Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any other party liable,
directly or indirectly, for the payment or performance of any or all of
the Guaranteed Obligations;

(v) the insolvency, bankruptcy, disability, dissolution,
liquidation, termination, receivership, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, change of form, structure or ownership, sale of all
assets, or lack of corporate, partnership or other power of Borrower,
PRN, Holdings or any other party at any time liable for the payment of
any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(vi) either with or without notice to or consent of Guarantor: any
renewal, extension, modification or rearrangement of the terms of any or
all of the Guaranteed Obligations (including the Notes), including,
without limitation, material alterations of the terms of payment
(including changes in maturity date(s) and interest rate(s)) or
performance or any other terms thereof, or any waiver, termination, or
release of, or consent to departure from, the Notes or any other
guaranty of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any adjustment,
indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that may be granted from time to
time by KCIT to Borrower, PRN, Holdings, Guarantor, and/or any other
party at any time liable for the payment of any or all of the Guaranteed
Obligations;

(vii) any neglect, lack of diligence, delay, omission, failure, or
refusal of KCIT to (a) take or prosecute (or in taking or prosecuting)
any action for the collection or enforcement of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or (b) foreclose or take or prosecute any action to
foreclose (or in foreclosing or taking or prosecuting any action to
foreclose) upon any security therefor, or (c) exercise (or in
exercising) any other right or power with respect to any security
therefor, or (d) take or prosecute (or in taking or prosecuting) any
action in connection with any document relating to the Guaranteed
Obligations,

(viii) any failure to sell or otherwise dispose of in a
commercially reasonable manner any collateral securing any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

(ix) any failure of KCIT to notify Guarantor of any creation,
renewal, extension, rearrangement, modification, supplement, or
assignment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or of the
Notes, or of any release of or change in any security or of any other
action taken or refrained from being taken by KCIT against Borrower, PRN
or Holdings or any security, it being understood that KCIT shall not be
required to give Guarantor any notice of any kind under any
circumstances with respect to or in connection with the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any and all rights to notice that Guarantor may have
otherwise had being hereby waived by Guarantor;

(x) KCIT being required to refund any payment by Borrower to
Borrower, by PRN to PRN or by Holdings to Holdings, as the case may be,
or any other party liable for the payment of any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;

(xi) the existence of any claim, set-off, or other right that
Guarantor may at any time have against Borrower, PRN or Holdings whether
or not arising in connection with this Guaranty or the Notes (provided,
that nothing contained herein shall prevent the assertion of any such
claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim); or

2
<PAGE>
(xii) the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations against Borrower, PRN or Holdings, whether because the
Guaranteed Obligations exceed the amount permitted by law or violate any
usury law, or because the act of creating the Guaranteed Obligations, or
any part thereof, is ultra vires, or because the officers or persons
creating same acted in excess of their authority, or because of a lack
of validity or enforceability of or defect or deficiency in the Notes,
or because of the subordination of, or moratorium on, payments due and
owing under the Notes at such times as the same would otherwise become
due and owing under the Notes but for such subordination or moratium,
regardless of the party or parties, including, without limitation,
Congress Financial Corporation, intended to be benefited by such
subordination or moratium or because Borrower's, PRN's or Holding's
obligation ceases to exist by operation of law, or because of any other
reason or circumstance, it being agreed that Guarantor shall remain
liable hereon regardless of whether Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any other
person be found not liable on the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part
thereof, for any reason (and regardless of any joinder of Borrower, PRN,
Holdings or any other party in any action to obtain payment of any or
all of the Guaranteed Obligations); provided, however, that if any part
of the Guaranteed Obligations is not enforceable against Borrower, PRN
or Holdings, as the case may be, because of the proper exercise of any
right of set-off against the Notes pursuant to the terms of the
Acquisition Agreement, that such part of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall not be enforceable against Guarantor.

(b) In the event any payment by Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any other
party to KCIT is held to constitute a preference, fraudulent transfer or
other voidable payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or
if for any other reason KCIT is required to refund such payment or pay the
amount thereof to any other party, such payment by Borrower, PRN, Holdings
or any other party to KCIT shall not constitute a release of Guarantor from
any liability hereunder, and this Guaranty shall continue to be effective
or shall be reinstated (notwithstanding any prior release or discharge by
KCIT of this Guaranty or of Guarantor), as the case may be, with respect
to, and this Guaranty shall apply to, any and all amounts so refunded by
KCIT or paid by KCIT to another party, together with any interest paid by
KCIT and any attorneys' fees, costs and expenses paid or incurred by KCIT
in connection with any such event (all of which amounts shall constitute
part of the Guaranteed Obligations). It is the intent of Guarantor and KCIT
that the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor hereunder are absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances and that until the
Guaranteed Obligations are fully and finally paid, and not subject to
refund or disgorgement, the obligations and liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder shall not be discharged or released, in whole or in part, by any
act or occurrence that might, but for the provisions of this Guaranty, be
deemed a legal or equitable discharge or release of a guarantor. KCIT shall
be entitled to continue to hold this Guaranty in its possession for a
period of one year from the date the Guaranteed Obligations are paid and
performed in full and for so long thereafter as may be necessary to enforce
any obligation of Guarantor hereunder and/or to exercise any right or
remedy of KCIT hereunder.

(c) If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by
Borrower, PRN and/or Holdings under the Notes is stayed or delayed by (i)
any law or tribunal, or (ii) pursuant to the terms of the Standstill
Agreements, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by Guarantor on
demand by KCIT.

4. Other Liability. If Guarantor becomes liable for any indebtedness owing
by Borrower, PRN or Holdings to KCIT other than under this Guaranty, such
liability shall not be in any manner impaired or affected hereby, and the rights
of KCIT hereunder shall be cumulative of any and all other rights that KCIT may
have against Guarantor. If Borrower, PRN or Holdings is or becomes indebted to
KCIT for any indebtedness other than or in excess of the Indebtedness for which
Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty, any payment received or recovery
realized upon any indebtedness of Borrower, PRN or Holdings to KCIT may, except
to the extent paid by Guarantor on the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is
liable under this Guaranty or specifically required by law or agreement of KCIT
to be

3
<PAGE>
applied to the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty,
in KCIT's sole discretion, be applied upon indebtedness of Borrower, PRN or
Holdings to KCIT other than the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under
this Guaranty.

5. KCIT Assigns. This Guaranty is for the benefit of KCIT and KCIT's
successors and assigns, and in the event of a permitted assignment of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, the rights and benefits hereunder,
to the extent applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations so assigned, may be
transferred with such Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor waives notice of any
transfer or assignment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, and
agrees that failure to give notice will not affect the liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder.

6. Binding Effect. This Guaranty is binding not only on Guarantor, but also
on Guarantor's successors and assigns. Words importing persons herein shall
include firms, associations, partnerships (including limited partnerships),
joint ventures, trusts, corporations and other legal entities, including public
or governmental bodies, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as natural
persons.

7. Governing Law. This Guaranty, and its validity, enforcement, and
interpretation, shall for all purposes by governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable United States
federal law, and is intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the
extent permitted by, such laws. All obligations of Guarantor hereunder are
payable and performable at the place or places where the Guaranteed Obligations
are payable and performable.

8. Invalidity of Certain Provisions. If any provision of this Guaranty or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for any reason and
to any extent, be judicially declared to be invalid or unenforceable, neither
the remaining provisions of this Guaranty nor the application of such provision
to any other Person or circumstance shall be affected thereby, and the remaining
provisions of this Guaranty, or the applicability of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances, as applicable, shall remain in effect and be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

9. Attorneys' Fees and Costs of Collection. Guarantor shall pay on demand
all reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs and expenses incurred by KCIT
in the enforcement of or preservation of KCIT's rights under this Guaranty.
Guarantor agrees to pay interest on any expenses or other sums due to KCIT under
this Section 9 that are not paid when due, at a rate per annum equal to the
lesser of (i) the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law, or (ii)
the Default Rate (as defined in the Notes). Guarantor's obligations and
liabilities under this Section 9 shall survive any payment or discharge in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations.

10. Payments. All sums payable under this Guaranty shall be paid in lawful
money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal
tender for the payment of public and private debts.

11. Controlling Agreement. It is not the intention of KCIT or Guarantor to
obligate Guarantor to pay interest in excess of that lawfully permitted to be
paid by Guarantor under applicable law. Should it be determined that any portion
of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amount payable by Guarantor under
this Guaranty constitutes interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest
that Guarantor, in Guarantor's capacity as guarantor, may lawfully be required
to pay under applicable law, the obligation of Guarantor to pay such interest
shall automatically be limited to the payment thereof in the maximum amount so
permitted under applicable law. The provisions of this Section 11 shall override
and control all other provisions of this Guaranty and of any other agreement
between Guarantor and KCIT.

12. Representations, Warranties, and Covenants of Guarantor. Guarantor
hereby represents, warrants, and covenants that (a) after giving effect to this
Guaranty, Guarantor is solvent, and does not intend to incur or believe that it
will incur debts that will be beyond its ability to pay as such debts mature;
(b) KCIT has no duty at any time to investigate or inform Guarantor of the
financial or business condition or affairs of Borrower, PRN or Holdings or any
change therein, and Guarantor will keep itself fully appraised of Borrower's,
PRN's and Holdings' financial and business condition; (c) Guarantor acknowledges
and agrees that Guarantor may be required to pay and perform the

4
<PAGE>
Guaranteed Obligations in full without assistance or support from Borrower, PRN,
Holdings or any other party; and (d) Guarantor has read and fully understand the
provisions contained in the Notes. Guarantor's representations, warranties and
covenants are a material inducement to KCIT to make the Loan and accept the
Notes and shall survive the execution hereof and any bankruptcy, foreclosure,
transfer of security or other event affecting Borrower, PRN, Holdings,
Guarantor, any other party, or any security for all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

13. Notices. Unless specifically provided otherwise, any notice for
purposes of this Guaranty or any other document relating hereto shall be given
in writing or by telex or by facsimile (fax) transmission and shall be addressed
or delivered to the respective addresses set forth in this Guaranty, or to such
other address as may have been previously designated by the intended recipient
by notice given in accordance with this Section. If sent by prepaid, registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested), the notice shall be deemed
effective when deposited in a regularly maintained receptacle of the United
States Postal Service; if transmitted by telex, the notice shall be effective
when transmitted (answerback confirmed); and if transmitted by facsimile or
personal delivery, the notice shall be effective when received. No notice of
change of address shall be effective except upon actual receipt. This Section 13
shall not be construed in any way to affect or impair any waiver of notice or
demand provided in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document or to require
giving notice or demand to or upon any Person in any situation or for any
reason.

14. Cumulative Rights. The exercise of KCIT of any right or remedy
hereunder or under the Notes, or at law or in equity, shall not preclude the
concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy. KCIT shall have
all rights, remedies and recourses afforded to KCIT by reason of this Guaranty,
the Notes, or by law, equity or otherwise, and the same (a) shall be cumulative
and concurrent, (b) may be pursued separately, successively or concurrently
against Guarantor or others obligated for the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
part thereof, or against any one or more of them, or against any security or
otherwise, at the sole discretion of KCIT, (c) may be exercised as often as
occasion therefor shall arise, it being agreed by Guarantor that the exercise
of, discontinuance of the exercise of or failure to exercise any of such rights,
remedies, or recourses shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release
thereof or of any other right, remedy, or recourse, and (d) are intended to be,
and shall be, non-exclusive. No waiver of any default on the part of Guarantor
or of any breach of any of the provisions of this Guaranty or of any other
document shall be considered a waiver of any other or subsequent default or
breach, and no delay or omission in exercising or enforcing the rights and
powers granted herein or in any other document shall be construed as a waiver of
such rights and powers, and no exercise or enforcement of any rights or powers
hereunder or under any other document shall be held to exhaust such rights and
powers, and every such right and power may be exercised from time to time. The
granting of any consent, approval or waiver by KCIT shall be limited to the
specific instance and purpose therefor and shall not constitute consent or
approval in any other instance or for any other purpose. No notice to or demand
on Guarantor in any case shall of itself entitle Guarantor to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No provision of this
Guaranty or any right, remedy or recourse of KCIT with respect hereto, or any
default or breach, can be waived, nor can this Guaranty or Guarantor be released
or discharged in any way or to any extent, except specifically in each case by a
writing intended for that purpose (and which refers specifically to this
Guaranty) executed, and delivered to Guarantor, by KCIT.

15. Term of Guaranty. This Guaranty shall continue in effect until all the
Guaranteed Obligations are fully and finally paid, and discharged, except that,
and notwithstanding any return of this Guaranty to Guarantor, this Guaranty
shall continue in effect (i) with respect to all obligations and liabilities of
Guarantor under Section 9 of this Guaranty, and (ii) as provided in Section 4(b)
hereof.

16. Further Assurances. Guarantor at Guarantor's expense will promptly
execute and deliver to KCIT upon KCIT's request all such other and further
documents, agreements, and instruments in compliance with or accomplishment of
the agreements of Guarantor under this Guaranty.

fiscal quarter of Borrower following the date hereof, Borrower shall pay to
Lender mandatory prepayments of the principal amount of the Term Loan as

amount of Borrower's accounts payable between the beginning and the end of
the applicable period.

(d)(i) Borrower may, prior to the earlier of an Event of Default and

Agreement, prepay the outstanding balance of the Term Loan, in part,
provided that any such partial prepayment must not be less than $500,000,
in each instance, and must be in multiples of $500,000, provided, that,
concurrently with each such prepayment, Borrower pays to Lender (A) all
interest accrued on the Term Loan as of the date of such prepayment and (B)
a prepayment fee in an amount equal to the amount of such prepayment times
the applicable percentage for each of the periods set forth below,
determined, in each instance, as of the date Lender receives such
prepayment ('Partial Voluntary Prepayment Fee'):

3/4 of 1% October 1, 1995 to September 30, 1996
1% October 1, 1996 to September 30, 1997
1 1/2% October 1, 1997 to September 29, 1998
</TABLE>

(ii) Borrower may, prior to the earlier of an Event of Default and
acceleration of the Term Loan or the fourth annual anniversary date of this
Agreement, prepay the outstanding balance of the Term Loan, in whole, provided,
that, concurrently with such prepayment, Borrower pays to Lender (A) all
interest accrued on the Term Loan as of the date of such prepayment, (B) all
other Obligations owed to Lender, and (C) a prepayment fee in an amount equal to
(1) the applicable amount set forth below for each of the periods set forth

645,000 October 1, 1997 to September 29, 1998
</TABLE>

(iii) On or after September 30, 1998, Borrower may prepay the Term Loan in
whole, but not in part, without payment of any prepayment fee, provided, that,
all interest accrued on the Term Loan and all other Obligations shall have been
paid in full to Lender concurrently therewith.

(e) If, prior to the fourth annual anniversary date hereof, an Event of
Default occurs and Lender accelerates the Term Loan, Borrower shall pay
to Lender, in addition to the principal balance of the Term Loan, all interest
thereon and all other Obligations owed to Lender, a fee, which fee shall be
fully earned as of the date said Event of Default occurs and Lender
accelerates the Term Loan ('Fee Determination Date'), in an amount equal to
(i) the applicable amount set forth below, for each of the periods set forth
below, determined as of the date in which such Fee Determination Date occurs,
less (ii) the aggregate amount of all Partial Voluntary Prepayment Fees,
if any, received by Lender prior to the Fee Determination Date:

<TABLE>

430,000 October 1, 1996 to September 30, 1997
645,000 October 1, 1997 to September 29, 1998

above, Borrower shall not be obligated to pay a prepayment fee for any mandatory
prepayment made at any time pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) hereof.

(g) The prepayment fee payable under either Subsections (d) or (e) hereof
has been mutually agreed upon by Borrower and Lender as a reasonable calculation
of Lender's lost profits as a result of such prepayment and the impracticability
and extreme difficulty of calculating actual damages with respect thereto. Such
prepayment fee shall be presumed to be the amount of damages sustained by Lender
as a result of such prepayment and Borrower agrees that it is reasonable under
the circumstances currently existing.

SECTION 3. INTEREST AND FEES

3.1 Interest.

(a) Borrower shall pay to Lender interest on the outstanding principal
amount of the Obligations at the Interest Rate. All interest accruing under the
Term Note and on the other Obligations on and after the date of any Event of
Default shall be payable on demand.

(b) Borrower may from time to time request that Prime Rate Loans be
converted to Eurodollar Rate Loans or that any existing Eurodollar Rate Loans
continue for an additional Interest Period. Such request from Borrower shall
specify the amount of the Prime Rate Loans which will constitute Eurodollar Rate
Loans (subject to the limits set forth below) and the Interest Period to be
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, three (3) Business Days after receipt by Lender of such a
request from Borrower, such Prime Rate Loans shall be converted to Eurodollar
Rate Loans or such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall continue, as the case may be,
provided, that, (i) no Event of Default, or event which with notice or passage
of time or both would constitute an Event of Default exists or has occurred and
is continuing, (ii) Borrower shall have complied with such customary procedures
as are established by Lender and specified by Lender to Borrower from time to
time for requests by Borrower for Eurodollar Rate Loans, (iii) the aggregate
amount of the Eurodollar Rate Loans must be in an amount not less than the
entire outstanding balance of the Term Loan which it is anticipated will be
outstanding as of the last day of the applicable Interest

11
<PAGE>
Period, as determined by Lender, and the elected Interest Period must begin on
the first day of a calendar month and end on the last day of a calendar month,
(iv) the maximum amount of the Eurodollar Rate Loans at any time requested by
Borrower shall not exceed the amount equal to the principal amount of the Term
Loan which it is anticipated will be outstanding as of the last day of the
applicable Interest Period, as determined by Lender and (v) Lender shall have
determined that the Interest Period and Adjusted Eurodollar Rate is available to
Lender through the Reference Bank and can be readily determined as of the date
of the request for such Eurodollar Rate Loan by Borrower. Any request by
Borrower to convert Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans or to continue any
existing Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be irrevocable. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Lender and Reference Bank shall not be required
to purchase United States Dollar deposits in the London interbank market or
other applicable Eurodollar Rate market to fund any Eurodollar Rate Loans, but
the provisions hereof shall be deemed to apply as if Lender and Reference Bank
had purchased such deposits to fund the Eurodollar Rate Loans.

(c) Any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall automatically convert to Prime Rate
Loans upon the last day of the applicable Interest Period, unless Lender has
received and approved a request to continue such Eurodollar Rate Loan at least
three (3) Business Days prior to such last day in accordance with the terms
hereof. Any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall, at Lender's option, upon notice by
Lender to Borrower, convert to Prime Rate Loans in the event that (i) an Event
of Default or event which with the notice or passage of time or both would
constitute an Event of Default, shall exist, or (ii) the aggregate principal
amount of the Prime Rate Loans which have previously been converted to
Eurodollar Rate Loans or existing Eurodollar Rate Loans continued, as the case
may be, at the beginning of an Interest Period shall at any time during such
Interest Period exceed the then outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan.
Borrower shall pay to Lender, upon demand by Lender (or Lender may, at its
option, charge any loan account of Borrower) any amounts required to compensate
Lender, the Reference Bank or any participant with Lender for any loss
(including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by such
person, as a result of the conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Prime Rate
Loans pursuant to any of the foregoing.

(d) Interest shall be payable by Borrower to Lender monthly in arrears not
later than the first day of each calendar month and shall be calculated on the
basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed. The
interest rate on non-contingent Obligations (other than Eurodollar Rate Loans)
shall increase or decrease by an amount equal to each increase or decrease in
the Prime Rate effective on the first day of the month after any change in such
Prime Rate is announced based on the Prime Rate in effect on the last day of the
month in which any such change occurs. In no event shall charges constituting
interest payable by Borrower to Lender exceed the maximum amount or the rate
permitted under any applicable law or regulation, and if any such part or
provision of this Agreement is in contravention of any such law or regulation,
such part or provision shall be deemed amended to conform thereto.

3.2 Closing Fee. Borrower shall pay to Lender as a closing fee an amount
equal to one and one-quarter (1 1/4%) percent of the original principal amount
of the Term Loan less any amounts previously paid by Borrower to Lender as a
commitment fee with respect thereto, which closing fee shall be fully earned as
of the date hereof, $75,000 of which is payable on the date hereof and the
balance of which is payable on the earlier of the first anniversary date of this
Agreement or the consummation of an initial public offering of debt or equity of
Holdings or any subsidiary of Holdings.

3.3 Servicing Fee. Borrower shall pay to Lender quarterly a servicing fee
in an amount equal to $2,500 in respect of Lender's services for each calendar
quarter (or part thereof) while this Agreement remains in effect and for so long
thereafter as any of the Obligations are outstanding, which fee shall be fully
earned as of and payable in advance on the date hereof and on the first day of
each calendar quarter hereafter.

3.4 Success Fee. If Holdings or any subsidiary of Holdings consummates an
initial public offering of debt or equity, Borrower, Holdings and Parent
shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay to Lender a success fee in
an amount equal to one-half of one (1/2 of 1%) percent of the gross proceeds
of such initial public offering, payable simultaneously with the consummation
of such initial public offering, which fee is fully earned as of the date of
such initial public offering.

12
<PAGE>
3.5 Syndication Fee. Borrower, Holdings and Parent shall be jointly and
severally obligated to pay to Lender a syndication fee in an amount equal to
one-quarter of one (1/4 of 1%) percent of the original principal amount of the
Term Loan, payable simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, $50,000
of which was earned on August 22, 1994 and the remaining balance of which is
fully earned as of the date hereof.

3.6 Changes in Laws and Increased Costs of Loans.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall, upon notice by Lender to Borrower, convert to Prime
Rate Loans in the event that (i) any change in applicable law or regulation (or
the interpretation or administration thereof) shall either (A) make it unlawful
for Lender, Reference Bank or any participant to make or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Loans or to comply with the terms hereof in connection with the Eurodollar
Rate Loans, by an amount deemed by Lender to be material, or (B) shall result in
the increase in the costs to Lender, Reference Bank or any Participant of making
or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans or (C) reduce the amounts received or
receivable by Lender in respect thereof, by an amount deemed by Lender to be
material or (ii) the cost to Lender, Reference Bank or any participant of making
or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall otherwise increase by an amount
deemed by Lender to be material. Borrower shall pay to Lender, upon demand by
Lender (or Lender may, at its option, charge any loan account of Borrower) any
amounts required to compensate Lender, the Reference Bank or any participant
with Lender for any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or
expense incurred by such person as a result of the foregoing, including, without
limitation, any such loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such person to make or
maintain the Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof. A certificate of
Lender setting forth the basis for the determination of such amount necessary to
compensate Lender as aforesaid shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error.

(b) If any payments or prepayments in respect of the Eurodollar Rate Loans
are received by Lender other than on the last day of the applicable Interest
Period (whether pursuant to acceleration, upon maturity or otherwise), including
any payments made with the proceeds of Collateral, Borrower shall pay to Lender
upon demand by Lender (or Lender may, at its option, charge any loan account of
Borrower) any amounts required to compensate Lender, the Reference Bank or any
participant with Lender for any additional loss (including loss of anticipated
profits), cost or expense incurred by such person as a result of such prepayment
or payment, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such person to make or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion
thereof.

for Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, including principal,
interest, fees, costs and expenses. Each such statement shall be subject to
subsequent adjustment by Lender but shall, absent manifest errors or omissions,
be considered correct and deemed accepted by Borrower and conclusively binding
upon Borrower as an account stated except to the extent that Lender receives a
written notice from Borrower of any specific exceptions of Borrower thereto
within thirty (30) days after the date such statement has been mailed by Lender.
Until such time as Lender shall have rendered to Borrower a written statement as
provided above, the balance in Borrower's loan account(s) shall be presumptive
evidence of the amounts due and owing to Lender by Borrower.

6.3 Collection of Accounts.

(a) Old PRN shall be irrevocably directed by Borrower and shall agree to
directly remit to Lender (which may be by a debit to Old PRN's loan account with
Lender and a credit by Lender for Borrower's account as provided below) (i) the
Estimated Revenues for the initial fifteen (15) days of each calendar month (or
at more frequent periods during each calendar month if Lender so requests) not
later than three (3) business days after the end of such period, and (ii) the
Actual Revenues Payment for each calendar month, together with a certificate of
the President or Chief Financial Officer of Old PRN as to the calculation
thereof, not later than ten (10) business days after the end of such calendar
month. The Estimated Revenues remitted to Lender for each calendar month shall
be credited by Lender to a blocked account for Borrower maintained by Lender
(the 'Provisional Account') and upon remittance to Lender of the Actual Revenues
Payment for such calendar month, the outstanding balance of the Provisional
Account for such calendar month shall be debited and then, together with such
Actual Revenues Payment, credited to an availability account for Borrower
maintained by Lender (the 'Availability Account'). Lender shall have the right
to charge and set off against the Provisional Account and the Availability
Account for any of the Obligations which are then due and payable. Both the
Provisional Account and the Availability Account shall constitute additional
collateral for the Obligations and, at any time, an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Lender may charge and set off against the
Provisional Account and the Availability Account for any of the Obligations,
whether or not then due and payable. Unless an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Lender will remit the outstanding balance of the Availability
Account or any portion thereof to Borrower at the request of Borrower and debit
the Availability Account for such advance. The outstanding balance from time to
time of the Provisional Account will be credited by Lender with interest at the
current Interest Rate (as defined in the Old PRN Agreements and not hereunder)
and, although the Provisional Account is the property of Borrower, Borrower
agrees (since the Estimated Revenues payment represents a payment in advance not
otherwise due pursuant to the Revenue Agreement) that all such accrued interest
shall be credited by Lender to the interest payable by Old PRN to Lender
pursuant to the Old PRN Agreements. The outstanding balance from time to time of
the Availability Account will be credited by Lender with interest at the current
Interest Rate (as defined in this Agreement) and all such accrued interest shall
be credited to the interest payable by Borrower with respect to the Term Loan.

(b) If the Revenue Agreement has been terminated and is not renewed or
extended, on terms and conditions satisfactory to Lender, and with respect to
Collateral not subject to Section 6(a) above, Borrower shall establish and
maintain, at its expense, blocked accounts or lockboxes and related blocked
accounts (in either case, 'Blocked Accounts'), as Lender may specify, at the
request of Lender, with such banks as are acceptable to Lender into which
Borrower shall promptly deposit and direct its account debtors to directly remit
all payments on Accounts and all payments constituting proceeds other Collateral
in the identical form in which such payments are made, whether by cash, check or
other manner. The banks at which the Blocked Accounts are established shall
enter into an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, providing
that all items received or deposited in the Blocked Accounts are the property of
Lender, that the depository bank has no lien upon, or right to setoff against,
the Blocked Accounts, the items received for deposit therein, or the funds from
time to time on deposit therein and that the depository bank will wire, or
otherwise transfer, in immediately

16
<PAGE>
available funds, on a daily basis, all funds received or deposited into the
Blocked Accounts to such bank account of Lender as Lender may from time to time
designate for such purpose ('Payment Account'). For purposes of calculating
interest on the Obligations, such payments or other funds received will be
applied (conditional upon final collection) to the Obligations one (1) business
day following the date of receipt of immediately available funds by Lender in
the Payment Account.

(c) Borrower agrees that all payments made to Blocked Accounts or other
funds received and collected by Lender, whether on the Accounts or as proceeds
of Inventory or other Collateral or otherwise (except as specifically provided
in clause (a) above) shall be the property of Lender. Borrower and all of its
affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, directors, employees or agents shall,
acting as trustee for Lender, receive, as the property of Lender, any monies,
checks, notes, drafts or any other payment relating to and/or proceeds of
Accounts or other Collateral which come into their possession or under their
control and immediately upon receipt thereof, shall deposit or cause the same to
be deposited in the Blocked Accounts, or remit the same or cause the same to be
remitted, in kind, to Lender. In no event shall the same be commingled with
Borrower's own funds. Borrower agrees to reimburse Lender on demand for any
amounts owed or paid to any bank at which a Blocked Account is established or
any other bank or person involved in the transfer of funds to or from the
Blocked Accounts arising out of Lender's payments to or indemnification of such
bank or person. The obligation of Borrower to reimburse Lender for such amounts
pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall survive the termination or non-renewal of
this Agreement.

6.4 Payments. All Obligations shall be payable to the Payment Account as
provided in Section 6.3 or such other place as Lender may designate from time to
time. Lender may apply payments received or collected from Borrower or for the
account of Borrower (including, without limitation, the monetary proceeds of
collections or of realization upon any Collateral) to such of the Obligations,
whether or not then due, in such order and manner as Lender determines. At
Lender's option, all principal, interest, fees, costs, expenses and other
charges provided for in this Agreement or the other Financing Agreements may be
charged directly to the loan account(s) of Borrower. Borrower shall make all
payments to Lender on the Obligations free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any setoff, counterclaim, defense, duties,
taxes, levies, imposts, fees, deductions, withholding, restrictions or
conditions of any kind. If after receipt of any payment of, or proceeds of
Collateral applied to the payment of, any of the Obligations, Lender is required
to surrender or return such payment or proceeds to any Person for any reason,
then the Obligations intended to be satisfied by such payment or proceeds shall
be reinstated and continue and this Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Lender. Borrower
shall be liable to pay to Lender, and does hereby indemnify and hold Lender
harmless for the amount of any payments or proceeds surrendered or returned.
This Section 6.4 shall remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action
which may be taken by Lender in reliance upon such payment or proceeds. This
Section 6.4 shall survive the payment of the Obligations and the termination or
non-renewal of this Agreement.

6.5 Use of Proceeds. Borrower shall use all of the proceeds of the Term
Loan provided by Lender to Borrower hereunder only for: (a) payments to each of
the persons listed in the disbursement direction letter furnished by Borrower to
Lender on or about the date hereof and (b) costs, expenses and fees in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Financing Agreements and (c) expenses relating to the
consummation of the acquisition of the Purchased Assets. None of the proceeds
will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
any margin security or for the purposes of reducing or retiring any indebtedness
which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin security or for
any other purpose which might cause any of the Loans to be considered a 'purpose
credit' within the meaning of Regulation G of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, as amended.

documents in a form satisfactory to Lender: (a) upon Lender's request, copies of

and shall remain personal property and Borrower shall not permit any of the
Inventory or Equipment to be or become a part of or affixed to real property;
and (g) Borrower assumes all responsibility and liability arising from the use

7.3 Power of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably designates and appoints
Lender (and all persons designated by Lender) as Borrower's true and lawful

arising from any act or acts under this power of attorney and in furtherance
thereof, whether of omission or commission, except as a result of Lender's own
gross negligence or wilful misconduct as determined pursuant to a final
non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

7.4 Right to Cure. Lender may, at its option, upon two (2) business days
notice to Borrower if no Event of Default then exists or, if an Event of Default
then exists without notice, (a) cure any default by Borrower under any agreement
with a third party or pay or bond on appeal any judgment entered

obligation to effect such cure, payment or bonding and shall not, by doing so,
be deemed to have assumed any obligation or liability of Borrower. Any payment
made or other action taken by Lender under this Section shall be without
prejudice to any right to assert an Event of Default hereunder and to proceed
accordingly.

cost and expense of Borrower, (a) Lender or its designee shall have complete

and records, including, without limitation, the Records, and (b) Borrower shall
promptly furnish to Lender such copies of such books and records or extracts
therefrom as Lender may request, and (c) use during normal business hours such

necessary for the foregoing and if an Event of Default exists or has occurred
and is continuing for the realization of Collateral.

SECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Lender the following (which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement), the truth and
accuracy of which are a continuing condition of the making of Loans by Lender to
Borrower:

8.1 Corporate Existence, Power and Authority; Subsidiaries. Borrower is a
corporation duly organized and in good standing under the laws of its state of
incorporation and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good
standing in all states or other jurisdictions where the nature and extent of the
business transacted by it or the ownership of assets makes such qualification
necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify
would not have a material adverse effect on Borrower's financial condition,
results of operation or business or the rights of Lender in or to any of the
Collateral. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the other
Financing Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder
are all within Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized and are
not in contravention of law or the terms of Borrower's certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, or other organizational documentation, or any indenture,
agreement or undertaking to which Borrower is a party or by which Borrower or
its property are bound. This Agreement and the other Financing Agreements
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms. Borrower does not have any subsidiaries
except as set forth on the Information Certificate.

8.2 Financial Statements; No Material Adverse Change. All financial
statements relating to Borrower which have been or may hereafter be delivered by
Borrower to Lender have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present
the financial condition and the results of operation of Borrower as at the dates
and for the periods set forth therein. Except as disclosed in any interim
financial statements furnished by Borrower to Lender prior to the date of this
Agreement, there has been no material adverse change in the assets, liabilities,
properties and condition, financial or otherwise, of Borrower, since the date of
the most recent audited financial statements furnished by Borrower to Lender
prior to the date of this Agreement.

8.3 Chief Executive Office; Collateral Locations. The chief executive
office of Borrower and Borrower's Records concerning Accounts are located only
at the address set forth below and it has no other place of business.

8.4 Priority of Liens; Title to Properties. The security interests and
liens granted to Lender under this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements
constitute valid and perfected first priority liens

19
<PAGE>
and security interests in and upon the Collateral subject only to purchase money
liens permitted under Section 9.8(e) hereof. Borrower has good and marketable
title to all of its properties and assets subject to no liens, mortgages,
pledges, security interests, encumbrances or charges of any kind, except those
granted to Lender or permitted under Section 9.8 hereof.

8.5 Tax Returns. Borrower has filed, or caused to be filed, in a timely
manner all tax returns, reports and declarations which are required to be filed
by it (without requests for extension except as previously disclosed in writing
to Lender). All information in such tax returns, reports and declarations is
complete and accurate in all material respects. Borrower has paid or caused to
be paid all taxes due and payable or claimed due and payable in any assessment
received by it, except taxes the validity of which are being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings diligently pursued and available to Borrower
and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set aside on its books.
Adequate provision has been made for the payment of all accrued and unpaid
Federal, State, county, local, foreign and other taxes whether or not yet due
and payable and whether or not disputed.

8.6 Litigation. Except as set forth on the Information Certificate, there
is no present investigation by any governmental agency pending, or to the best
of Borrower's knowledge threatened, against or affecting Borrower, its assets or
business and there is no action, suit, proceeding or claim by any Person
pending, or to the best of Borrower's knowledge threatened, against Borrower or
its assets or goodwill, or against or affecting any transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, which if adversely determined against Borrower would result in
any material adverse change in the assets, business or prospects of Borrower or
would impair the ability of Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or
under any of the other Financing Agreements to which it is a party or of Lender
to enforce any Obligations or realize upon any Collateral.

8.7 Compliance with Other Agreements and Applicable Laws. Borrower is not
in default in any material respect under, or in violation in any material
respect of any of the terms of, any agreement, contract, instrument, lease or
other commitment to which it is a party or by which it or any of its assets are
bound and Borrower is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
provisions of laws, rules, regulations, licenses, permits, approvals and orders
of any foreign, Federal, State or local governmental authority.

8.8 Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All information furnished by
or on behalf of Borrower in writing to Lender in connection with this Agreement
or any of the other Financing Agreements or any transaction contemplated hereby
or thereby, including, without limitation, all information on the Information
Certificate is true and correct in all material respects on the date as of which
such information is dated or certified and does not omit any material fact
necessary in order to make such information not misleading. No event or
circumstance has occurred which has had or could reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse affect on the business, assets or prospects of Borrower,
which has not been fully and accurately disclosed to Lender in writing.

8.9 Acquisition of Purchased Assets.

(a) The Purchase Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereunder
have been duly executed, delivered and performed in accordance with their terms
by the respective parties thereto in all respects, including the fulfillment
(not merely the waiver, except as may be disclosed to Lender and consented to in
writing by Lender) of all conditions precedent set forth therein and giving
effect to the terms of the Purchase Agreements and the assignments to be
executed and delivered by Sellers (or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries)
thereunder, Borrower acquired and has good and marketable title to the Purchased
Assets, free and clear of all claims, liens, pledges and encumbrances of any
kind, except as permitted hereunder.

(b) All actions and proceedings, required by the Purchase Agreements,
applicable law or regulation (including, but not limited to, compliance with the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-Trust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended) have been
taken and the transactions required thereunder have been duly and validly taken
and consummated.

20
<PAGE>
(c) No court of competent jurisdiction has issued any injunction,
restraining order or other order which prohibits consummation of the
transactions described in the Purchase Agreements and no governmental or other
action or proceeding has been threatened or commenced, seeking any injunction,
restraining order or other order which seeks to void or otherwise modify the
transactions described in the Purchase Agreements.

(d) Borrower has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to Lender, true,
correct and complete copies of the Purchase Agreements.

8.10 CAPITALIZATION.

(a) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Borrower
are directly and beneficially owned and held by Holdings, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of Holdings are directly and beneficially
owned and held by Parent and all of such shares have been duly authorized and
are fully paid and non-assessable, and all of such shares are free and clear of
all claims, liens, pledges and encumbrances of any kind, except for the pledge
thereof in favor of Lender.

(b) Borrower is solvent and will continue to be solvent after the creation
of the Obligations and the security interests of Lender contemplated hereunder,
is able to pay its debts as they mature and has (and has reason to believe it
will continue to have) sufficient capital (and not unreasonably small capital)
to carry on its business and all businesses in which it is about to engage. The
Purchased Assets acquired by Borrower have a purchase price greater than the
Indebtedness of Borrower on the date hereof, including subordinated and
contingent liabilities computed at the amount which, to the best of Borrower's
knowledge, represents an amount which can reasonably be expected to become an
actual or matured liability.

(c) Holdings has, on or before the date hereof, made a cash equity capital
contribution to Borrower in an amount not less than $21,000,000 as consideration
for shares of capital stock of Borrower consisting of common stock. The proceeds
of such cash equity capital contributions have been applied, contemporaneously
herewith, to the cash portion of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets.

8.11 Survival of Warranties; Cumulative. All representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall be deemed to have
been made again to Lender on the date of each additional borrowing or other
credit accommodation hereunder and shall be conclusively presumed to have been
relied on by Lender regardless of any investigation made or information
possessed by Lender. The representations and warranties set forth herein shall
be cumulative and in addition to any other representations or warranties which
Borrower shall now or hereafter give, or cause to be given, to Lender.

SECTION 9. AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS

9.1 Maintenance of Existence. Borrower shall at all times preserve, renew
and keep in full, force and effect its corporate existence and rights and
franchises with respect thereto and maintain in full force and effect all
permits, licenses, trademarks, tradenames, approvals, authorizations, leases and
contracts necessary to carry on the business as presently or proposed to be
conducted. Borrower shall give Lender thirty (30) days prior written notice of
any proposed change in its corporate name, which notice shall set forth the new
name and Borrower shall deliver to Lender a copy of the amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Borrower providing for the name change certified
by the Secretary of State of the jurisdiction of incorporation of Borrower as
soon as it is available.

9.2 New Locations. Borrower may not open any new location or place of
business without the prior written consent of Lender.

9.3 Compliance with Laws, Regulations, Etc. Borrower shall, at all times,
comply in all material respects with all laws, rules, regulations, licenses,

21
<PAGE>
9.4 Payment of Taxes and Claims. Borrower shall duly pay and discharge all
taxes, assessments, contributions and governmental charges upon or against it or
its properties or assets, except for taxes the validity of which are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently pursued and
available to Borrower and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set
aside on its books. Borrower shall be liable for any tax or penalties imposed on
Lender as a result of the financing arrangements provided for herein and
Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold Lender harmless with respect to the
foregoing, and to repay to Lender on demand the amount thereof, and until paid
by Borrower such amount shall be added and deemed part of the Loans, provided,
that, nothing contained herein shall be construed to require Borrower to pay any
income or franchise taxes attributable to the income of Lender from any amounts
charged or paid hereunder to Lender. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the
payment of the Obligations and the termination or non-renewal of this Agreement.

9.5 Insurance. Borrower shall, at all times, maintain with financially
sound and reputable insurers insurance with respect to the Collateral against
loss or damage and all other insurance of the kinds and in the amounts
customarily insured against or carried by corporations of established reputation
engaged in the same or similar businesses and similarly situated. Said policies
of insurance shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender as to form, amount and
insurer. Borrower shall furnish certificates, policies or endorsements to Lender
as Lender shall require as proof of such insurance, and, if Borrower fails to do
so, Lender is authorized, but not required, to obtain such insurance at the
expense of Borrower. All policies shall provide for at least thirty (30) days
prior written notice to Lender of any cancellation or reduction of coverage and
that Lender may act as attorney for Borrower in obtaining, and at any time an
Event of Default exists or has occurred and is continuing, adjusting, settling,
amending and canceling such insurance. Borrower shall cause Lender to be named
as a loss payee and an additional insured (but without any liability for any
premiums) under such insurance policies and Borrower shall obtain
non-contributory lender's loss payable endorsements to all insurance policies in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Such lender's loss payable
endorsements shall specify that the proceeds of such insurance shall be payable
to Lender as its interests may appear and further specify that Lender shall be
paid regardless of any act or omission by Borrower or any of its affiliates. At
its option, Lender may apply any insurance proceeds received by Lender at any
time to the cost of repairs or replacement of Collateral and/or to payment of
the Obligations, whether or not then due, in any order and in such manner as
Lender may determine or hold such proceeds as cash collateral for the
Obligations.

9.6 Financial Statements and Other Information.

(a) Borrower shall keep proper books and records in which true and complete
entries shall be made of all dealings or transactions of or in relation to the
Collateral and the business of Borrower and its subsidiaries (if any) in

Lender: (i) within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each fiscal month,
monthly and cumulative fiscal year-to-date and, within sixty (60) days after the
end of each fiscal quarter, cumulative fiscal quarter unaudited consolidated and
consolidating financial statements of Borrower, Holdings and their respective
subsidiaries (including in each case cumulative balance sheets, statements of

operations of Borrower, Holdings and their respective subsidiaries as of the end
of and through such fiscal month and, as applicable, fiscal quarter and

audited consolidating financial statements shall be required for Holdings or
Parent, and the accompanying notes thereto, all in reasonable detail, fairly
presenting the financial position and the results of the operations of Borrower,
Holdings, Parent and their respective subsidiaries as of the end of and for such
fiscal year, together with the opinion of independent certified public
accountants, which accountants shall be an independent accounting firm selected
by Borrower, Holdings or Parent, as applicable and reasonably acceptable to
Lender, that such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and present fairly the results of

22
<PAGE>
operations and financial condition of Borrower, Holdings, Parent and their
respective subsidiaries as of the end of and for the fiscal year then ended.

(b) Concurrently with the delivery to Lender of Borrower's financial

year and the calculation thereof and (ii) the amount of Borrower's Capital
Expenditures during such applicable fiscal quarter and year and the calculation
thereof.

(c) Borrower shall promptly notify Lender in writing of the details of (i)
any material loss, damage, investigation, action, suit, proceeding or claim
relating to the Collateral or any other property which is security for the
Obligations or which would result in any material adverse change in Borrower's,
Holdings' or Old PRN's business, properties, assets, goodwill or condition,
financial or otherwise and (ii) the occurrence of any Event of Default or event
which, with the passage of time or giving of notice or both, would constitute an
Event of Default.

(d) Borrower shall promptly after the sending or filing thereof furnish or
cause to be furnished to Lender copies of all reports which Borrower, Holdings,
Parent or Old PRN sends to its stockholders generally and copies of all reports
and registration statements which Borrower, Holdings, Parent or Old PRN files
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, any national securities exchange or
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

(e) Borrower shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Lender such budgets,
forecasts, projections and other information respecting the Collateral and the
business of Borrower, as Lender may, from time to time, reasonably request.
Lender is hereby authorized to deliver a copy of any financial statement or any
other information relating to the business of Borrower to (i), upon five (5)
business days notice to Borrower if there is no Event of Default or, if there is
an Event of Default, without notice, any court or other government agency or
(ii) any participant or assignee or (iii), after giving Borrower the name
thereof, any prospective participant or assignee. Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes and directs all accountants or auditors to deliver to Lender, at
Borrower's expense, copies of the financial statements of Borrower and any
reports or management letters prepared by such accountants or auditors on behalf
of Borrower and to disclose to Lender such information as they may have
regarding the business of Borrower. Any documents, schedules, invoices or other
papers delivered to Lender may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of by Lender
one (1) year after the same are delivered to Lender, except as otherwise
designated by Borrower to Lender in writing.

(f) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Lender, within one
hundred (100) days from the date hereof, opening balance sheets prepared by
Borrower and reviewed by independent certified public accountants, which
accountants shall be a nationally recognized independent accounting firm
selected by Borrower and reasonably acceptable to Lender to the effect that such
opening balance sheets have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and present
fairly the financial condition of Borrower as of such date, except that, in the

10.2 Remedies.

(a) At any time an Event of Default exists or has occurred and is
continuing, Lender shall have all rights and remedies provided in this
Agreement, the other Financing Agreements, the Uniform Commercial Code and other
applicable law, all of which rights and remedies may be exercised without notice
to or consent by Borrower or any Obligor, except as such notice or consent is
expressly provided for hereunder or required by applicable law. All rights,
remedies and powers granted to Lender hereunder, under any of the other
Financing Agreements, the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law, are
cumulative, not exclusive and enforceable, in Lender's discretion,
alternatively, successively, or concurrently on any one or more occasions, and
shall include, without limitation, the right to apply to a court of equity for
an injunction to restrain a breach or threatened breach by Borrower of this
Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements. Lender may, at any time or
times, proceed directly against Borrower or any Obligor to collect the
Obligations without prior recourse to the Collateral.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, at any time an Event of Default exists
or has occurred and is continuing, Lender may, in its discretion and without
limitation, (i) accelerate the payment of all Obligations and demand immediate
payment thereof to Lender (provided, that, upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default described in Sections 10.1(g) and 10.1(h), all Obligations shall
automatically become immediately due and payable), (ii) with or without judicial
process or the aid or assistance of others, enter upon any premises on or in
which any of the Collateral may be located and take possession of the Collateral
or complete processing, manufacturing and repair of all or any portion of the
Collateral, (iii) require Borrower, at Borrower's expense, to assemble and make
available to Lender any part or all of the Collateral at any place and time
designated by Lender, (iv) collect, foreclose, receive, appropriate, setoff and
realize upon any and all Collateral, (v) remove any or all of the Collateral
from any premises on or in which the same may be located for the purpose of
effecting the sale, foreclosure or other disposition thereof or for any other
purpose, (vi) sell, lease, transfer, assign, deliver or otherwise dispose of any
and all Collateral (including, without limitation, entering into contracts with
respect thereto, public or private sales at any exchange, broker's board, at any
office of Lender or elsewhere) at such prices or terms as Lender may deem
reasonable, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, with the Lender having
the right to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral at any such public
sale, all of the foregoing being free from any right or equity of redemption of
Borrower, which right or equity of redemption is hereby expressly waived and
released by Borrower and/or (vii) terminate this Agreement. If any of the
Collateral is sold or leased by Lender upon credit terms or for future delivery,
the Obligations shall not be reduced as a result thereof until payment therefor
is finally collected by Lender. If notice of disposition of Collateral is
required by law, ten (10) days prior notice by Lender to Borrower designating
the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale
or other intended disposition of Collateral is to be made, shall be deemed to be
reasonable notice thereof and Borrower waives any other notice. In the event
Lender institutes an action to recover any Collateral or seeks recovery of any
Collateral by way of prejudgment remedy, Borrower waives the posting of any bond
which might otherwise be required.

(c) Lender may apply the cash proceeds of Collateral actually received by
Lender from any sale, lease, foreclosure or other disposition of the Collateral
to payment of the Obligations, in whole or in part and in such order as Lender
may elect, whether or not then due. Borrower shall remain liable to

29

rate provided for herein and all costs and expenses of collection or

contract, equity or otherwise) for losses suffered by Borrower in connection
with, arising out of, or in any way related to the transactions or relationships
contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission or event occurring in
connection herewith, unless it is determined by a final and non-appealable
judgment or court order binding on Lender, that the losses were the result of
acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct. In any
such litigation, Lender shall be entitled to the benefit of the rebuttable
presumption that it acted in good faith and with the exercise of ordinary care
in the performance by it of the terms of this Agreement.

and this Agreement, except such as are expressly provided for herein. No notice

to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other
circumstances.

11.3 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement or the other Financing
Agreements nor any provision hereof or thereof shall be amended, modified,
waived or discharged orally or by course of conduct, but only by a written
agreement signed by an authorized officer of Lender. Lender shall not, by any
act, delay, omission or otherwise be deemed to have expressly or impliedly
waived any of its rights, powers and/or remedies unless such waiver shall be in
writing and signed by an authorized officer of Lender. Any such waiver shall be
enforceable only to the extent specifically set forth therein. A waiver by
Lender of any right, power and/or remedy on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right, power and/or remedy which
Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion, whether similar in kind or
otherwise.

11.4 Waiver of Counterclaims. Borrower waives all rights to interpose any
claims, deductions, setoffs or counterclaims of any nature (other then
compulsory counterclaims) in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, the other Financing Agreements, the Obligations, the Collateral or
any matter arising therefrom or relating hereto or thereto.

11.5 Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender, and its
directors, agents, employees and counsel, harmless from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses imposed on, incurred by
or asserted against any of them in connection with any litigation,
investigation, claim or proceeding commenced or threatened related to the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or
administration of this Agreement, the other Financing Agreements, or any
undertaking or proceeding related to any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or any act, omission, event or transaction related or attendant thereto,
including, without limitation, amounts paid in settlement, court costs, and the
fees and expenses of counsel, except as a result of Lender's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and
hold harmless set forth in this Section may be unenforceable because it violates
any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion which it is
permitted to pay under applicable law to Lender in satisfaction of indemnified
matters under this Section. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the payment of
the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement and the other Financing
Agreements.

12.3 Partial Invalidity. If any provision of this Agreement or the other
Financing Agreements is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
unenforceability shall not invalidate this Agreement and the other Financing
Agreements as a whole, but this Agreement and the other Financing Agreements

be construed and enforced only to such extent as shall be permitted by

sell participations in, all or any part of the Term Loan or any other interest

assignee or participant shall have, to the extent of such assignment or
participation, the same rights and benefits as it would have if it were the

or participation, and except that Lender will not sell any participations in the
Term Loan pursuant to which it does not continue to manage the Term Loan on
behalf of the participants.

12.5 Participant's Security Interest. If a Participant shall at any time
participate with Lender in the Loans or other Obligations, Borrower hereby

a continuing lien on and security interest in any money, securities and other
property of Borrower in the custody or possession of the Participant, including
the right of setoff, to the extent of the Participant's participation in the
Obligations, and such Participant shall be deemed to have the same right of
setoff to the extent of its participation in the Obligations, as it would have
if it were a direct lender.

12.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Financing Agreements, any
supplements hereto or thereto, and any instruments or documents delivered or to
be delivered in connection herewith or therewith represents the entire agreement
and understanding concerning the subject matter hereof and thereof between the
parties hereto, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, representations, warranties, commitments,
proposals, offers and contracts concerning the subject matter hereof, whether

NOTE AGREEMENT

Re:

$10,000,000 Senior Subordinated Notes
Due October 1, 2004

Dated as of
September 30, 1994

To the Purchasers named in
Schedule I attached to
this Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, PRN Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
'Company'), agrees with the purchasers named on Schedule I to this Agreement
(the 'Purchasers') as follows:

SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION OF NOTES AND COMMITMENT.

Section 1.1. Description of Notes. The Company will authorize the issue and
sale of $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Subordinated Notes
due October 1, 2004 (the 'Notes'). The Notes shall be (i) dated the date of
issue, (ii) expressed to bear interest prior to maturity at the rate of 10.00%
per annum (subject to adjustment as set forth below) payable semiannually on the
first day of each April and October in each year commencing April 1, 1995, and
at maturity, (iii) expressed to bear interest on overdue principal (including
any overdue required or optional prepayment of principal) and premium, if any,
and (to the extent legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest
at the Overdue Rate after the date due, whether by acceleration or otherwise,
until paid, (iv) expressed to mature on October 1, 2004, (v) subordinate and
junior to Senior Debt of the Company as provided in Section 8 and (vi) otherwise
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. The interest rate borne
by the Notes shall be increased upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i)
if the Company shall deliver an OID Adjustment Notice the interest rate borne by
the Notes shall be increased by 25 basis points (.25%) per annum effective as of
the Closing Date, and (ii) if an IPO Adjustment Date shall occur the interest
rate borne by the Notes shall be increased by 300 basis points (3.00%) per annum
effective as of the IPO Adjustment Date. Interest on the Notes shall be computed
on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed. The term Notes as used
herein shall include each Note delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

The Notes are not subject to prepayment or redemption at the option of the
Company prior to their expressed maturity dates except on the terms and
conditions and in the amounts and with the premium, if any, set forth in
Section 2 of this Agreement.

The payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will
be guaranteed by New PRN, a Wholly-owned Subsidiary (the 'Guarantor'), for the
benefit of the Holders pursuant to a Senior Subordinated Subsidiary Guaranty
Agreement dated as of the date hereof, in the form of Exhibit F hereto (the
'Subordinated Guaranty').

Section 1.2. Commitment; Closing Date. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and on the basis of the representations and warranties hereinafter set
forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each Purchaser, and such
Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company, Notes of the Company in the
aggregate principal amount set forth opposite such Purchaser's name in Schedule
I at a price of 100% of the principal amount thereof on the Closing Date
mentioned below. The aggregate purchase price for the Notes and the Warrants
referred to in Section 1.3 to be purchased by each Purchaser shall not exceed an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite
such Purchaser's name in Schedule I.
<PAGE>
Delivery of the Notes and Warrants will be made at the offices of
Otterbourg, Steindler, Houston & Rosen, P.C., 230 Park Avenue, New York, New
York 10169, against payment therefor in Federal Reserve or other funds current
and immediately available and wired to such account at such bank in the
continental United States as the Company shall direct in a written notice given
to the Purchasers in the amount of the purchase price at 11:00 A.M. Eastern
time, on September 30, 1994 or such later date (not later than October 19, 1994)
as shall mutually be agreed upon by the Company and the Purchasers (the 'Closing
Date'). The Notes will be delivered to each Purchaser in the form of a single
registered Note, registered in such Purchaser's name or in the name of such
Purchaser's nominee as such Purchaser may specify at any time prior to the date
fixed for delivery.

Section 1.3. Warrants to Purchase Common Stock. In consideration of, and as
an inducement to, each Purchaser's obligation to purchase the Notes, the Company
also agrees to deliver to each Purchaser on the Closing Date warrants (all
warrants being delivered to the Purchasers being referred to collectively as the
'Warrants') substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B to purchase
shares of Common Stock of the Company. The number of shares which may be
purchased upon the exercise of the Warrants and the price per share are subject
to adjustment in the manner and on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Warrants.

The Company and the Purchasers agree that for U.S. federal income tax
purposes the aggregate amount of original issue discount is less than a de
minimus amount (as defined in the Treasury Regulations). Unless an OID
Adjustment Notice (as hereinafter defined) is delivered to the Purchasers, the
Company agrees to use the foregoing determination for U.S. federal income tax
purposes with respect to this transaction. In the event that the Company shall
in good faith determine that the original issue discount attributable to the
Notes is more than the de minimus amount (as defined in the Treasury
Regulations), the Company shall give written notice of such determination (an
'OID Adjustment Notice') to the Purchasers. Such determination shall be
supported by a written opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor which shall
set forth the basis for such determination in reasonable detail. Any such
determination shall be made by and communicated to the Purchasers on or prior to
December 31, 1994. The Company covenants and agrees with the Purchasers that in
no event will the original issue discount attributable to the Notes exceed
$2,000,000.

The rights, powers and terms of and relating to the Common Stock will be
provided for in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation as in effect on the
Closing Date, and as otherwise provided by the general corporation law of the
State of Delaware.

Section 1.4. Several Commitments. The obligations of the Purchasers shall
be several and not joint and no Purchaser shall be liable or responsible for the
acts or defaults of any other Purchaser.

SECTION 2. PREPAYMENT OF NOTES.

Section 2.1. Required Prepayments of Notes. The Company agrees that on the
first day of each April and October in each year, commencing April 1, 2000 and
ending April 1, 2004, both inclusive, it will prepay and apply and there shall
become due and payable on the principal indebtedness evidenced by the Notes an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000,000 or (ii) the principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding. The entire remaining principal amount of the Notes shall
become due and payable on October 1, 2004. No premium shall be payable in
connection with any required prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.1. For
purposes of this Section 2.1, any prepayment of less than all of the outstanding
Notes pursuant to Section 2.2 shall reduce the amount of each subsequent
scheduled principal payment on the Notes pursuant to this Section 2.1 in the 
same proportion that the principal amount of such prepayment pursuant to 
Section 2.2 bears to the unpaid principal amount of the Notes immediately prior
to such prepayment.

In the event any portion of the Notes is applied to the payment of the
purchase price of Common Stock as contemplated in Section 1 of the Warrants, the
amount so applied shall be deemed to constitute payment of the principal amount
of the Notes scheduled to remain unpaid on October 1, 2004, and then, to the
remaining scheduled principal prepayments in inverse chronological order.

Section 2.2. Optional Prepayments. In addition to the payments required by
Section 2.1, upon compliance with Section 2.4, the Company shall have the
privilege, at any time and from time to time, on or after, but not prior to,
October 1, 1997, of prepaying the outstanding Notes, either in whole or in
<PAGE>
part (but if in part then in a minimum principal amount of $500,000 or any
integral multiple thereof) by payment of the principal amount of the Notes, or
portion thereof to be prepaid, and accrued interest thereon to the date of such
prepayment, together with a premium equal to the principal amount of the Notes
being so prepaid multiplied by the applicable premium set forth opposite the
applicable period below:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
IF PREPAID DURING THE 12-MONTH
PERIOD COMMENCING OCTOBER 1
IN THE YEAR: APPLICABLE PREMIUM
1997 4%
1998 3%
1999 2%
2000 1%
2001 and thereafter 0%
</TABLE>

Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Section 2.2 if the 
Company shall complete an IPO within two years of the Closing Date, the Company
may prepay, upon compliance with Section 2.4 and without premium, 35% of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes at any time or from time to
time during the two year period immediately subsequent to such IPO.

Section 2.3. Prepayment upon Designated Event. In the event the Company has
knowledge of a Designated Event or an impending Designated Event, the Company
will give written notice (a 'Company Notice') of such fact to all Holders at
least 30 days prior to any proposed Designated Event Date; provided, however,
that if the Company shall not then have knowledge of such fact, such Company
Notice shall be delivered promptly after the Company shall have knowledge of
such fact, but in no event later than three business days after the Designated
Event Date. The Company Notice shall (i) describe the facts and circumstances of
such Designated Event in reasonable detail (including the Designated Event Date
or proposed Designated Event Date), (ii) make reference to this Section 2.3 and
the rights of the Holders to require the Company to prepay their Notes, (iii)
state that the Holder must make a declaration of its intent to have the Notes
held by it prepaid, and (iv) specify the date upon which such prepayment will be
made (the 'Designated Event Payment Date'). The Designated Event Payment Date
shall occur not less than 20 days nor more than 30 days after the Designated
Event Date, provided that the Holders of 66-2/3% in aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Notes may designate an earlier date (but not earlier than the
date upon which the Designated Event shall occur) by written notice delivered to
the Company pursuant to the Declaration Notice (as hereinafter defined).

Upon the receipt of such Company Notice or, if no Company Notice is given,
upon receipt of actual knowledge of a Designated Event, any Holder shall have
the privilege, upon written notice (the 'Declaration Notice') to the Company, of
declaring all Notes held by such Holder serving such Declaration Notice to
become due and payable on the Designated Event Payment Date or, if such notice
is given as a result of the failure of the Company to deliver a Company Notice,
on the date designated by such Holder (which shall be not earlier than the
Designated Event Date). In the event that a Company Notice is given and a Holder
fails to provide a Declaration Notice on or prior to the fifth business day
preceding the Designated Event Payment Date, the Notes held by such Holder shall
not become due and payable as a result of such Designated Event.

Acquiring Person: any Person or group of two or more Persons acting as a
partnership, limited partnership, syndicate, or other group for the purpose of
acquiring, holding or disposing of Voting Stock of the Company, together with
all affiliates and associates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of such Person or Persons, but excluding
Bernard J. Korman and/or a trust (the 'Rotko Trust') created pursuant to an
Agreement of Trust, dated November 18, l983, for the benefit, during her
lifetime, of Bessie G. Rotko, and the Trustees of the Rotko Trust, which are
Bessie G. Rotko, Michael J. Rotko, Judith M. Shipon, Lionel Felzer and PNC Bank,
N.A. (formerly Provident National Bank), together all affiliates and associates
of the foregoing Persons.

Designated Event: shall be deemed to have occurred on the date on which an
Acquiring Person shall have acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, legal or
beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Voting
Stock of the Company.
<PAGE>
Designated Event Date: any date upon which a Designated Event shall occur.

All prepayments on the Notes pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be made by
the payment of the aggregate principal amount remaining unpaid on such Notes and
accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment, together with a premium
equal to the premium which would have been payable if the Notes had been prepaid
in accordance with Section 2.2, determined as of the Designated Event Payment
Date, provided that if the Designated Event Payment Date shall occur prior to
October 1, 1997, the amount of such premium shall equal 6% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes being prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.3. Any
prepayment of less than all of the outstanding Notes made pursuant to this
Section 2.3 shall be applied to the payment in full of the Notes held by the
Holders providing a Declaration Notice, and each scheduled prepayment pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2.1 coming due thereafter shall be reduced by an
amount which bears the same relationship to such payment as the aggregate amount
being so applied pursuant to this Section 2.3 bears to the unpaid principal
amount of the Notes immediately prior to such application, so that the amounts
of the scheduled payments on each Note remaining outstanding after such
application shall be unchanged by such application.

Section 2.4. Notice of Prepayments. The Company shall give written notice
of any prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 2.2 to each Holder not less
than 25 days nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for such optional
prepayment. Such notice shall specify (i) such date, (ii) the principal amount
of the Holder's Notes to be prepaid and the aggregate principal amount of all
Notes to be prepaid, (iii) the premium, if any, and (iv) the accrued interest
applicable to the prepayment. Such notice of prepayment shall also set forth
sufficient information to establish satisfaction of all conditions precedent to
any such prepayment. Notice of prepayment having been given in accordance with
this Section 2.4, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes specified in such
notice, together with the premium, if any, and accrued interest thereon shall
become due and payable on the prepayment date.

Section 2.5. Allocation of Prepayments. All partial prepayments of the
Notes pursuant to Section Section 2.1 and 2.2 shall be applied on all 
outstanding Notes ratably among all Holders in accordance with the unpaid 
principal amount of the Notes outstanding; provided, however, that solely for 
purposes of allocating partial prepayments of the Notes under Section 2.1, the
principal amount of any Note which has been applied against the purchase price
of Common Stock as contemplated in Section 1 of the Warrants shall be deemed to
be outstanding.

Section 2.6. Direct Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or the Notes, in the case of any Note owned by any Holder that is
a Purchaser or any other Institutional Holder which has given written notice to
the Company requesting that the provisions of this Section shall apply, the
Company will punctually pay all sums becoming due without any presentment
thereof directly to such Holder at its address set forth herein or at such other
address as such Holder may from time to time designate in writing to the Company
in accordance with Section 11.6 or, if a bank account is so designated for such
Holder, the Company will make such payments to such bank account by initiating
such payment before 11:00 A.M., New York time, by bank wire transfer in
immediately available funds, marked for attention as indicated, or in such other
manner or to such other account of such Holder in any bank in the United States
as such Holder may from time to time direct in writing.

Any Holder to which this Section 2.6 applies agrees that in the event it
shall sell or transfer any Note (i) it will, prior to the delivery of such Note
(unless it has already done so), make a notation thereon of all principal, if
any, prepaid on such Note and will also note thereon the date to which interest
has been paid on such Note, and (ii) it will promptly notify the Company of the
name and address of the transferee of any Note so transferred. With respect to
Notes to which this Section 2.6 applies, the Company shall be entitled to 
presume conclusively that the original or such subsequent Holder as shall have 
requested the provisions hereof to apply to its Notes remains the Holder of 
such Notes until (i) the Company shall have received notice in writing of the 
transfer of such Notes, and of the name and address of the transferee, or (ii) 
such Notes shall have been presented to the Company as evidence of the transfer.

SECTION 3. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION.

Section 3.1. Financial and Business Information. The Company agrees to
furnish (x) to each Purchaser so long as it or its nominee is a Holder and to
each other Institutional Holder of the then

not:

(a) Declare or pay any dividends, either in cash or property, on any
shares of its capital stock of any class (except dividends or other
distributions payable solely in shares of Common Stock of the Company); or

Parent;

(such declarations or payments of dividends, purchases, redemptions or
retirements of capital stock and warrants, rights or options and all such other
distributions and Management Fees being herein collectively called 'Restricted
Payments'), if after giving effect thereto any Default or Event of
<PAGE>
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or the aggregate amount of
Restricted Payments made or declared during the period from and after October 1,
1994, to and including the date of the making of the Restricted Payment in
question, would exceed 50% of Consolidated Net Income for such period, computed

is a deficit figure, then minus 100% of such deficit).

The Company will not declare any dividend which constitutes a Restricted
Payment payable more than 60 days after the date of declaration thereof.

For the purposes of this Section 4.7, the amount of any Restricted Payment 
declared, paid or distributed in property of the Company shall be deemed to be 
the greater of the book value or fair market value (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors of the Company) of such property at the time of the 
making of the Restricted Payment in question.

Section 4.8. Merger or Consolidation. The Company will not, and will not

or any Wholly-owned Subsidiary so long as in any merger or consolidation
involving the Company, the Company shall be the surviving or continuing
corporation; and

outstanding during the applicable period of the entity with which the

Section 4.9. Sale of Assets. The Company will not, and will not permit any

of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided,
however, that (i) any Subsidiary may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or
any part of its assets to the Company or a Wholly-owned Subsidiary and (ii) the
Company and its Subsidiaries may dispose of assets in the ordinary course of
business.

As used in this Section 4.9, a sale, lease or other disposition of assets
shall be deemed to be a 'substantial part' of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries if the book value of such assets, when added to the book value of
all other assets sold, leased or otherwise disposed of by the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than in the ordinary course of business) during the 12-month
period ending with the date of such sale, lease or other disposition, exceeds
15% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries determined on a
consolidated basis as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. For
purposes of calculations pursuant to this Section 4.9, the sale or other
disposition of equipment which is worn out, obsolete or no longer suitable for
use in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
constitute dispositions in the ordinary course of business.

Section 4.10. Sale of Subsidiary Stock and Debt. (a) The Company will not
permit any Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of such Subsidiary's capital
stock (including as 'stock' for the purposes of this Section 4.10 any warrants,

Wholly-owned Subsidiary, (ii) to directors for qualifying shares, (iii) to
satisfy the validly pre-existing preemptive rights of minority shareholders in
connection with the simultaneous issuance of stock to the Company and/or a
Subsidiary whereby the Company and/or such Subsidiary maintain their same
proportionate interest in such Subsidiary, and (iv) to satisfy the requirement
of the Warrant dated as of May 29, l992 originally issued to Internationale
Nederlanden (U.S.) Finance Corporation pursuant to which 2.5% of the common

warrant as in effect on the Closing Date) may be issued.

(b) The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of capital stock or any Debt of any
Subsidiary, unless (i) simultaneously with
<PAGE>
such sale, transfer or disposition, all shares of capital stock and all Debt of
such Subsidiary at the time owned by the Company and other Subsidiaries shall be
sold, transferred or disposed of as an entirety, (ii) the Subsidiary being
disposed of shall not have any continuing Investment in the Company or any other
Subsidiary, (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined,
as evidenced by a resolution of the Board, that the retention of such stock and
Debt is no longer in the best interests of the Company, (iv) such stock and Debt
are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to a Person for a cash
consideration and on terms reasonably deemed by the Board of Directors to be
adequate and satisfactory, and (v) such sale, transfer or disposition is
permitted by Section 4.9.

Subsidiary, rated AA or better by Standard & Poor's Corporation or Aa or
better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

officers and employees incidental to carrying on the business of the

of such Subsidiary.

<PAGE>
Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate repurchases any Notes, such Notes shall
thereafter be cancelled and no Notes shall be issued in substitution therefor.

continuing, any Holder may, and when any Event of Default described in 
paragraphs (c) through (i), inclusive, of Section 5.1 has happened and is 
continuing, the Holder or Holders holding 50% or more of the principal amount
of the outstanding Notes may, by notice in writing sent by registered or 
certified mail to the Company, declare the principal of the Notes to be, and
all principal of and interest on all outstanding Notes shall thereupon

all expenses incurred by them in the collection of any Notes upon any default
hereunder or thereon, including reasonable compensation to such Holder's or

and
<PAGE>
(c) each and every other Default and Event of Default shall have been
made good, cured or waived pursuant to Section 6.1;

in writing of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Notes; provided that without the written consent of all of the
Holders, no such waiver, modification, alteration or amendment shall be

extend to or affect any obligation not expressly amended or waived or impair any
right consequent thereon.

or negotiate for or with respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of
the provisions of this Agreement or the Notes unless each Holder (irrespective
of the amount of Notes then owned by it) shall be concurrently informed thereof
by the Company and shall be afforded the opportunity of considering the same and
shall be supplied by the Company with sufficient information to enable it to
make an informed decision with respect thereto. Executed or true and correct

Section 6 shall be delivered by the Company to each Holder forthwith following

for or as an inducement to the consideration or review of or entering into by

Its

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Company represents and warrants to each Purchaser as follows:

1. Subsidiaries. Annex A attached hereto states the name of each of the
Company's Subsidiaries, its jurisdiction of incorporation and the percentage of
its Voting Stock owned by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries. The Company and
each Subsidiary has good and marketable title to all of the shares it purports
to own of the stock of each Subsidiary, free and clear in each case of any lien
except for liens created pursuant to the Credit Agreement. All such shares have
been duly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

2. Corporate Organization and Authority. The Company, and each Subsidiary,

(a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation;

(b) has all requisite power and authority and all necessary licenses
and permits to own and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted except where the
failure to have any such licenses or permits would not materially and
adversely affect the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and

(c) is duly licensed or qualified and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction wherein the nature of the business
transacted by it or the nature of the property owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not materially and adversely affect the
condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and such Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

3. Authorized Capital Stock. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 2,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 per share par value, of which
1,000 shares are outstanding on the date hereof and all of said outstanding
shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The
Company does not have outstanding any warrants, options, Convertible Securities
or other rights for the purchase or acquisition of shares of its Common Stock.
The Board of Directors of the Company has duly reserved for issuance upon
exercise of the Warrants 10% of the Pro Forma Shares (as defined in the Warrant)
of Common Stock. No shareholder of the Company or any other Person is entitled
to preemptive or similar rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock which
are issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and, if and when issued upon exercise
of the Warrants in accordance with the provisions thereof, such shares will be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares.

4. Financial Statements. (a) The balance sheet of Old PRN in each of the
fiscal years 1991 through 1993, inclusive, and the related statements of income,
shareholders' equity and changes in financial position or cash flows for the
fiscal years ended on said 

EXHIBIT C
(to Note Agreement)
<PAGE>

dates, each accompanied by a report thereon containing an opinion unqualified 
as to scope limitations imposed by Old PRN and otherwise without qualification 
by Deloitte & Touche (or its predecessors) have been prepared in accordance 
with GAAP consistently applied except as therein noted, are correct and 
complete in all material respects and present fairly the financial position 
of Old PRN as of such dates and the results of its operations and changes 
in its financial position or cash flows for such periods. The unaudited 
balance sheet of Old PRN as of June 30, 1994 and the related statements 
of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the nine-month period 
then ended have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, 
are correct and complete in all material respects and present fairly the 
financial position of Old PRN as of such date and the results of its 
operations and changes in its financial position or cash flows for such periods
subject to year-end audit adjustments.

(b) Since June 30, 1994, there has been no change in the condition,
financial or otherwise, of Old PRN as shown on the balance sheet as of such
date except changes in the ordinary course of business, none of which
individually or in the aggregate has been materially adverse to Old PRN.

5. Full Disclosure. Neither the financial statements referred to in
paragraph 4, nor the representations and warranties set forth herein, nor any
other written statement furnished to any Purchaser by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with the negotiation of the sale of the Notes and
Warrants, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omit a material
fact necessary to make the statements contained therein or herein not
misleading. To the best knowledge of the Company, there is no fact peculiar to
the Company or its Subsidiaries which the Company has not disclosed to each
Purchaser in writing which materially affects adversely or, so far as the
Company can now reasonably foresee, will materially affect adversely the
properties, business, prospects, profits or condition (financial or otherwise)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

6. Sale is Legal and Authorized. The sale of the Notes and Warrants and
compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Agreement, the Notes
and Warrants:

(a) are within the corporate powers of the Company;

(b) will not violate any provisions of any law or any order of any
court or governmental authority or agency and will not conflict with or
result in any breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a default under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
the Company or any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the
Company or the Parent is a party or by which it may be bound or result in
the imposition of any liens or encumbrances on any property of the Company;
and

(c) have been duly authorized by proper corporate action on the part
of the Company (no action by the shareholders of the Company being required
by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or
otherwise), executed and delivered by the Company and the Agreement, the
Notes and the Warrants constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations,
contracts and agreements of the Company enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms.

7. Indebtedness. Annex B attached hereto correctly describes all Debt and
Long-Term Leases of the Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding on September
30, 1994.

8. Governmental Consent. No approval, consent or withholding of objection
on the part of any regulatory body, state, Federal or local, is necessary in
connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Agreement, the
Notes or the Warrants or compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of
the Agreement, the Notes or the Warrants.

9. Use of Proceeds. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes and
Warrants will be used by the Company to make a capital contribution to New PRN
in the amount of $10,000,000 for the purpose of enabling New PRN to consummate
the acquisition described in the Asset Purchase Agreement. None of the
transactions contemplated in the Agreement (including, without limitation
thereof, the use of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and Warrants) will
violate or result in a violation of Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or any regulation issued pursuant thereto, including, without
limitation, Regulations G, T and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, 12 C.F.R., Chapter II. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
owns or intends to carry or purchase any 'margin stock' within the meaning of
said Regulation G. None of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes or the
Warrants will be used to purchase, or refinance any borrowing the
<PAGE>
proceeds of which were used to purchase, any 'security' within the meaning of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

10. Private Offering. Neither the Company, directly or indirectly, nor any
agent on its behalf has offered or will offer the Notes or Warrants or any
similar Security to or has solicited or will solicit an offer to acquire the
Notes or Warrants or any similar Security from or has otherwise approached or
negotiated or will approach or negotiate in respect of the Notes or Warrants or
any similar Security with any person other than the Purchasers. Neither the
Company, directly or indirectly, nor any agent on its behalf has offered or will
offer the Notes or Warrants or any similar Security to or has solicited or will
solicit an offer to acquire the Notes or Warrants or any similar Security from
any person so as to bring the issuance and sale of the Notes and Warrants within
the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

11. No Defaults. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. The Company is not in default in the payment of principal or
interest on any Funded Debt or Current Debt or in default under any instrument
or instruments or agreements under and subject to which any Funded Debt or
Current Debt has been issued and no event has occurred and is continuing under
the provisions of any such instrument or agreement which with the lapse of time
or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an event of default
thereunder.

12. Pending Litigation. There are no proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or its
Subsidiaries in any court or before any governmental authority or arbitration
board or tribunal which involve the reasonable probability of materially and
adversely affecting the properties, business, prospects, profits or condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Company or its Subsidiaries or which might
affect the ability of the Company to enter into the Agreement or to sell the
Notes or Warrants. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default with
respect to any order of any court or governmental authority or arbitration board
or tribunal.

13. Title to Properties. The Company and each Subsidiary has good
title in fee simple (or its equivalent under applicable law) to all the real
property and has good title to all the other property it purports to own,
including that reflected in the most recent balance sheet referred to in
paragraph 5, except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business and liens securing Debt described in Annex B to Exhibit B.

14. Patents and Trademarks. The Company and each Subsidiary owns or
possesses all the patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights,
licenses and rights with respect to the foregoing which are material to the
present and planned future conduct of its business, without any known conflict
with the rights of others.

15. Taxes. All tax returns required to be filed by the Company or any
Subsidiary with the Federal government and with any other jurisdiction have, in
fact, been filed. All taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges
upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon any of their respective properties,
income or franchises, which are shown to be due and payable in such returns have
been paid. For all taxable years ending on or before September 30, 1988, the
Federal income tax liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been
satisfied and either the period of limitations on assessment of additional
Federal income tax has expired or the Company and its Subsidiaries have entered
into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service closing conclusively the
total tax liability for the taxable year. The Company does not know of any
proposed additional tax assessment against it for which adequate provision has
not been made on its accounts and no material controversy in respect of
additional Federal or state income taxes due since said date is pending or to
the knowledge of the Company threatened. The provision for taxes on the books of
the Company is adequate for all open years, and for its current fiscal period.

16. ERISA. Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable
statutes and governmental rules and regulations, and (a) no Reportable Event has
occurred and is continuing with respect to any Plan, (b) neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has withdrawn from any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or
instituted steps to do so, and (c) no steps have been instituted to terminate
any Plan. No condition exists or event or transaction has occurred in connection
with any Plan which could result in the incurrence by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of any material liability, fine or penalty. No Plan maintained by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate, nor any trust created thereunder,
<PAGE>
has incurred any 'accumulated funding deficiency' as defined in Section 302 of
ERISA nor does the present value of all benefits vested under all Plans exceed,
as of the last annual valuation date, the value of the assets of the Plans
allocable to such vested benefits. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any contingent liability with respect to any post-retirement 'welfare
benefit plan' (as such term is defined in ERISA) except as has been disclosed to
the Purchasers.

17. Compliance with Law. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (a) is in
violation of any law, ordinance, franchise, governmental rule or regulation to
which it is subject or (b) has failed to obtain any license, permit, franchise
or other governmental authorization necessary to the ownership of its property
or to the conduct of its business, which violation or failure to obtain would
materially adversely affect the business, prospects, profits, properties or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
contained in the Agreement, the Notes or the Warrants. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any order of any court or
governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal.

18. Compliance with Environmental Laws. The Company is not in violation of
any applicable Federal, state, or local laws, statutes, rules, regulations or
ordinances relating to public health, safety or the environment, including,
without limitation, relating to releases, discharges, emissions or disposals to
air, water, land or ground water, to the withdrawal or use of ground water, to
the use, handling or disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos or
urea formaldehyde, to the treatment, storage, disposal or management of
hazardous substances (including, without limitation, petroleum, crude oil or any
fraction thereof, or other hydrocarbons), pollutants or contaminants, to
exposure to toxic, hazardous or other controlled, prohibited or regulated
substances which violation could have a material adverse effect on the business,
prospects, profits, properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company does not know of any
liability or class of liability of the Company or any Subsidiary under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as
amended (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq.), or the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.).

19. Solvency. On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by the Note Agreement, (a) the present fair saleable value of the
assets of the Company on a going concern basis is in excess of the total amount
of its liabilities (including for purposes of this definition all liabilities,
whether or not reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP,
and whether direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured,
disputed or undisputed); (b) the Company will be able to pay its debts and
obligations as they mature in the ordinary course of its business as proposed to
be conducted; and (c) the Company does not have unreasonably small capital to
carry out its business as proposed to be conducted. For the purpose of this
paragraph 19, 'present fair saleable value' means the value which would be
realized from an interested purchaser aware of all relevant information relating
to the assets or group of assets being sold and who is willing to purchase under
ordinary selling conditions in an existing and not theoretical market if the
assets or group of assets are disposed of within a period of six months to one
year.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL'S CLOSING OPINION

The closing opinion of Chapman and Cutler, special counsel to the
Purchasers, called for by Section 12.2 of the Note Agreement, shall be dated the
Closing Date and addressed to the Purchasers, shall be satisfactory in form and
substance to the Purchasers and shall be to the effect that:

1. The Company is a corporation, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the corporate power and
the corporate authority to execute and deliver the Note Agreement and
Warrants and to issue the Notes, and to issue its shares of Common Stock
upon exercise of the Warrants.

2. The Note Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
contract of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, and general principles of equity (regardless
of whether the application of such principles is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

3. The Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, and the Notes being delivered on the
date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company
enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of whether
the application of such principles is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

4. The Warrants have been duly authorized by proper corporate action
on the part of the Company, have been duly executed by authorized officers
of the Company and delivered and constitute the legal, valid and binding
contracts and agreements of the Company enforceable in accordance with
their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and general principles
of equity (regardless of whether the application of such principles is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), provided that no opinion
is expressed as to whether the enforcement of the indemnity provisions of
Section 9.9 of the Warrants may be limited under certain circumstances by
public policy considerations.

5. The issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes and Warrants under the
circumstances contemplated by the Note Agreement do not, under existing
law, require the registration of the Notes or Warrants under the Securities
Act, or the qualification of an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended.

EXHIBIT D
(to Note Agreement)
<PAGE>

The opinion of Chapman and Cutler shall also state that the opinion of Alan
S. Einhorn and Steve J. Feder is satisfactory in scope and form to Chapman and
Cutler and that, in their opinion, the Purchasers are justified in relying
thereon.

In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph 1 above, Chapman and Cutler
may rely, as to matters referred to in paragraph 1, solely upon an examination
of the Certificate of Incorporation certified by, and a certificate of good
standing of the Company from, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
the Bylaws of the Company and the general business corporation law of the State
of Delaware.

With respect to matters of fact upon which such opinion is based, Chapman
and Cutler may rely on appropriate certificates of public officials and officers
of the Company and upon representations of the Company and the Purchasers
delivered in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes.

Agreement and Warrants and to issue the Notes and has the full corporate
power and the corporate authority to conduct the activities in which it is

has the full corporate power and authority to execute and perform the
Subsidiary Guaranty and has the full corporate power and authority to

qualified and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the

the Company and such Subsidiaries taken as a whole. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of each such Subsidiary have been duly
issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by the Company.

3. The Note Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary

delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
contract of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject

of whether the application of such principles is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

4. The Warrants have been duly authorized by proper corporate action
on the part of the Company, have been duly executed by authorized officers
of the Company and delivered and constitute the legal, valid and binding
contracts and agreements of the Company enforceable in accordance with
their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and

provisions of Section 9.8 of the Warrants may be limited under certain 
circumstances by public policy considerations.

5. The Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, and the Notes being delivered on the
date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company

accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and
general principles of equity (regardless of whether the application of such
principles is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

7. No approval, consent or withholding of objection on the part of, or
filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental body, Federal
or state, is necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of the
Note Agreement, the Notes or the Warrants.

8. The issuance and sale of the Notes and Warrants and the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of the Note Agreement and Warrants
do not conflict with or result in any breach of any of the provisions of or
constitute a default under or result in the creation or imposition of any
lien upon any of the property of the Company pursuant to the provisions of
the
<PAGE>
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any agreement or
other instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or
by which the Company may be bound.

circumstances contemplated by the Note Agreement do not, under existing
law, require the registration of the Notes or Warrants under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the qualification of an indenture under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

10. The Company has duly authorized Common Stock consisting of 2,000

have been issued and are outstanding. All such outstanding shares have been
duly and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

11. The Underlying Shares when issued in accordance with the terms of
the Warrants will be duly authorized, fully paid, validly issued and

Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any
regulation issued pursuant thereto, or Regulations G, T and X of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R., Chap. II.

WARRANT TO PURCHASE

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OF

PRN HOLDINGS, INC.

Void after October 1, 2004

This is to certify that, for value received and subject to the provisions
hereinafter set forth,

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company
or assigns,

is entitled to purchase from PRN Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
'Company'), at any time to and including 5 P.M. E.D.T. October 1, 2004 (the
'Expiration Date'), Common Stock of the Company of the par value of $.01 per
share, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

The exercise price for each share of Common Stock to be issued to the
holder of this Warrant upon the exercise of this Warrant is $.01 per share and
shall not be subject to adjustment. The number of shares of Common Stock to be
received by the holder of this Warrant upon the exercise of this Warrant in
whole equals the number of Pro Forma Shares determined as of the date of
exercise of this Warrant multiplied by the Original Applicable Percentage of
this Warrant (or if this Warrant has been previously exercised in part,
multiplied by the Applicable Percentage for this Warrant then in effect). The
number of shares of Common Stock to be received by the holder of this Warrant
upon the exercise in part of this Warrant equals the number of Pro Forma Shares
determined as of the date of exercise of this Warrant multiplied by the portion
of the Original Applicable Percentage of this Warrant (or if this Warrant has
been previously exercised in part, multiplied by the Applicable Percentage for
this Warrant then in effect) designated by the holder of this Warrant.

The terms which are capitalized herein shall have the meanings specified 
in Section 11 unless the context shall otherwise require.

SECTION 1. EXERCISE OF WARRANT.

Subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, prior to the Expiration
Date this Warrant may be exercised (i) for all shares of Common Stock which may
then be purchased hereunder, and (ii) for any part of the shares of Common Stock
which may then be purchased hereunder on not more than two occasions. Upon any
such exercise, the holder shall surrender this Warrant (with the subscription
form at the end hereof duly executed) at the principal office of the Company in
Pennsauken, New Jersey, and shall pay to the Company the price per share for the
shares so purchased in funds current in Pennsauken, New Jersey. In the event the
number of Underlying Shares or Restricted Shares which the holder of this
Warrant is permitted to register pursuant to Section 9.4 or 9.6 is reduced in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.7, any partial exercise resulting
from such reduction shall not be included for purposes of the limitation on the
right to exercise this Warrant set forth in the preceding sentence. If this
Warrant is exercised in respect of less than all of the shares of said Common
Stock at the time purchasable hereunder, the holder hereof shall be entitled to
receive a new Warrant covering the Applicable Percentage of Common Stock in
respect of which this Warrant shall not have been exercised; provided, however,
that this Warrant and all rights and options hereunder shall expire on the
Expiration Date, and shall be wholly null and void to the extent this Warrant is
not exercised before it expires.

SECTION 2. RESERVATION OF COMMON STOCK.
<PAGE>
The Company covenants and agrees that at all times prior to the Expiration
Date it will have authorized, and in reserve, a sufficient number of shares of
its Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by the
unexercised portion of this Warrant.

SECTION 3. MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, SALES.

In the case of any consolidation or merger of the Company with another
entity, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to another entity,
or any reorganization or reclassification of the Common Stock or other equity
securities of the Company, then, as a condition of such consolidation, merger,
sale, reorganization or reclassification, lawful and adequate provision shall be
made whereby the holder of this Warrant shall thereafter have the right to
receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in
lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore purchasable hereunder
such shares of stock, securities or assets as may (by virtue of such
consolidation, merger, sale, reorganization or reclassification) be issued or
payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock immediately
theretofore so purchasable hereunder had such consolidation, merger, sale,
reorganization or reclassification not taken place; provided that if securities
which are not traded on a National Securities Exchange are issued to holders of
Common Stock in any such transaction (excluding a merger in which the Company
shall be the survivor) then at the election of the holder in lieu of such
securities the holder hereof shall be entitled to receive cash equal to the fair
market value of the securities which such Holder is entitled to receive. The
fair market value of such securities shall be determined by a nationally
recognized investment banking firm reasonably satisfactory to the holder. The
cost of any such determination shall be borne by the Company. The Company shall
not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale, unless prior to or
simultaneously with the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other
than the Company) resulting from such consolidation or merger or the entity
purchasing such assets shall assume by written instrument executed and mailed or
delivered to the holder of this Warrant, the obligation to deliver to such
holder such shares of stock, securities, cash or other assets as, in accordance
with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to receive.

SECTION 4. DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.

In the event of any proposed distribution of the assets of the Company in
dissolution or liquidation except under circumstances when the foregoing Section
3 shall be applicable, the Company shall mail notice thereof to the holder of
this Warrant and shall make no distribution to shareholders until the expiration
of 20 days from the date of mailing of the aforesaid notice and, in any such
case, the holder of this Warrant may exercise the purchase rights with respect
to this Warrant within 20 days from the date of mailing such notice and all
rights herein granted not so exercised within such 20day period shall thereafter
become null and void.

SECTION 5. NOTICE OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS

If the Board of Directors of the Company shall declare any dividend or
other distribution on its Common Stock except out of earned surplus or by way of
a stock dividend payable on its Common Stock, the Company shall mail notice
thereof to the holder of this Warrant not less than 20 days prior to the record
date fixed for determining shareholders entitled to participate in such dividend
or other distribution and the holder of this Warrant shall not participate in
such dividend or other distribution or be entitled to any rights on account or
as a result thereof unless and to the extent that this Warrant is exercised
prior to such record date. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to
distributions made in connection with transactions covered by Section 3. 

SECTION 6. FRACTIONAL SHARES

In the event that any exercise of this Warrant would result in the issuance
by the Company of a fractional share of Common Stock, the Company shall pay to
the holder of this Warrant upon such exercise an amount in cash equal to the
market price, as determined by the Company, of one whole share of the Common
Stock multiplied by such fractional share.

SECTION 7. FULLY PAID STOCK; TAXES.

The Company covenants and agrees that the shares of Common Stock to be
delivered on the exercise of the purchase rights herein provided for shall, at
the time of such delivery, be validly issued and be fully paid and
nonassessable. The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when
due and payable any and all Federal and State transfer, stamp excise or similar
taxes which may be
<PAGE>
payable in respect of this Warrant or any Common Stock upon the exercise of the
purchase rights herein provided for pursuant to the provisions hereof. The
Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in
respect of any transfer involved in the transfer and delivery of Common Stock
(and the certificates evidencing ownership thereof) in any name other than that
of the holder exercising this Warrant, and any such tax shall be paid by such
holder at the time of such transfer.

SECTION 8. CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS.

The right to exercise this Warrant shall not be suspended during any period
that the stock transfer books of the Company for its Common Stock may be closed.
The Company shall not be required, however, to deliver certificates of its
Common Stock upon such exercise while such books are duly closed for any
purpose, but the Company may postpone the delivery of the certificates for such
Common Stock until the opening of such books, and they shall, in such case, be
delivered promptly upon the opening thereof, or as soon as practicable
thereafter.

SECTION 9. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY OF WARRANTS AND SHARES; COMPLIANCE
WITH LAWS.

Section 9.1. In General. This Warrant and the Common Stock issued upon the
exercise hereof shall not be transferable except upon the conditions hereinafter
specified, which conditions are intended to insure compliance with the
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (or any similar Federal statute at the
time in effect) and any applicable State securities laws.

Section 9.2. Restrictive Legends. Each Warrant shall bear on the face
thereof a legend substantially in the form of the notice endorsed on the first
page of this Warrant.

Each certificate for shares of Common Stock initially issued upon the 
exercise of any Warrant and each certificate for shares of Common Stock issued
to a subsequent transferee of such certificate shall, unless otherwise 
permitted by the provisions of this Section 9.2, bear on the face thereof a 
legend reading substantially as follows:

'The shares represented by this certificate have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any
State securities laws and may not be sold or transferred in the
absence of such registration or an exemption therefrom under
said Act and any such State laws which may be applicable and are
transferable only upon the conditions specified in the Warrant
pursuant to which such shares were issued.'

In the event that a registration statement covering the Underlying Shares
or the Restricted Stock shall become effective under the Securities Act and
under any applicable State securities laws or in the event that the Company
shall receive an opinion of its counsel that, in the opinion of such counsel,
such legend is not, or is no longer, necessary or required (including, without
limitation, because of the availability of the exemption afforded by Rule 144(k)
of the Regulations of the Commission), the Company shall, or shall instruct its
transfer agents and registrars to, remove such legend from the certificates
evidencing the Restricted Stock or issue new certificates without such legend in
lieu thereof. Upon the written request of the holder or holders of any Warrant
or of any Restricted Stock the Company covenants and agrees forthwith to request
its counsel to render an opinion with respect to the matters covered by this
Section 9.2 and to bear all expenses in connection with the same.

Section 9.3. Notice of Proposed Transfer; Registration Not Required. The
holder of each Warrant or any Restricted Stock, by acceptance thereof, agrees to
give prior written notice to the Company of such holder's intention to transfer
such Warrant or the Underlying Shares relating thereto or such Restricted Stock
(or any portion thereof), describing briefly the manner and circumstances of the
proposed transfer; provided, however, that no such notice shall be required for
a transfer under a registration, qualification or filing for exemption requested
in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.4 below. Promptly after receiving
such written notice, the Company shall present copies thereof to Company counsel
and to counsel designated by such holder, who may be an employee of such holder.
If in the opinion of each such counsel (which opinions shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) the proposed transfer may be effected without
registration or qualification under any Federal or State law of such Warrant or
the Underlying Shares or such Restricted Stock, the Company, as promptly as
practicable, shall notify such holder of such opinion and of the terms and
conditions, if
<PAGE>
any, to be observed, whereupon such holder shall be entitled to transfer such
Warrant or Underlying Shares or such Restricted Stock, all in accordance with
the terms of the notice delivered to such holder by the Company. If either of
such counsel is unable to render such an opinion (in which case said counsel
shall set forth in writing the basis for his legal conclusions in this regard)
or, if the Company shall not find either of such opinions reasonably acceptable,
(in which case the Company shall set forth in writing the reasons such opinion
is not acceptable), the proposed transfer described in the written notice given
pursuant to this subparagraph may not be effected without such registration or
qualification or without compliance with the conditions of an exemptive
regulation of the Commission or any applicable State securities regulatory
authority, the Company shall promptly notify such holder and thereafter such
holder shall not be entitled to effect such transfer until receipt of a
subsequent notice from the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence or until such registration or qualification, filing or compliance has
become effective. All fees and expenses of counsel (including reasonable fees
and expenses of one counsel for all holders of Warrants or Restricted Stock) in
connection with the rendition of the opinions provided for in this subparagraph
shall be paid by the Company.

Section 9.4. Required Registration and Notice. (a) Upon the written request
of any holder of any Warrant or Restricted Stock setting forth such holder's
intent to transfer such Warrant or the Underlying Shares relating thereto or
such Restricted Stock (or any portion thereof), describing briefly the manner
and circumstances of such transfer and requesting that the Company effect the
registration or qualification or filing for exemption under applicable Federal
or State law of such Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock, the Company shall
promptly give written notice to all holders of Warrants and Restricted Stock of
a proposed registration or qualification or filing for exemption, and shall,
subject to the conditions of Section 9.5, as expeditiously as possible,
endeavor, in good faith, to effect any such registration or qualification or
filing for exemption of:

(i) such Underlying Shares or such Restricted Stock, or both, and

(ii) all Underlying Shares and Restricted Stock of all holders of
Warrants or Restricted Stock which shall have advised the Company in
writing within 20 days after the giving of such written notice by the
Company of their desire to have their Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock
registered or qualified or exempted,

with, or notification to or approval of, any governmental authority under any
Federal or State law, which may be required reasonably to permit the sale or
other disposition of any such Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock which the
holders thereof propose to make promptly upon the effectiveness of such
registration, qualification or filing for exemption. In connection with any
registration pursuant to this Section 9.4, if requested by the holders of the
Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock which is being registered, the Company
shall use its best efforts to list its Common Stock on a National Securities
Exchange selected by the Company.

(b) If the Company is required to effect a registration, qualification or
filing for exemption pursuant to this Section 9.4, the Company will:

(i) prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement with
respect to such Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock and use its best
efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain
effective;

(ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration
statement effective and current and to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the sale or other disposition of all shares
covered by such registration statement, including such amendments and
supplements as may be necessary to reflect the method of disposition from
time to time intended by selling shareholders, but in no event for a period
longer than 6 months in the case of any registration effected through the
use of Form S-1 and 9 months in the case of any registration effected
through the use of Form S-3;

(iii) furnish to selling shareholders such number of copies of a
prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act, and such other
<PAGE>
documents, as selling shareholders may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the public sale or other disposition of such shares;

(iv) use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares covered by
such registration statement under such other securities, Blue Sky or other
applicable laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as selling
shareholders request; and

(v) furnish to selling shareholders a signed counterpart, addressed to
selling shareholders, of (x) an opinion of counsel for the Company, dated
the effective date of the registration statement, and (y) a 'comfort'
letter signed by the independent public accountants who have certified the
Company's financial statements included in the registration statement; in
each case covering substantially the same matters with respect to the
registration statement and the prospectus included therein (and in the case
of the accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent to the date
of the financial statements), as are customarily covered at the time of
such registration in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants'
letters delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings of
securities.

Section 9.5. Conditions to Required Registration. The Company shall not be
required to register, qualify or file or to use its best efforts to effect any
registration, qualification or exemption of the Restricted Stock or Underlying
Shares under the Securities Act or any applicable State securities law or
regulation pursuant to Section 9.4:

(a) on more than two occasions; or

(b) at any time prior to September 30, 1997; or

(c) on more than one occasion in any period of six months; or

(d) unless a request therefor is made to the Company by the holders of
at least 25% of the aggregate number of the Underlying Shares and/or shares
of Restricted Stock; or

(e) at any time, for up to a maximum of three months, if, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company's Board of Directors, the timing of such
registration is not in the best interests of the Company due to the
pendency of an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction,
event or proceeding.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.4 or 9.6, the Company
shall in no event be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction
where it is not so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to
taxation or to service of process in any State where it is not otherwise subject
to such taxation or service of process.

Section 9.6. Incidental Registration. The Company agrees that at any time
it proposes to register any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act (other
than pursuant to Section 9.4) on Form S1 or any other form of registration
statement then available for the registration under the Securities Act of
securities of the Company and which is appropriate for the inclusion therein of
the Underlying Shares and/or the Restricted Stock as herein contemplated, it
will give written notice to all holders of outstanding Warrants and Restricted
Stock of its intention so to do and upon the written request of the holder of
any such Warrants or Restricted Stock who intends to transfer such Warrants or
Restricted Stock promptly upon the effectiveness of such registration, given
within 20 days after receipt of any such notice from the Company, the Company
will in each instance use its best efforts to cause all Underlying Shares
relating to the Warrants held by any such requesting holder of Warrants and all
such Restricted Stock held by any requesting holder to be registered under said
Securities Act and registered or qualified under any State securities law, all
to the extent necessary to permit the sale or other disposition thereof in the
manner stated in such request by the prospective seller of the securities so
registered; provided, however, that the obligation to give such notice and to
use such best efforts shall not apply to any proposal of the Company to register
any of its securities under the Securities Act (i) on Form S8 (or any successor
form), (ii) in connection with dividend reinvestment plans, or (iii) for the
purpose of offering such securities to another business entity or the
shareholders of such entity in connection with the acquisition of assets or
shares of capital stock, respectively, of such entity. Any holder of such
Warrants or Restricted Stock requesting registration of the Underlying Shares
relating to such Warrants or such Restricted Stock shall in its request describe
briefly the manner of any proposed
<PAGE>
transfer of such Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock. Nothing in this Section
9.6 shall be deemed to require the Company to proceed with any registration
after giving the notice herein provided.

Section 9.7. Limitations.

(a) In the case of any registration pursuant to either Section 9.4 or
Section 9.6 in which the Company shall also participate, if the managing
underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of
securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number
which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range
acceptable to the Company, the Company will include in such registration (i)
first, the securities the Company proposes to sell, (ii) second, the Underlying
Shares or Restricted Stock and shares of Common Stock (the 'Parent Shares') held
by MEDIQ Incorporated (the 'Parent') pro rata among the holders of such
Underlying Shares and Restricted Stock and Parent Shares on the basis of the
number of shares requested to be included in such registration by each such
holder, and (iii) third, any other securities requested to be included in such
registration.

(b) If a particular registration is an underwritten registration on behalf
of any holder or holders of the Company's securities (other than Underlying
Shares or Restricted Stock), and the managing underwriters advise the Company in
writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included
in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner
in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders initially
requesting such registration, the Company will include in such registration (i)
first, the securities requested to be included therein by the holders requesting
such registration, the Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock requested to be
included in such registration, and the Parent Shares requested to be included in
such registration, pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of
the number of securities so requested to be included therein, and (ii) second,
any other securities requested to be included in such registration.

(c) The holders of the Warrants and the Restricted Stock agree that in the
case of any offering of securities made by the Company that is registered
pursuant to the Securities Act, upon the request of the Company such holders
will not effect any public sale or distribution of Underlying Shares or
Restricted Stock, including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
Act, during the seven day period immediately prior to and during the 90-day
period beginning on the effective date of such offering (except to the extent
such Underlying Shares or Restricted Stock is sold in connection with such
registration pursuant to the terms of this Warrant); provided that the holders
shall not be obligated to agree to any such restriction unless each such holder
who desired to participate in such registration has been given an opportunity to
do so and shall have been given an opportunity to register at least one half of
the Underlying Shares and Restricted Stock which such holder shall have
initially requested to have registered in such offering.

(d) If a particular registration is an underwritten registration, the
holders of the Warrants and the Restricted Stock to be included in such
registration shall enter into an underwriting agreement with the underwriter or
underwriters selected by the Company.

Section 9.8. Expenses. The Company will pay all expenses (including without
limitation registration fees, qualification fees, legal expenses, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for all of the holders of Warrants
or Restricted Stock whose Underlying Shares relating to such Warrants or whose
Restricted Stock is being registered, printing expenses, the costs of special
audits or 'cold comfort' letters and 'Blue Sky' expenses of underwriters
including reasonable legal expenses relating thereto, NASD filing fees and
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any necessary special experts but
excluding underwriters' discounts and commissions) in connection with the first
registration pursuant to Section 9.4 and related qualifications, notifications
or exemptions by each such holder of the Restricted Stock which is being
registered in such registration pursuant to Section 9.4 and all registrations,
qualifications, notifications or exemptions pursuant to Section 9.6. If less
than all of the Underlying Shares or Restricted Shares which shall have been the
subject of the request for registration pursuant to Section 9.4 shall have been
registered pursuant to such request pursuant to Section 9.7(a), then such
registration shall be deemed an incidental registration pursuant to Section 9.6
and not a demand registration pursuant to Section 9.4. The expense of the second
registration pursuant to Section 9.4 shall be borne pro rata by the holder or
holders making the request. The determination of such pro rata portion shall be
made on the basis of the relative amounts of net proceeds received by
<PAGE>
such holder or holders (as reflected in the prospectus or prospectuses included
in the registration statement filed in connection with such registration) for
all such Underlying Shares and Restricted Stock as are included in such
registration.

Section 9.9. Indemnification. In connection with any registration,
qualification, notification, or exemption of securities under Section 9.4 or
9.6, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify the holder of the Warrants and/or
Restricted Stock, and each underwriter thereof including each person, if any,
who controls such Warrant holder or stockholder within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages and liabilities
caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement of a material fact contained
in any registration statement or prospectus or notification or offering circular
(and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any
amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or caused by
any omission, or alleged omission, to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information
furnished in writing to the Company by such holder or, as the case may be, any
such underwriter expressly for use therein, and the Company and each officer,
director and controlling person of the Company shall be indemnified by each
holder of Warrants and/or Restricted Stock for all such losses, claims, damages
and liabilities caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement or omission,
or alleged omission, based upon information furnished in writing to the Company
by such holder for any such use.

Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this Section 9.9 of
notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party in
respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against any
indemnifying party under this Section 9.9, such indemnified party shall notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action, but the
failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any
liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this
Section 9.9. In case notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to
the indemnifying party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any
other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such
action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable costs of
investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless the indemnifying
party either agrees to pay the same or fails to assume the defense of such
action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. No
indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement entered into without its
consent.

If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.9 from the
indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which such
indemnified party would be otherwise entitled hereunder, then the indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in
connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to
above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. In no
event shall any person be required to contribute an amount greater than the
dollar amount of the proceeds received by such person with respect to the sale
of any Common Stock.
<PAGE>
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 9.9 were determined by pro rata allocation
or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The contribution
provided for in this Section 9.9 shall survive, with respect to a holder of
Common Stock, the transfer of Common Stock by such holder and with respect to a
holder of Common Stock, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

Section 9.10. Miscellaneous. Following the registration of the Common Stock
under the Securities Act, the Company shall comply with all reporting
requirements set forth or referred to in Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act.

The Company shall at its expense provide the holders of the Warrants or 
Restricted Stock with any information necessary in connection with the 
completion and filing of any reports or forms required to be filed by them
under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any Rule
promulgated by the Commission thereunder.

granted under this Warrant shall include only Common Stock of the Company
having a par value of $.01 per share authorized at the date hereof and any
class of Common Stock issued in substitution therefor.

The term 'Unexercised Portion of the Warrant' shall mean the Original
Applicable Percentage of this Warrant minus the aggregate percentage of Pro
Forma Shares received by the holder (or any prior holder) of this Warrant

the mutilated Warrant, or in lieu of the Warrant lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft or
destruction of such Warrant, and upon receipt of indemnity satisfactory to the
Company. If an institutional holder is the owner of any such lost, stolen or
destroyed Warrant, then the affidavit of an authorized officer of such owner,
setting forth the fact of loss, theft or destruction and of its ownership of
such Warrant at the time of such loss, theft or destruction shall be accepted as
satisfactory evidence thereof and no further indemnity shall be required as a
condition to the execution and delivery of a new Warrant other than the written
agreement of such owner to indemnify the Company.

SECTION 13. WARRANT HOLDER NOT SHAREHOLDER.

This Warrant does not confer upon the holder hereof any right to vote or to
consent or to receive notice as a shareholder of the Company, as such, in
respect of any matters whatsoever, or any other rights or liabilities as a

purposes of this Warrant.

decision shall not affect the validity of any remaining portion, which remaining
portion shall remain in force and effect as if this Warrant had been executed
