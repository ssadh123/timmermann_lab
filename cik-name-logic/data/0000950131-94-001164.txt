ATTACHMENT A
------------

CHICAGO, July 8, 1994 -- First Chicago Corporation announced today that it 
has completed the acquisition of Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc., the holding company 
for Lake Shore National Bank and the Bank of Hinsdale.

The acquisition dramatically increases First Chicago's presence in the 
North Michigan Avenue community, an affluent and thriving market. First Chicago 
this weekend will convert the former Lake Shore flagship at 605 N. North 
Michigan Avenue and the branch in the Hancock Center to branches of The First 
National Bank of Chicago.

First Chicago also will covert this weekend a branch in Lincoln Park and 
four in Du Page County -- Hinsdale (two locations), Woodridge and Glen Ellyn -- 
to branches of The First National Bank of Chicago. All are in attractive 
consumer and small business markets.

Most of Lake Shore's middle-market customers will be served by bankers at 
American National, while most retail and trust customers will be served by The 
First National Bank of Chicago.

Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, each outstanding share of 
Lake Shore common stock will be exchanged for 0.617 of a share of First Chicago 
common stock, based on First Chicago's 20-day average closing stock price of 
$50.41.

First Chicago will issue approximately 6.2 million common shares in 
exchange for all outstanding Lake Shore stock. (Assuming all stock options 
previously granted to Lake Shore employees are exercised over time, First 
Chicago will issue a total of approximately 6.4 million shares for the 
acquisition.)

This acquisition will be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.

Lake Shore had assets of approximately $1.2 billion at June 30, 1994. First
Chicago Corporation, with $59.8 billion in assets, is the nation's 12th largest 
bank holding company, providing a complete line of financial products and 
services to corporations, institutions, medium-sized companies, small businesses
and consumers. It has more than 100 locations throughout the Chicago 
metropolitan area.
