July 19, 1994, Houston, Texas ........ Reading & Bates
Corporation (RB-NYSE) reported a net loss of $6.0 million ($.13
per share after preferred stock dividends of $1.2 million), on
revenues of $39.5 million, for the quarter ended June 30, 1994
compared to net income of $2.2 million ($.04 per share), on
revenues of $48.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1993.
The decrease in net income is primarily attributable to lower
average dayrates and lower fleet utilization. Utilization for
the second quarter of 1994 was 68% compared to 88% in the second
quarter of 1993. 

For the six months ended June 30, 1994 the Company reported
a net loss of $7.5 million ($.18 per share after preferred stock
dividends of $2.4 million) compared with net income of $51,000
for the six months ended June 30, 1993. Revenues for the first
half of 1994 were $81.8 million compared to revenues of $84.2
million for the first half of 1993. 

The Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul B.
Loyd, Jr., said that the earnings weakness was chiefly due to
lower jackup and semi-submersible utilization in a number of
countries in which the Company operates. "We believe that
international utilization should improve based on recent
indications that oil companies will release a greater percentage
of funding for exploration and development from their budgets in
the future," Mr. Loyd stated.

Reading & Bates is a New York Stock Exchange listed company,
providing offshore drilling services throughout the world. Its
wholly owned subsidiary, Reading & Bates Development Co. provides
technical, construction and project management services to the
upstream offshore oil and gas industry worldwide.
