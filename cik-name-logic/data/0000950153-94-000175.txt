entitled to priority under Section 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, including,
without limitation, fees payable pursuant to Section 1930 of Title 28 of the
United States Code, but not including the Post-Petition Agreement Claims. To the

appropriately adjusted at an identical compounded rate if the Effective Date
occurs on any other date other than as set forth above, and provided, further,
that if an unexpired letter of credit expires at any time prior to the Effective

minus (D) $1,976,000; plus (E) the principal amount drawn under any unexpired

3.3.4. Class 3.4 -- Hangar Facility Bonds. This Class consists of any
Secured Claims arising from that certain Indenture of Trust dated August 1,
1986, between the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Phoenix,

amended and supplemented from time to time and as in effect as of the Petition
Date and pursuant to which the Variable Rate Airport Facility Revenue Bonds
(America West Airlines, Inc. Project) Series 1986 were issued. The principal
collateral securing these claims consists of the AWA maintenance and technical
support facility located at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. On the
Effective Date, the holders of the Allowed Class 3.4 Claims will receive (i)
promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $29,500,000 due five

<PAGE> 18

years after the Effective Date with aggregate principal payments of $204,861 per
month and bearing interest at the Bank of America Reference Rate plus 1% per
annum and commencing in September 1994, (ii) promissory notes in the aggregate
principal amount of $6,500,000 with aggregate principal payments of $270,833 per
month and bearing interest at the Bank of America Reference Rate plus 1% per
annum and commencing in September 1994, (iii) Allowed General Unsecured Claims
in the aggregate amount of $2,000,000 and (iv) reimbursement of actual and
reasonable expenses associated with the negotiating and documenting the
treatment provided hereby. In the event that NewAWA is successful in remarketing
new or substituted tax-exempt bonds for such facility, it will use the proceeds
first to extinguish the indebtedness evidenced by such notes and, if NewAWA does
not remarket such bonds by the date one year after the Effective Date, there
will be an additional principal payment on the aggregate of $29,500,000 in notes
described above in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 on the first Business Day
of the thirteenth month after the Effective Date. The holders of such Claims
will retain all of the liens securing such Claims to secure the aforementioned
notes as such liens may exist as of the Effective Date. Subject to agreement of
the parties, covenants in the applicable loan documents will be modified to
reflect, among other things, current projections of NewAWA performance. The
holders of such Claims will not assert any right of subordination of the type
contemplated by Section 3.5.3 herein and will dismiss any claims now pending
with regard to any such right. Class 3.4 is impaired under the Plan.

3.3.5. Class 3.5 -- Lockheed Finance No. 2. This Class consists of any
Secured Claims arising from that certain Master Equipment Lease Agreement No.
0134 dated as of November 12, 1987, between AWA and Lockheed Finance
Corporation, as amended and supplemented from time to time and as in effect as
of the Petition Date. The principal collateral securing this Claim consists of
certain ground support equipment. On the Effective Date, the holder of the
Allowed Class 3.5 Claim will receive a promissory note in the amount of $750,000
bearing interest at the 30-day LIBOR rate (as provided for in such Master Lease
Agreement) plus 200 basis points per annum, payable over a term of five years in
level monthly principal installments, plus interest. The holder of such Claim
will have no Unsecured Deficiency Claim and will retain all of the liens
securing such Claim as such liens may exist as of the Effective Date to the
extent of the amount of the Note. Class 3.5 is impaired under the Plan.

3.3.6. Class 3.6 -- Other Secured Claims. This Class consists of
Allowed Secured Claims not specifically provided for above. On the Effective
Date, as to such Allowed Secured Claim, at AWA's option either:

(a) the holder of such Claim shall be treated in accordance with
the terms and conditions of all documents respecting such Claim and the legal,
equitable or contractual rights to which each holder of such Claim is entitled
shall not otherwise be altered;

(b) (i) any default, other than a default of the kind specified
in Section 365(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be cured, provided that any
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, which the Debtor may be obligated to pay
with respect to such default shall be simple interest at the contract rate and
not at any default or penalty rate of interest;

(ii) the maturity of the Claim shall be reinstated as such
maturity existed before any default;

(iii) the holder of the Claim shall be compensated for any
actual damages incurred as a result of any reasonable reliance by the holder on
any contractual provision that entitled the holder to accelerate maturity of the
Claim; and

(iv) the other legal, equitable or contractual rights to
which the holder of the Claim is entitled shall not otherwise be altered;
provided, however, that as to any Allowed Secured Claim which is a nonrecourse
claim and exceeds the value of the collateral securing the Claim, the collateral
may be sold at a sale at which the holder of such Claim has an opportunity to
bid;

12
<PAGE> 19

(c) on the Effective Date, or on such other date thereafter as
may be agreed to by the Debtor and the holder of such Claim, the Debtor shall
abandon the collateral securing such Claim to the holder thereof in full
satisfaction and release of such Claim;

(d) on the Effective Date, the holder of such Claim shall
receive, on account of such Claim, Cash equal to its Allowed Secured Claim, or
such lesser amount to which the holder of such Claim shall agree, in full
satisfaction and release of such Claim;

(e) the holder of such Claim shall retain the liens securing such
Claim and shall receive, on account of such Claim, deferred Cash payments,
pursuant to Section 1129(b)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Bankruptcy Code, totalling at
least the Allowed amount of such Claim, of a Present Value, as of the Effective
Date, of at least the value of such holder's interest in the Debtor's interest
in the property securing such Claim;

(f) on the Effective Date, any property that is subject to the
liens securing such Claim shall be sold, subject to Section 363(k) of the
Bankruptcy Code, free and clear of such liens, with payment of the net proceeds
thereof to the holder of such Claim to the extent of the value of such holder's
respective interest in such property; or

(g) the holder of such Claim shall otherwise realize the
indubitable equivalent of such Claim.

Each holder of an Allowed Claim in Class 3.6 shall be considered to be in its
own separate subclass within Class 3.6, and each such subclass will be deemed to
be a separate Class for purposes of this Plan. In the event that AWA does not
make such designation, the holder of an Allowed Secured Claim shall, at any time
prior to the Effective Date, be entitled to petition the Bankruptcy Court for an
order requiring AWA to make such designation, but shall not be entitled to any
other relief or to exercise any other remedies, except in accordance with such
designation and any applicable Final Order(s) of the Bankruptcy Court.

3.4. Class 4 -- Allowed Convenience Claims. This Class consists of
Convenience Claims. Each Allowed Convenience Claim shall be paid by NewAWA Cash
in the amount of such Allowed Convenience Claim to be distributed as provided in
Section 10.1. Class 4 is not impaired under the Plan.

3.5. Class 5 -- Allowed General Unsecured Claims. This Class consists of
General Unsecured Claims.

3.5.1. Each holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim shall receive
its Pro Rata Share of 26,775,000 shares of NewAWA Class B Common Stock;
provided, however, that if the holder is an Electing Unsecured Creditor in
accordance with Section 3.5.2, such holder shall receive Electing Creditor Cash
equal to $8.889 for each share of NewAWA Class B Common Stock otherwise
allocable to it under this sentence.

3.5.2. A holder of an Allowed General Unsecured Claim may become an
Electing Unsecured Creditor only by providing notice of such election on the
Ballot which such holder submits. Any holder of a Disputed General Unsecured
Claim that wishes to become an Electing Unsecured Creditor must provide notice
to the Debtor of the exercise of such right by no later than the Voting
Deadline. Each such election by a holder of a General Unsecured Claim shall be
irrevocable and must pertain to the entire amount of such holder's General
Unsecured Claim. In the event that the aggregate amount of the Electing Creditor
Cash would be in excess of $100,000,000, then each Electing Unsecured Creditor
shall receive only its Pro Rata Share of $100,000,000 in Cash and shall also
receive a number of shares of Electing Creditor Stock equal to the number of
shares of NewAWA Class B Common Stock it would have received if it were a
Non-Electing Unsecured Creditor minus the result of dividing the Electing
Creditor Cash it receives by $8.889. For purposes of allocating Electing
Creditor Cash among Electing Unsecured Creditors, each Disputed General
Unsecured Claim held by an Electing Unsecured Creditor shall initially be valued
at its face amount; provided, however, in the event that the aggregate amount of
Electing Creditor Cash would exceed $100,000,000 and one or more holders of
Disputed General Unsecured Claims have become Electing Unsecured Creditors, then
any party in interest with regard thereto (including, without limitation, the
Creditors' Committee), may seek an order of the Bankruptcy Court estimating the
amount of any and all such Disputed General Unsecured Claims at a lower amount
and, then, regardless of the amount at which such Disputed General Unsecured
Claims are eventually Allowed, the holders thereof will be paid Electing
Creditor Cash in an amount which does not exceed the amount of Electing Creditor
Cash which would be payable for a Claim in the amount of such

13
<PAGE> 20

estimate and for any amount of the Disputed Claim which is Allowed in excess of
such estimate, the holder shall receive Electing Creditor Stock in accordance
with Section 10.4. NewAWA Class B Common Stock distributed to Non-Electing
Unsecured Creditors, Electing Creditor Stock and Electing Creditor Cash shall be
distributed in accordance with Section 10.2.

3.5.3. Any holder of an Unsecured Claim asserting that payment to any
other holder of an Unsecured Claim should be subordinated to such first holder
under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, may only make such assertion by
filing an adversary proceeding in the Chapter 11 Case on or before the Voting
Deadline, or such other date as may be established by Final Order of the
Bankruptcy Court. Any such subordination of one Unsecured Claim to another
Unsecured Claim shall be made only upon Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court and
no distribution hereby to any holder of an Allowed Claim which is the subject of
such an adversary proceeding shall be delayed or withheld except upon Final
Order of the Bankruptcy Court. Any such adversary proceeding involving holders
of AWA Debenture Claims shall name as defendants the Debtor and on behalf of all
such holders, the Indenture Trustee.

3.5.4. Class 5 is impaired under the Plan.

3.6. Class 6 -- AWA Preferred and Common Stock.

3.6.1. Class 6.1 -- AWA Preferred Stock. This Class consists of AWA
Preferred Stock. Each holder of shares of AWA Preferred Stock shall receive its
Pro Rata Share of $500,000 in Cash plus the right to purchase as of the
Effective Date its Pro Rata Share of the first 250,000 shares of
Over-Subscription Stock at the price of $8.889 per share or such lesser amount
of Over-Subscription Stock as is available after the purchase of Equity
Subscription Stock in accordance with Section 3.6.2. Such Cash shall be
distributed in accordance with Section 10.1. Payment for such Over-Subscription
Stock shall be made no later than the Effective Date. Such Cash and rights shall
be deemed to be in full satisfaction for all Claims and Equity Interests arising
in connection with the AWA Preferred Stock including accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon. Class 6.1 is impaired under the Plan. All shares of AWA
Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be cancelled, annulled and extinguished on
the Effective Date.

3.6.2. Class 6.2 -- AWA Common Stock.

(a) This Class consists of shares of AWA Common Stock other than
shares of AWA Common Stock which are pledged as collateral for Employee Stock
Purchase Notes. Each holder of such AWA Common Stock shall receive its Pro Rata
Share of (i) the Equity Interests Stock and (ii) the Equity Interests Warrants,
to be distributed in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 10.2.

(b) Additionally, each such holder of AWA Common Stock other than
the holder of a Disputed Equity Interest shall have the right to purchase its
Pro Rata Share of the Equity Subscription Stock at the price of $8.889 per
share; provided, however, that for purposes of determining such Pro Rata Share
(i) there shall be considered to be an aggregate of 22,100,000 shares of AWA
Common Stock and (ii) each such holder shall be considered to own the number of
shares of AWA Common Stock for which it is the beneficial owner on the
Disclosure Statement Order Date. Such right is not transferrable and may only be
exercised by the beneficial holder of such AWA Common Stock as of the Voting
Record Date by the irrevocable indication thereof on the Ballot which such
holder delivers or causes to be delivered, but in the event that Persons not
previously holders of AWA Common Stock purchase AWA Common Stock after the
Voting Record Date and own such AWA Common Stock on the Disclosure Statement
Order Date, each such Person shall be given the opportunity to subscribe for its
Pro Rata Share of Equity Subscription Stock and, if available, for
Over-Subscription Stock. Each holder of AWA Common Stock entitled to a Ballot
may also indicate on the Ballot that it wishes to purchase Over-Subscription
Stock, if available. The Over-Subscription Stock available to Purchasing
Stockholders shall consist of the Equity Subscription Stock not subscribed for
in accordance with the second preceding sentence and less the Over-Subscription
Stock sold to holders of AWA Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3.6.1.
Each Purchasing Stockholder must irrevocably indicate on the Ballot the maximum
number of shares of Equity Subscription Stock and Over-Subscription Stock which
it desires to purchase. As set forth more fully in Section 10.2, either full
payment or a satisfactory guarantee of

14
<PAGE> 21

payment for all Equity Subscription Stock and Over-Subscription Stock must be
delivered by the Voting Deadline. The procedure for allocating Over-Subscription
Stock is set forth in Section 10.2.

(c) Class 6.2 is impaired under the Plan. All shares of AWA
Common Stock will be cancelled, annulled and extinguished on the Effective Date.

3.7. Class 7 -- Certain Other Claims and AWA Warrants, Options and Other
Equity Interests.

3.7.1. Class 7.1 -- Employee Stock Purchase Note Claims and Certain
AWA Common Stock. This Class consists of Stock Rescission or Damage Claims
(including, without limitation, Claims by members of the putative plaintiff
class in the Securities Action) which are held by Persons who are obligated
under one or more Employee Stock Purchase Notes. This Class also includes AWA
Common Stock pledged as collateral for Employee Stock Purchase Notes. Each
holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest in this Class shall receive in
exchange for and in consideration of the dismissal with prejudice and permanent
enjoinment of the Securities Actions, a release of any and all indebtedness
incurred under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including the forgiveness,
abandonment and cancellation of any liability under the Employee Stock Purchase
Notes, but shall receive no other distribution under the Plan. In addition, all
liens on AWA Common Stock securing Employee Stock Purchase Notes will be
released and such AWA Common Stock will be returned to AWA and cancelled,
annulled and extinguished as of the Effective Date and will not be entitled to
any distribution under Section 3.6.2. Pursuant to Sections 1123(a)(5)(E), (F)
and 1123(b)(3)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, the treatment provided Class 7.1
Claims constitutes a compromise and settlement of the Securities Action and any
and all objections to such Claims. The Debtor will either file appropriate
pleadings seeking to effect the treatment provided Class 7.1 Claims in this
Section 3.7.1 as a compromise and settlement prior to the Confirmation Hearing
or request the Bankruptcy Court to approve this compromise and settlement at the
Confirmation Hearing as in the best interests of the Debtor and holders of
Claims and Equity Interests and fair, equitable and reasonable. Class 7.1 is
impaired under the Plan.

3.7.2. Certain AWA Warrants, Options and Other Equity Interests and
Other Claims. This Class consists of the following Claims and Equity Interests
(except to the extent they are included in Class 7.1): (i) AWA Warrants,
Options, and Other Equity Interests, (ii) Stock Rescission or Damage Claims,
(iii) Subordinated Claims and (iv) all Claims, if any, arising from the
cancellation or rejection (to the extent they constitute executory contracts) of
AWA Warrants, Options and Other Equity Interests. Holders of such Claims and
Equity Interests will not be entitled to receive or retain any property under
the Plan on account of such Claims or Equity Interests, and pursuant to Section
1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, are deemed not to have accepted the Plan. Class
7.2 is impaired under the Plan. All AWA Warrants, Options and Other Equity
Interests will be cancelled, annulled and extinguished on the Effective Date.

ARTICLE 5

EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

5.1. Assumption of Certain Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.

5.1.1. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in any contract,
instrument, release, indenture or other agreement or document entered into in
connection with the Plan, on the Effective Date, pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, AWA shall assume or assume and assign, as indicated, each of
the Assumed Agreements including, without limitation, the executory contracts
and unexpired leases listed on Schedule 3 hereto; provided, however, that AWA or
NewAWA shall have the right, at any time prior to the Effective Date, to amend
Schedule 3: (a) unless indicated otherwise on Schedule 3, to delete any
executory contract or unexpired lease listed therein, thus providing for its
rejection pursuant to Section 5.2; or (b) to add any executory contract or
unexpired lease, thus providing for its assumption or assumption and assignment
pursuant to this Section 5.1.1. The Debtor or NewAWA shall provide notice of any
amendments to Schedule 3 to the parties to the executory contracts or unexpired
leases affected thereby and, if such amendments are made before the Effective
Date, to the parties on the Official Service List. Pursuant to Section
1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Confirmation Order shall constitute an
order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the assumptions and assignments
described in this Section 5.1.1, pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code,
as of the Effective Date.

5.1.2. Unless otherwise agreed by AWA and the counterparty to any such
Assumed Agreement, (i) all cure payments which may be required by Section
365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code under any Assumed Agreement, if not previously
made, shall be made on the Effective Date or promptly thereafter, and (ii) in
the event of a dispute regarding the amount or timing of any cure payments, the
ability of NewAWA to provide adequate assurance of future performance, or any
other matter pertaining to assumption or assignment, such dispute shall be
resolved by the Bankruptcy Court and NewAWA shall make such cure payments, if
any, or provide such assurance as may be required by the Final Order resolving
such dispute on the terms and conditions of such Final Order.

5.1.3. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan (including any such
provision on Schedule 3) or in any contract, instrument, release or indenture or
other agreement or document entered into in connection with the Plan, each
Assumed Agreement shall, at AWA's option, be assumed only to the extent that any
such contract or lease constitutes an executory contract or unexpired lease.
Listing a contract or lease on Schedule 3 shall not, in and of itself,
constitute an admission by the Debtor or NewAWA that such contract or lease is
an executory contract or unexpired lease or that the Debtor or NewAWA has any
liability thereunder. Contracts and leases which are within the definition of
Assumed Agreements and which are later determined

17
<PAGE> 24

to have not been in fact executory contracts or unexpired leases,
shall be treated in accordance with the provisions in the Plan for the treatment
of that type of Claim which properly arises from the true nature of the legal
relationship between the parties as determined by the Bankruptcy Court or by
settlement; provided, however, that either the Debtor or NewAWA may in its sole
discretion amend the Plan to provide for different treatment of any such Claim
after Notice and a Hearing.

5.1.4. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan (including any such
provision on Schedule 3) or in any contract, instrument, release or indenture or
other agreement or document entered into in connection with the Plan, all
assumptions of executory contracts and unexpired leases under the Plan shall be
without prejudice to the rights of the Debtor or NewAWA to assign later such
assumed executory contracts or unexpired leases, notwithstanding any prohibition
to the contrary in any such contract or lease.

5.2. Rejection of Certain Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases. On the
Effective Date, except for every Assumed Agreement, each executory contract and
unexpired lease entered into by AWA prior to the Petition Date that has not
previously expired or terminated pursuant to its own terms and (to the extent
they are executory contracts) all AWA Warrants, Options and Other Equity
Interests shall be rejected pursuant to Sections 365 and 1123(b)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code and considered a Rejected Agreement hereunder.

5.3. Claims Based on Rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases.
All proofs of claim with respect to Claims arising from the rejection of any
Rejected Agreement shall be filed with the Bankruptcy Court no later than thirty
(30) days after the Effective Date. Any Claims not filed within such time shall
be forever barred from assertion against the Debtor, its estate and property, or
NewAWA.

(ii) its Claim has been temporarily allowed for voting purposes only by order of
the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3018 (in which case such Claim

contingent or unliquidated) and no objection to such Claim has been filed, (iv)
it has filed a proof of claim on or before the Bar Date (or such later date as
the Bankruptcy Court may have established with respect to any particular Claim,
but not later than the date of the order approving such Disclosure Statement),
and such Claim is not a Disputed Claim, or (v) its Equity Interest is registered
on the stock ledger or equivalent of the Debtor. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a holder of a Disputed Claim which has not been temporarily allowed as

18
<PAGE> 25

provided above may nevertheless vote such Disputed Claim in an amount equal to
the portion, if any, of such Claim which is not disputed and is shown as fixed,
liquidated and undisputed in the Debtor's Schedules or such amount which the
Debtor concedes is Allowed in a filing made by the Debtor in the Bankruptcy
Court. Each holder of an AWA Debenture Claim, and not the Indenture Trustee with
respect to such Claim, shall have the right to vote to accept or reject the
Plan.

7.2. Acceptance by Class of Holders of Claims or Equity Interests. A Class
of holders of Claims shall have accepted the Plan if the Plan is accepted by at
least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the Allowed
Claims of such Class that have voted to accept or reject the Plan. A Class of
Equity Interests shall have accepted the Plan if acceptance is voted for by the
holders of at least two-thirds in amount of the Equity Interests of such Class
who have voted to accept or reject the Plan.

7.3. Cramdown. Inasmuch as Class 7.2 is deemed not to have accepted the
Plan in accordance with Section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and in the event
that one or more other Classes of impaired Claims or Equity Interests does not
accept or is deemed not to have accepted the Plan, the Debtor requests that the
Bankruptcy Court confirm the Plan in accordance with Section 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code. AWA and AmWest reserve the right to modify the Plan to the
extent, if any, that confirmation pursuant to Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code requires or permits such modification.

8.7. Indemnification Obligations.

8.7.1. Upon, and at all times after the Effective Date, the NewAWA
Charter shall contain provisions which (i) eliminate the personal liability of

obligations of the Debtor to indemnify its current and former directors,
officers, employees, and any officer, director or employee serving as a

by-laws, contract or applicable state law shall be deemed to be, and may be
treated as though they are, executory contracts that are Assumed Agreements
under the Plan, and such obligations (subject to any defenses thereto) shall
survive confirmation of the Plan and remain unaffected thereby, irrespective of

change its business, without any supervision by the Bankruptcy Court or the
Office of the United States Trustee, and free of any restrictions imposed on the
Debtor by the Bankruptcy Code or by the Bankruptcy Court during the Chapter 11
Case. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to prohibit, limit,
restrict or condition the Debtor's authority in any lawful manner to sell or
otherwise dispose of any other assets.

directed to take all necessary steps, and perform all necessary acts, to
consummate the terms and conditions of the Plan, including, without limitation,

ARTICLE 10

PROVISIONS COVERING DISTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS

10.1. Making of Distributions and Payments. NewAWA, or a Distribution Agent
on its behalf, shall make the payments and distributions expressly required to
be made by it in respect of the Post-Petition Agreement Claims, Allowed
Administrative Claims (other than Preserved Ordinary Course Administrative

21
<PAGE> 28

Claims), Allowed Priority Wage Claims, Allowed Priority Benefit Plan
Contribution Claims, Allowed Priority Tax Claims, Allowed Convenience Claims and
AWA Preferred Stock upon the latest of (i) the Effective Date, or as soon
thereafter as practicable, (ii) such date as may be fixed by the Bankruptcy
Court, or as soon thereafter as practicable, (iii) the fifth Business Day after
such Claim is Allowed, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and (iv) such date
as the holder of such Claim and NewAWA have agreed or shall agree.

10.2. Distributions by the Distribution Agent.

10.2.1. On the Effective Date, NewAWA will issue in the name of the
Distribution Agent, as trustee, the Non-Electing Creditor Stock for distribution
to Non-Electing Unsecured Creditors in accordance with Section 3.5, and the
Electing Creditor Stock for distribution to Electing Unsecured Creditors in
accordance with Section 3.5. Additionally, NewAWA will deliver to the
Distribution Agent the Electing Creditor Cash for distribution to Electing
Unsecured Creditors in accordance with Section 3.5. As promptly as practicable
after the issuance of such NewAWA Securities and delivery of Electing Creditor
Cash to the Distribution Agent, the Distribution Agent will distribute such
securities and Cash to the holders of Allowed Claims entitled thereto in
accordance with Section 3.5, but shall reserve from such distributions the
Reserve Amount as required by Section 10.4.

10.2.2. Not later than thirty (30) days after the Voting Deadline, the
Debtor shall allocate among the Purchasing Stockholders, the Equity Subscription
Stock and the Over-Subscription Stock in accordance with this Section 10.2.2 and
advise the Distribution Agent of such allocation. Each Purchasing Stockholder
shall be allocated initially the lesser of (i) the number of shares for which it
has made a valid purchase election on its Ballot and (ii) its Pro Rata Share of
the Equity Subscription Stock determined as provided in Section 3.6.2(b).
Holders who hold shares of AWA Common Stock for the account of others such as
brokers, trustees or depositories may only exercise the right to purchase Equity
Subscription Stock and Over-Subscription Stock upon receipt of instructions and
appropriate payment or guarantee of payment from the beneficial owners of such
shares as of the Voting Record Date. The shares of Equity Subscription Stock not
allocated as above will be considered Over-Subscription Stock and will be
allocated to other holders of AWA Common Stock who have indicated on the Ballot
that they wish to acquire more than their Pro Rata Share of the Equity
Subscription Stock. If sufficient shares of Over-Subscription Stock are
available, all subscriptions therefor will be honored in full. If sufficient
shares of Over-Subscription Stock are not available to honor all such
subscriptions, the available shares of Over-Subscription Stock will be allocated
among those who subscribed based on their proportional number of shares of AWA
Common Stock, as of the Disclosure Statement Order Date. The allocation process
may involve a series of allocations in order to assure that the total number of
shares of Over-Subscription Stock is distributed on a Pro Rata Share basis. The
right to purchase Equity Subscription Stock and Over-Subscription Stock may be
exercised through a holder's broker, who may charge such holder a servicing fee
in connection with such exercise. No such fees shall be paid by the Debtor or
NewAWA. The Debtor shall establish the Stock Payment Escrow Account for the
purpose of receiving payment for Equity Subscription Stock and Over-Subscription
Stock, which shall be held by the Escrow Agent or another bank, trust company or
other organization independent of AWA and designated by the Debtor and approved
by the Bankruptcy Court. Purchasing Stockholders may choose one of the following
methods of payment:

(a) The Purchasing Stockholder may deliver full payment for the Equity
Subscription Stock and the Over-Subscription Stock, together with its
Ballot, with the check made payable to AWA Subscription Stock Escrow
Account, by no later than the Voting Deadline. The Debtor shall deposit all
such checks in the Stock Payment Escrow Account with any interest thereon
to accrue to the benefit of Debtor or NewAWA pending distribution of the
Equity Subscription Stock and Over-Subscription Stock; or

(b) The Purchasing Stockholder may deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Escrow Agent, by no later than the Voting Deadline, a notice of
guaranteed delivery by telegram or otherwise, from a bank or trust company
or a New York Stock Exchange member firm, guaranteeing delivery of payment
of the full price of the subscribed for Equity Subscription Stock and
Over-Subscription Stock. In such case, full payment for the Equity
Subscription Stock and the Over-Subscription Stock (as such amount may be

22
<PAGE> 29

reduced as set forth below) must be received by the Escrow Agent by no
later than 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Confirmation Date.

Promptly after completing the allocation required by the first sentence of this
Section 10.2.2, a confirmation will be sent to each Purchasing Stockholder
showing the number of shares of Equity Subscription Stock and the number of
shares, if any, of Over-Subscription Stock allocated to such holder. In the
event that such number of shares of Over-Subscription Stock is less than the
number of shares of Over-Subscription Stock for which such holder has either
paid for or guaranteed payment for, such notice shall also state such fact and
if full payment shall have already been made for such stock, such notice shall
also include a check representing the excess payment. Whichever of the two above
methods of payment is used, issuance and delivery of the Equity Subscription
Stock, the Over-Subscription Stock and any refunds of payments therefor shall be
subject to collection of checks and actual payment pursuant to any notice of
guaranteed delivery. All offers to purchase Equity Subscription Stock and
Over-Subscription Stock shall be irrevocable. In the event that the Effective
Date has not occurred by the date the Interim Procedures Agreement is
terminated, all amounts in the Stock Payment Escrow Account (other than interest
accrued thereon) shall be returned to the Purchasing Stockholders who have made
payment for the Equity Subscription Stock and/or Over-Subscription Stock.

10.2.3. On the Effective Date, NewAWA will issue in the name of the
Distribution Agent, as trustee, (i) the number of shares of Equity Subscription
Stock and Over-Subscription Stock to be issued to Purchasing Stockholders and
holders of AWA Preferred Stock in accordance with Sections 3.6.1, 3.6.2 and
10.2.2, and (ii) the Equity Interests Stock and the Equity Interests Warrants
for distribution to holders of AWA Common Stock as provided in Section 3.6.2. As
promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, but in any event within
fifteen (15) Business Days, the Distribution Agent will distribute (i) to each
holder of AWA Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Over-Subscription Stock
purchased in accordance with Section 3.6.1, (ii) to each Purchasing Stockholder,
the number of shares of Equity Subscription Stock and Over-Subscription Stock
purchased by such Purchasing Stockholder pursuant to Section 3.6.2 and (iii) to
each holder of AWA Common Stock as of the Distribution Record Date other than
the holder of a Disputed Equity Interest, such holder's Pro Rata Share of the
Equity Interests Stock and of the Equity Interests Warrants, less any Reserve
Amount required pursuant to Section 10.4; provided, however, that holders of AWA
Common Stock whose stock is held of record by Cede or by any other depository or
nominee on their behalf or their broker-dealer's behalf will have their NewAWA
Securities credited to the account of Cede or such other depository or nominee.

10.2.4. The Distribution Agent in its capacity as trustee holding
issued but undistributed NewAWA Securities and Electing Creditor Cash shall (i)
similarly hold in trust for distribution pursuant to this Section 10.2 any
dividend or distribution made thereon, and (ii) whenever any matter (including
election of directors) is presented for a vote by holders of such NewAWA
Securities, vote all of the NewAWA Securities so held by it in trust in the same
manner and proportion as the shares of NewAWA Class B Common Stock are voted.

10.2.5. If, after the Effective Date, NewAWA (i) pays a dividend or
makes a distribution on the outstanding NewAWA Securities held by the
Distribution Agent, (ii) subdivides the outstanding shares of NewAWA Securities
held by the Distribution Agent into a greater number of shares or units, (iii)
combines the outstanding shares or units of NewAWA Securities held by the
Distribution Agent into a smaller number of shares or units, (iv) issues by
reclassification of the outstanding NewAWA Securities held by the Distribution
Agent any shares of its capital stock, or (v) is a party to a consolidation,
merger or transfer of assets providing for any change in or exchange of the
outstanding NewAWA Securities held by the Distribution Agent, then the
Distribution Agent's obligation to distribute NewAWA Securities to any holder of
an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest arising after the record date in the case of
a dividend or distribution and after the Effective Date of any of the other
foregoing transactions shall be adjusted so as to take into account such
dividend, distribution or other event. Any such distribution shall be made net
of any Distribution Agent Charges incurred in connection with such event.

10.2.6. The duties of the Distribution Agent (including its duties as
trustee pursuant to this Section 10.2) are expressly limited to the ministerial
functions set forth in this Article 10. The Distribution

23
<PAGE> 30

Agent shall incur no liability for its actions (or failure to act) or conduct as
Distribution Agent, or as trustee holding issued but undistributed NewAWA
Securities or Cash except to the extent attributable to the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Distribution Agent. The Distribution Agent shall at
all times maintain a segregated account for any Cash being held in trust, and
shall deposit or invest all such Cash in (a) direct obligations of the United
States of America or obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged, (b) certificates of deposit and interest
bearing deposits with banks having a long-term bond rating of AA or better and
capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $100,000,000, (c)
commercial paper having one of the two highest ratings by Standard & Poor's,
Inc. or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., except as otherwise authorized by the
Bankruptcy Court, or (d) reasonable shares of money market funds which invest in
short-term United States government obligations; provided, however, that no such
deposit or investment shall have a maturity of more than 90 days. All
Distribution Agent Charges shall be deducted from the applicable NewAWA
Securities or Cash held by the Distribution Agent. All Cash and NewAWA
Securities held by or transferred to the Distribution Agent for distribution to
holders of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests pursuant to the Plan shall be held
by the Distribution Agent (including NewAWA in its capacity as Distribution
Agent) solely as trustee of an express trust and shall not be or constitute
property of the Distribution Agent (including NewAWA as Distribution Agent) for
any purpose whatsoever, and the Distribution Agent shall not have any right or
interest to any such Cash or stock for its own account, except as expressly
provided in the Plan.

10.2.7. AWA shall deliver to the Distribution Agent its stock ledger
for the AWA Common Stock or provide access thereto, which ledger shall reflect
the cancellation of certain AWA Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.7.1.
The Distribution Agent shall cause a register for the transfer of Allowed Claims
(other than Allowed AWA Debenture Claims) and of AWA Common Stock to be
maintained. Transfers after the Distribution Record Date shall be registered
only (i) upon Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court directing such transfer or
(ii) in the event of a transfer by operation of law.

10.3. Service of Indenture Trustee.

10.3.1. Subject to the right of the Indenture Trustee to resign and
terminate an Indenture as set forth in Section 10.3.2, the Indenture Trustee
shall receive and act as disbursing agent for all distributions to each holder
of record of an Allowed AWA Debenture Claim. Unless terminated pursuant to
Section 10.3.2 below, the Indentures shall continue in effect after the
Effective Date for the sole purpose of allowing the Indenture Trustee to make
the distributions to be made on account of such Allowed AWA Debenture Claims
under the Plan and for defending any subordination action brought under Section
3.5. AWA and NewAWA shall be required to reimburse the Indenture Trustee solely
for fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable costs of counsel associated
therewith) in connection with activities required under this Section 10.3.1. Any
fees, costs, or expenses incurred by the Indenture Trustee for any other
activities it may undertake shall be collectible solely from the holders of AWA
Debentures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indenture
Trustee shall retain any and all charging liens or similar rights provided in
the Indentures for so long as it is Indenture Trustee.

10.3.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture Trustee may at
any time terminate any or all of the AWA Indentures and all of the Indenture
Trustee's duties and obligations and authority to act thereunder, with or
without cause, by giving fifteen (15) days written notice of termination to
NewAWA and the Distribution Agent and by turning over to the Distribution Agent
a list of record holders of Debentures under such Indenture as of the
Distribution Record Date, together with such other information and documents as
may be reasonably necessary in order to permit the Distribution Agent to make
distributions to holders of Allowed AWA Debenture Claims arising out of the AWA
Debentures issued pursuant to such Indenture. If distributions under the Plan
have not been completed at the time of termination of such Indenture, the
Distribution Agent shall thereafter act in place of such Indenture Trustee, and
all references in the Plan to the Indenture Trustee for purposes of making
distributions under the Plan with regard to such Indenture shall be deemed to
apply to such Distribution Agent. Any actions taken by the Indenture Trustee not
for a purpose authorized in the Plan shall be of no force or effect.

24
<PAGE> 31

10.3.3. For purposes of any distributions under the Plan to holders of
AWA Debenture Claims, the Indenture Trustee (or if the Indenture Trustee has
resigned in accordance with Section 10.3.2, the Distribution Agent as its
successor) shall be deemed to be the sole holder of all AWA Debenture Claims
evidenced by the AWA Debentures issued under each Indenture. Accordingly, all
distributions provided for in the Plan on account of Allowed AWA Debenture
Claims shall be distributed to the Indenture Trustee as disbursing agent or, if
the Indenture Trustee has resigned pursuant to Section 10.3.2, to the
Distribution Agent as its successor, for further distribution to individual
holders of Allowed AWA Debenture Claims pursuant to the Plan. The transfer books
of the Indenture Trustee for the Debentures shall close as of the Distribution
Record Date and no further transfers shall be recognized.

10.3.4. Any provision of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no
distribution under the Plan shall be required to be made by the Indenture
Trustee or the Distribution Agent to any holder of an AWA Debenture Claim until
such time as the certificate representing the AWA Debenture in respect of which
such AWA Debenture Claim is made shall have been surrendered in accordance with
Section 10.3.5. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10.3.4 to the
contrary, any holder of an AWA Debenture Claim based on a certificate
representing an AWA Debenture that has been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
may, in lieu of surrendering such certificate as provided in this Section 10.3,
deliver to the Indenture Trustee, or if the Indenture Trustee has resigned, to
the Distribution Agent as its successor, (i) evidence satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee or the Distribution Agent, as the case may be, of the loss,
theft, mutilation or destruction of such certificate and (ii) such security or
indemnity as may reasonably be required by the Indenture Trustee or the
Distribution Agent, as the case may be, to save the Indenture Trustee or the
Distribution Agent, as the case may be, harmless with respect thereto, and upon
providing such evidence and such security or indemnity the holder of such AWA
Debenture Claim shall, for all purposes under the Plan, be deemed to have
surrendered such certificate.

10.3.5. A holder of record on the Distribution Record Date of a
certificate relating to an AWA Debenture Claim shall surrender such holder's
certificate representing such AWA Debenture Claim to the Indenture Trustee, or
if the Indenture Trustee has resigned in accordance with Section 10.3.2, to the
Distribution Agent as its successor, in accordance with written instructions
given not more than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date to such holder by
the Indenture Trustee or the Distribution Agent, as the case may be. Upon
receipt of any certificate relating to such AWA Debenture Claim, the Indenture
Trustee or the Distribution Agent shall cancel such certificate and deliver such
canceled certificate to such Person as the Distribution Agent shall designate.

10.3.6. On the Final Distribution Date, all rights under the Plan of
any holder of an Allowed AWA Debenture Claim which has not surrendered its
certificate representing such AWA Debenture Claim in accordance with this
Section 10.3 shall lapse and be automatically terminated without any further
action and the Indenture Trustee or the Distribution Agent as its successor
shall at such time return to the Distribution Agent any funds or property it
then holds in respect of such unsurrendered certificate to be treated as
unclaimed property pursuant to Section 10.6 and, upon such return, the Indenture
Trustee or the Distribution Agent as its successor shall have no further
obligation in respect of such funds or property.

10.4. Reserves for Distributions for Disputed Claims and Disputed Equity
Interests.

10.4.1. Except as may be otherwise agreed with respect to any Disputed
Claim or Disputed Equity Interest and as approved by the Bankruptcy Court, no
distributions shall be made with respect to all or any portion of a Disputed
Claim or Disputed Equity Interest unless and until such Disputed Claim or
Disputed Equity Interest (or portion thereof) shall have become an Allowed Claim
or Equity Interest and such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest is otherwise
entitled to distributions hereunder.

10.4.2. Prior to making any distribution to holders of Allowed Claims
or Equity Interests in Class 5 or Class 6.2 in accordance with Section 10.2, the
Distribution Agent shall deposit in a Reserve established separately for each
such Class an amount of NewAWA Securities and/or Cash equal to the amount of
such distribution that would have been distributed to holders of Disputed Claims
or Disputed Equity Interests in such Class if such Disputed Claims or Equity
Interests were Allowed Claims or Equity Interests in their full face amount at
the time of the calculation of such distribution. A separate Reserve shall be
established and

25
<PAGE> 32

thereafter maintained for each Class as to which any Claims or Equity Interests
remain Disputed as of the Effective Date. The Distribution Agent shall at all
times until any Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest is resolved by Final
Order, retain in the Reserve all amounts that would have been distributed to the
holder of such Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest had such Claim or
Equity Interest been an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest in its full face amount
on the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon motion by the Debtor
or NewAWA, the Bankruptcy Court may enter a Reserve Order, establishing a
Reserve Amount to be escrowed in the Reserve for any Class which may be less
than the amount otherwise required hereunder, which amount shall reflect the
Bankruptcy Court's estimate of the level of Reserves for a particular Class
reasonably required to protect the legitimate rights and interests of holders of
Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests in such Class. In the event a
Reserve Order is entered, the Distribution Agent shall deposit or retain in the
Reserve with respect to any Class subject to such order only the Reserve Amount
required by such Reserve Order. Any amount not so deposited or retained shall be
distributed to all holders of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests in the Class
for which such Reserve Amount was established as provided for in the Plan. The
date of each such distribution shall be a Distribution Date.

10.4.3. As soon as practicable after a Disputed Claim or Disputed
Equity Interest, or portion thereof, becomes an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest, the Distribution Agent shall make a distribution to the holder of such
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest from the Reserve in the amount of (i) the
portion of the NewAWA Securities or Cash in the Reserve that should be
distributed pursuant to the terms of the Plan in view of the amount of the
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest; plus (ii) the proportional share of any
interest, earnings or dividends actually earned and received on such Reserve;
less (iii) the proportional share of any Distribution Agent Charges incurred on
account of such escrowed assets. To the extent that sufficient New AWA
Securities or Cash are not available to make the full distribution required by
the preceding sentence, in view of the then-appearing rights of the holders of
other Disputed Claims and Disputed Equity Interests, the Distribution Agent
shall make such lesser distribution as shall then be ordered by the Bankruptcy
Court. No holder of a Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest shall have any
claim against the Reserve for the Class in which such Disputed Claim or Disputed
Equity Interest is included until such Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity
Interest shall become an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest. In no event shall any
holder of any Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest have any recourse
against or be entitled to receive (under the Plan or otherwise) or recover from
the Debtor, NewAWA, the Distribution Agent or any Reserve, any payment (in Cash,
NewAWA Securities or other property) in the event that the Reserve therefor is
insufficient to pay an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest in full. In no event
shall the Distribution Agent, the Debtor or NewAWA have any responsibility or
liability for any loss to or of any Reserve.

10.4.4. The Reserve for a Class shall be terminated when all Disputed
Claims and Disputed Equity Interests are finally resolved in such Class. All
remaining assets, if any, in the Reserve shall be distributed, first, to
holders, if any, who received less than a proportionate distribution pursuant to
order of the Bankruptcy Court under Section 10.4.3 and thereafter to all holders
of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests in the Class for which such Reserve was
established, on a pro rata basis. The date of such distribution shall be the
Final Distribution Date with regard to such Class.

10.5. Fractional Interests; Odd Lots; De Minimis Distributions.

10.5.1. Fractional shares or units of NewAWA Securities shall not be
issued or distributed and no Cash payments shall be made in respect thereof. All
holders of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests in such Class which would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest in such NewAWA Security shall be
placed on a list in descending order according to the size of the fractional
interest in the NewAWA Security to be distributed. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, Electing Unsecured Creditors and Non-Electing Unsecured Creditors
shall be placed on separate lists. In the event that two or more holders of
Allowed Claims or Equity Interests are entitled to the same fractional portion
(rounded to six decimal places) in such NewAWA Security, their relative ranking
on any such list shall be determined by lot. The fractional shares or units
which each such holder would have received will be aggregated. Then, one share
or unit, as applicable, will be distributed to each of the holders on such list
in descending order until the total amount of aggregated shares or units is
exhausted.

26
<PAGE> 33

10.5.2. In the event that any holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest would receive fewer than ten (10) shares or units of NewAWA Securities
in a distribution made under this Article 10, the Distribution Agent may instead
sell such NewAWA Securities on behalf of any or all of such holders and they
distribute to each such holder its pro rata share of the Net Proceeds of such
sale. Such sale may be either a private sale or through a securities exchange or
automated quotation system on which such NewAWA Securities are listed and absent
manifest error or intentional wrongdoing on the part of the Distribution Agent
in connection with such sale, the Net Proceeds realized from such sale shall be
conclusively determined to be reasonable. The distribution of a pro rata share
of such Net Proceeds to each such holder shall be deemed to be in full
satisfaction of the payment to be made to such holder of Allowed Claims or
Equity Interests in such distribution. These procedures are intended to result
in the affected holders receiving appropriate distributions while saving
expenses in the administration of the Debtor's estate that would be associated
with maintaining such holders as stockholders of NewAWA.

10.6. Delivery of Distributions; Unclaimed Property. Distributions and
deliveries to holders of (i) Allowed General Unsecured Claims shall be made at
the addresses set forth on the proofs of claim filed by such holders (or at the
last known addresses of such holders if no proof of claim is filed or if NewAWA
has been notified of a change of address), (ii) AWA Debenture Claims shall be
made at the address contained in the records of the Indenture Trustee (or, if
the Indenture Trustee has resigned pursuant to Section 10.3.2 of the Plan, in
such records it has delivered to the Distribution Agent as its successor) and
(iii) Equity Interests shall be made to the address shown on the stock ledger of
AWA. If any holder's distribution is returned as undeliverable, no further
distributions to such holder shall be made unless and until the Distribution
Agent, NewAWA or the Indenture Trustee is notified in writing of such holder's
then-current address, at which time all missed distributions shall be made to
such holder without interest (except to the extent that such missed
distributions have become unclaimed property). Amounts in respect of
undeliverable distributions made through the Distribution Agent or through the
Indenture Trustee, shall be returned to NewAWA until such distributions are
claimed. All claims for undeliverable distributions shall be made on or before
the second (2nd) anniversary of the applicable Distribution Date, and after such
date, such undeliverable distributions shall be unclaimed property. All
unclaimed property attributable to any Claim or Equity Interest shall revert to
the Reserve, if any, then existing with regard to Claims or Equity Interests of
such Class and, if none exists, to NewAWA, and the Claim of any holder with
respect to such property shall be discharged and forever barred and shall no
longer be deemed an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest.

10.7. Method of Payment. Payments of Cash required to be made pursuant to
the Plan shall be made by check drawn on a domestic bank or by wire transfer
from a domestic bank at the election of the Person making such payment.

10.8. Payment Dates. Whenever any payment or distribution to be made under
the Plan shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment or
distribution shall instead be made, without interest, on the immediately
following Business Day.

10.9. Compliance with Tax Requirements. In connection with the Plan, to the
extent applicable, the Distribution Agent and the Indenture Trustee shall comply
with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any
governmental unit, and all distributions pursuant to the Plan shall be subject
to such withholding and reporting requirements. The Distribution Agent and
Indenture Trustee shall be authorized to take any and all actions that may be
necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting
requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, (i) each Person
(including holders of Allowed Claims and Equity Interests) receiving a
distribution of Cash or NewAWA Securities pursuant to the Plan shall have sole
and exclusive responsibility for the satisfaction and payment of any tax
obligations imposed by any governmental unit, including income, withholding and
other tax obligations, on account of such distribution and (ii) at the option of
NewAWA, no distribution pursuant to the Plan shall be made to or on behalf of
such entity unless and until such entity has made arrangements satisfactory to
NewAWA for the satisfaction and payment of such tax obligations. At the option
of NewAWA, any Cash or NewAWA Securities to be distributed pursuant to the Plan
shall, pending the implementation of such arrangements, be treated as an
undeliverable distribution pursuant to Section 10.6 above.

PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED
CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS

11.1. Filing of Objections to Claims or Equity Interests. After the
Effective Date, objections to Claims or Equity Interests shall be made and
objections to Claims or Equity Interests made previous thereto shall be pursued
only by NewAWA and, upon leave of the Bankruptcy Court for good cause shown, the
Creditors' Committee (if it is then still in existence). Any objections made by
NewAWA or the Creditors' Committee after the Effective Date shall be served and
filed not later than 180 days after the Effective Date; provided, however, that
such period may be extended by order of the Bankruptcy Court for good cause
shown.

11.2. Settlement of Objections to Claims or Equity Interests After
Effective Date. From and after the Effective Date, NewAWA may litigate to
judgment, propose settlements of, or withdraw objections to, all pending or
filed Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests, and NewAWA may settle or
compromise any Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest, without notice and a
hearing and without approval of the Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, notice
of any settlement or compromise involving the allowance of a General Unsecured
Claim in excess of $100,000 shall be provided to the Indenture Trustee (if the
AWA Indentures have not been previously terminated) and to the Creditors'
Committee (if still then in existence), who shall each have ten (10) days to
object to such settlement or compromise and in such case, such settlement or
compromise must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

11.3. Payment or Distribution to Holders of Disputed Claims or Equity
Interests. Except as the Debtor or NewAWA, as applicable, may otherwise agree
with respect to any Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest, no payments or
distributions shall be made with respect to any portion of a Disputed Claim or
Disputed Equity Interest unless and until all objections to such Disputed Claim
or Disputed Equity Interest have been settled or determined by a Final Order of
the Bankruptcy Court. Payments and distributions to each holder of a Disputed
Claim or Disputed Equity Interest to the extent that it ultimately becomes an
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest shall be made in accordance with Section 10.4.
A Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest that is estimated for purposes of
allowance and distribution pursuant to Section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and
which is estimated and Allowed at a fixed amount by Final Order of the
Bankruptcy Court shall thereupon be an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest for all
purposes in the amount so estimated and Allowed.

11.4. Reserves for Disputed Claims and Disputed Equity Interests.
Appropriate Reserves for Disputed Claims and Disputed Equity Interests shall be
established and maintained as provided in Section 10.4.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

12.1. Modification of Payment Terms. NewAWA reserves the right to modify
the treatment of any Allowed Claim in any manner adverse only to the holder of
such Claim at any time after the Effective Date upon the consent of the holder
whose Allowed Claim treatment is being adversely affected.

12.2. Discharge of Debtor. The rights afforded and the treatment of Claims
and Equity Interests under the Plan shall be in exchange for and in complete
satisfaction, discharge, release and termination of all Claims of any nature
whatsoever against the Debtor or any of its assets or properties and all Equity
Interests in the Debtor; and upon the Effective Date (i) the Debtor shall be
deemed discharged and released pursuant to Section 1141(d)(1)(A) of the
Bankruptcy Code from any and all Claims, including but not limited to demands
and liabilities that arose before the Effective Date, all debts of the kind
specified in Section 502(g), 502(h) or 502(i) of the Bankruptcy Code, whether or
not (a) a proof of claim based upon such debt is filed or deemed filed under
Section 501 of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) a Claim based upon such debt is allowed
under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or (c) the holder of a Claim based upon
such debt has accepted the Plan; and (ii) all rights and interests of holders of
Equity Interests in the Debtor shall be terminated pursuant to Section
1141(d)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Confirmation Order shall be a judicial
determination of

28
<PAGE> 35

discharge and termination of all liabilities of and all Claims against, and all
Equity Interests in, the Debtor, except as otherwise specifically provided in
the Plan. On the Effective Date, as to every discharged debt, Claim and Equity
Interest, the holder of such debt, Claim or Equity Interest shall be permanently
enjoined and precluded from asserting against NewAWA or against its assets or
properties or any transferee thereof, any other or further Claim or Equity
Interest based upon any document, instrument or act, omission, transaction or
other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Effective Date,
except as expressly set forth in the Plan or the Confirmation Order.

12.3. Termination of Subordination Rights. Except as specifically provided
elsewhere herein, on the Confirmation Date, all contractual, legal or equitable
subordination rights that a holder of a Claim or Equity Interest may have with
respect to any distribution to be made pursuant to the Plan shall be discharged
and terminated, and all actions related to the enforcement of such subordination
rights shall be permanently enjoined. Accordingly, distributions pursuant to the
Plan to holders of Allowed Claims and Equity Interests shall not be subject to
payment to a beneficiary of such terminated subordination rights, or to levy,
garnishment, attachment or other legal process by any beneficiary of such
terminated subordination rights. Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019 and in
consideration for the distribution and other benefits provided under the Plan,
the provisions of this Section 12.3 shall constitute a good faith compromise and
settlement of all claims or controversies relating to the termination of all
contractual, legal and equitable subordination rights that a holder of a Claim
or Equity Interest may have with respect to any Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest, or any distribution to be made on account of such Allowed Claim or
Allowed Equity Interest.

12.4. Termination of the Creditors' and Equity Committees.

12.4.1. The Creditors' Committee shall, unless theretofore terminated,
terminate on the Effective Date and shall thereafter have no further
responsibilities in respect of the Chapter 11 Case except (i) with respect to
preparation and filing of applications for compensation and reimbursement of
expenses in accordance with Section 2.2.3, (ii) with respect to any contested
matter or adversary proceeding commenced prior to the Effective Date in which
the Creditors' Committee is an indispensable litigant or any appeal of an order
in the Chapter 11 Case in which the Creditors' Committee is an indispensable
litigant and if, in each case, the Creditors' Committee's participation in such
proceeding is consistent with the orders of the Bankruptcy Court establishing
the Creditors' Committee and with Section 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii)
with respect to monitoring and participating in matters and proceedings which
could give rise to General Unsecured Claims (including, without limitation,
Avoidance Litigation, rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases and
resolution of Unsecured Deficiency Claims and Disputed General Unsecured Claims)
for a period of five months after the Effective Date, unless such period is
extended by the Bankruptcy Court for good cause shown. In connection with such
activities, the Creditors' Committee may continue the retention of its counsel,
its local counsel and its accountants and may replace one or more of such
professional advisors, if necessary, but shall not retain additional
professional advisors. NewAWA shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Creditors' Committee incurred in connection with such activities, provided,
however, that the aggregate fees related to matters and proceedings which could
give rise to General Unsecured Claims shall not exceed an average of $75,000 per
month for the first two months after the Effective Date and an average of
$50,000 per month for any subsequent month. All such fees and expenses shall be
paid only in accordance with the fee and expense guidelines promulgated by the
Debtor in the Bankruptcy Case and shall be paid by NewAWA within thirty (30)
days of receipt of invoice therefor, except in the case of an objection to any
such fees and expenses, which, if not resolved by NewAWA and the Creditors'
Committee, may be noticed by either such entity for a hearing before the
Bankruptcy Court. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
12.4.1, all such activities shall cease when the aggregate amount of Disputed
Claims is less than $3,000,000 or one year after the Effective Date, whichever
occurs first, except in a case where the Creditors' Committee is an
indispensable litigant as contemplated by clause (ii) above.

12.4.2. The Equity Committee shall, unless theretofore terminated,
terminate on the Effective Date and shall thereafter have no further
responsibilities in respect of the Chapter 11 Case except (i) with respect to
preparation and filing of a final application for compensation and reimbursement
of expenses in accordance with Section 2.2.3 and (ii) with respect to any
contested matter or adversary proceeding commenced prior to the Effective Date
in which the Equity Committee is an indispensable litigant or any appeal of an
order in the

29
<PAGE> 36

Chapter 11 Case in which the Equity Committee is an indispensable litigant and,
in each case, if the Equity Committee's participation in such proceeding is
consistent with the orders of the Bankruptcy Court establishing the Equity
Committee and with Section 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code.

12.5. Setoffs. The Debtor and NewAWA may, but shall not be required to, set
off or recoup against any Claim and the payments or other distributions to be
made pursuant to the Plan in respect of such Claim, claims of any nature
whatsoever which the Debtor or NewAWA may have against the holder of such Claim
to the extent such Claim may be set off or recouped under applicable law, but
neither the failure to do so nor the allowance of any Claim hereunder shall
constitute a waiver or release by the Debtor or NewAWA, of any such claim that
it may have against such holder.

12.6. Opt-Out. Pursuant to Section 203(b)(3) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, AWA elects, as of the Effective Date, that it will no longer be
governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

12.7. Section Headings. The Section headings contained in the Plan are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of the Plan.

12.8. Severability. If any provision of the Plan is found by the Bankruptcy
Court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then, at the option of the Debtor
or NewAWA, such provision shall not affect the validity or legality of any other
provisions of the Plan which shall remain effective.

12.9. Computation of Time. In computing any period of time prescribed or
allowed by the Plan, the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) shall apply.

12.10. Governing Law. Except to the extent that the Bankruptcy Code, the
Bankruptcy Rules or any other statutes, rules or regulations of the United
States are applicable, and subject to the provisions of any contract,
instrument, release, indenture or other agreement or document entered into in
connection with the Plan, the rights and obligations arising under the Plan
shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Arizona, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
law thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the laws of
escheat and abandoned property of no state shall be applicable to any property
distributed or abandoned hereunder.

ARTICLE 13

SUPERVISION OF THE PLAN

on or before the Outside Date, Investor nevertheless shall be required to
consummate the Investment and, to that end, agrees to timely make such
adjustment to the composition of its partnership and to the Alliance Agreements
as required to resolve such antitrust objection; provided, however, that nothing

or obligate the Company to enter into or approve any adjustment or modification
of the Alliance Agreements which, in the Company's reasonable judgment, is
prejudicial to the Company or the Unsecured Parties in any material respect and
which, if

A-12
<PAGE> 54

entered into or approved, would materially impair the Company's ability to
realize the reasonably anticipated benefits of such Alliance Agreements.

SECTION 11. Registration Rights Agreement. Investor and the Company will
enter into a registration rights agreement on terms acceptable to Investor and
the Company. The registration rights agreement will reflect the understanding of
the parties with respect to their registration rights and obligations and will
provide that Investor, its partners and any assignees and transferees, shall
have the right to cause the Company to (i) include the Securities issuable to
Investor pursuant to the Plan (including any such Securities issued or issuable

connection with any combination of shares, merger, consolidation or similar
transaction), on customary terms, in "piggyback" underwritings and registrations
and (ii) to effect, on customary terms, one demand registration under the
Securities Act for the public offering and sale of the Securities issued to
Investor under the Plan at any time after the third anniversary of the Effective
Date.

SECTION 12. Applicable Provisions of Law and Regulations. It is
understood and agreed that this Agreement shall not create any obligation of, or
restriction upon, the Company or Investor or the partners of Investor that would
violate applicable provisions of law or regulation relating to ownership or
control of a U.S. air carrier. At all times after the Effective Date, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall provide that, in the event
persons who are not U.S. citizens shall own (beneficially or of record) or have
voting control over shares of Common Stock, the voting rights of such persons
shall be subject to automatic suspension as required to ensure that the Company
is in compliance with applicable provisions of law or regulation relating to
ownership or control of a U.S. air carrier.

SECTION 13. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company
represents and warrants to Investor as follows:

(a) The Company has complied in all material respects with the terms
of all orders of the Bankruptcy Court in respect of the Investment, this
Agreement and the Procedures Agreement.

(b) The Company has delivered to Investor copies of the audited
balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 1992 and the statements of
income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended,
together with the notes thereto. Such financial statements, and when
delivered to Investor the financial statements of the Company referred to
in Section 8(g) will, present fairly, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (applied on a consistent basis except as disclosed in
the footnotes thereto), the financial position and results of operations of
the Company as of the dates and for the periods therein set forth.

(c) When delivered to Investor, the unaudited financial statements of
the Company referred to in Section 15(b)(ii) will (i) present fairly, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (applied on a
consistent basis except as disclosed therein and subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments), the financial position and results of operations of the
Company as of the date and for the period therein set forth, it being
understood and agreed, however, that the foregoing representation relating
to conformity with generally accepted accounting principles is being made
only to the extent such principles are applicable to interim unaudited
reports and (ii) reflect a financial position and results of operations not
materially worse than those set forth in the pro forma financial statements
contained in Plan 9.

(d) The Projections and the Monthly Targets were prepared in good
faith on a reasonable basis, and when prepared represented the Company's
best judgment as to the matters set forth therein, taking into account all
relevant facts and circumstances known to the Company. Nothing has come to
the Company's attention since the dates on which the Projections and the
Monthly Targets, respectively, were prepared which causes the Company to
believe that any of the projections and other information contained therein
were misleading or inaccurate in any material respect as of such dates. It
is specifically understood and agreed that the delivery of the Projections
and the Monthly Targets shall not be regarded as a representation, warranty
or guarantee that the particular results reflected therein will in fact be
achieved or are likely to be achieved.

and Investor's acquisition of Securities hereunder for purposes of, and in

the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and, as a consequence,
Investor will not be subject to the provisions of such Section with respect
to any "business combination" between Investor and the Company (as such
term is defined in said Section 203).

SECTION 14. Representations and Warranties of Investor. Investor
represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

(a) The general and limited partners of Investor (other than one such

transactions contemplated by the Alliance Agreements, when viewed together
with all other written statements and information provided to the Company
and its representatives by or on behalf of Investor, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, (i) contains or will contain any
materially misleading statement or (ii) omits or will omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

periods then ended.

SECTION 16. Certain Taxes. The Company shall bear and pay all transfer,
stamp or other similar taxes (if any are not exempted under Section 1146 of the
Bankruptcy Code) imposed in connection with the issuance and sale of the
Securities.

SECTION 17. Administrative Expense. All amounts owed to Investor or its
assignees by the Company under this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the
Procedures Agreement and all orders of the Bankruptcy Court in respect thereof
shall be treated as an allowed administrative expense priority claim under
Section 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.

SECTION 18. Incorporation by Reference. The provisions set forth in the

SECTION 20. Governing Law. Except to the extent inconsistent with the

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, without reference
to principles of conflicts or choice of law under which the law of any other
jurisdiction would apply.

SECTION 21. Amendment. This Agreement may only be amended, waived,

of Common Stock made by Investor (i) to any Affiliate of Investor, (ii) to any

proceeding, (iv) pursuant to judicial order, legal process, execution or

Act.

SECTION 27. Stock Legend. All securities issued to Investor pursuant to
the Plan shall be conspicuously endorsed with an appropriate legend to the
effect that such securities may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed
of except in compliance with (i) Section 26 and (ii) applicable securities laws.

resulting from breaches of their fiduciary duties to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law and (ii) require the Company, subject to appropriate
procedures, to indemnify the Company's former, present and future directors and
executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In
addition, upon consummation of the Plan, the Company shall enter into written
agreements with each person who is a director or executive officer of the

and providing that no recourse or liability whatsoever with respect to this
Agreement, the Procedures Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Plan or the

particular Section or other subdivision and (ii) reference to any Section means
such Section hereof. The Section headings herein are for convenience only and
shall not affect the construction hereof. No provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted or construed against either party solely because such party or
its legal representative drafted such provision.

the termination of the Procedures Agreement.

SECTION 32. Entire Agreement. The Agreement supersedes any and all other
agreements (oral or written) between the parties in respect to the subject

Independent Directors; except that if the Creditors' Committee or the

GPA Director. Unless the rights of GPA hereunder have been terminated

controlled by it, and to cause the AmWest Directors, and the Stockholder
Representatives agree to recommend to the Independent Directors, to vote or
provide written consents in

B-3
<PAGE> 65

favor of such designee and to take any other action necessary to elect such
designee; provided that the GPA Director shall be reasonably acceptable to
AmWest at the time of his or her initial designation.

(d) Except as otherwise provided herein, each of AmWest, the
Stockholder Representatives, and GPA agrees to nominate or cause the
nomination of the AmWest Directors, the Independent Directors, and the GPA
Director, respectively, in accordance with the Bylaws.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall be obligated
to vote any shares for which the voting rights have been suspended, whether
voluntarily or involuntarily.

(f) In the event that AmWest, the Creditors' Committee or Equity
Committee (for so long as each is in existence and has the ability to
designate a director as herein provided), the Stockholder Representatives,
or GPA shall fail or refuse to designate a nominee to the Board for a
position allocated to and to be filled by such group or entity as herein
provided, such position shall not be filled and shall remain vacant unless
and until such designation shall be made as herein provided.

(g) In the event that the rights and obligations of GPA with respect
to this Agreement are terminated in accordance with Section 6.2, GPA agrees

Director, at which time the Board shall be reduced to fourteen (14)
persons.

(h) The parties hereto agree to (i) vote the Common Stock held and
controlled by them in favor of the removal from the Board, upon notice by
the group or entity having the right to designate such director under this
Section 2.1 and requesting such removal, of any person or persons
designated to the Board by such group or entity, and (ii) to vote the
Common Stock held and controlled by them (other than stock held
individually by any Stockholder Representative) and to cause (or in the
case of the Stockholder Representatives, recommend to) the directors
designated by them to vote or take such action as may be required under the
General Corporation Law or otherwise to implement the provisions of this
Agreement. The group or entity who has nominated any director in accordance

director for cause.

Each other party hereto covered by such filing covenants and agrees to promptly
provide to AmWest all information pertaining to such party and necessary to make
such amendments and to notify AmWest of any changes in facts or circumstances
pertaining to such party that would require any amendments under Regulation
13D-G.

4.5 AmWest agrees that it shall not cause any amendment to the provisions

5. RIGHTS UPON BREACH.

5.1 Each party hereto recognizes and agrees that a violation of any term,
provision, or condition of this Agreement may cause irreparable damage to the
other parties which is difficult or impossible to quantify or ascertain and that
the award of any sum of damages may not be adequate relief to such other
parties. Each party hereto therefore agrees that in the event of any breach of
this Agreement, the other party or parties shall, in addition to any remedies at
law which may be available, have the right to obtain appropriate equitable
(including, but not limited to, injunctive) relief. All remedies hereunder shall
be cumulative and not exclusive.

5.2 In addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, each
party hereto agrees that the Company shall have the right (a) to withhold
transfer, and to instruct any transfer agent for securities of the Company to
withhold transfer, of any certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock held by
AmWest or any partner or Affiliate of AmWest or transferee if the Company
reasonably believes that such transfer would not be in material compliance with
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, unless the transferee provides to
the Company an opinion of legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company
that such transfer will be in material compliance with the terms and provisions
hereof, and (b) to require any person requesting such transfer to provide such
information as may reasonably be requested by the Company regarding ownership of
securities, affiliations, if any, between AmWest and the transferee and such
other matters pertaining to the transfer as may be appropriate to enable the
Company to determine the compliance of the proposed transfer of securities with
the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1 This Agreement shall automatically terminate without any action by any
party on the day immediately preceding the Third Annual Meeting and shall not be
extended except in accordance with Section 7.3. Upon such termination, the
rights and obligations of each party hereunder shall terminate and the
provisions of this Agreement shall be of no force and effect; provided that no
such termination shall relieve any person or entity from liability for breach or
default of this Agreement prior to such termination.

6.2 GPA's rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than its
obligations under Section 2.1(g)) shall terminate immediately and without notice
upon the earlier of (a) termination of this Agreement under Section 6.1, (b) the

holding by GPA of less than two percent (2%) of the voting equity securities of
the Company (on a fully diluted basis), or (c) any occurrence, other than as
described in clause (b) above, resulting in the holding by GPA of less than two
percent (2%) of the voting equity securities of the Company (on a fully diluted
basis) if (i) the Company files a Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, or other
written report or statement, that is delivered to GPA and a copy to the party
designated in Section 7.1, reflecting information as to the Company's total
issued and capital stock from which GPA can determine whether it holds less than
two percent (2%) of the voting equity securities of the Company (on a fully
diluted basis) and (ii) GPA continues to hold less than two percent (2%) of the

used aircraft of types consistent with the
Company's fleet plan and requirements (such right
being referred to herein as the "New Put Right").

Each lease entered into by the Company in

of a fair market rental for the related aircraft,
taking into consideration whether the related
aircraft is new or used, the specifications and
condition of the related aircraft and all
provisions of such lease that are relevant to the
overall cost to the Company of the related
aircraft, and determined at or about the time of
delivery of such aircraft to the Company on the
basis of operating lease rentals then prevailing in
the marketplace for comparable operating leases of
comparable aircraft to airlines of comparable
creditworthiness to the Company (at or about the
time of delivery of such aircraft to the Company
and without regard to the prior pendency of the
Case); each such lease will be for a lease term
determined as hereinafter described; and each such
lease shall have such other terms and provisions

to GPA for purposes of the New Put Agreement (in

a particular year, the Company and GPA shall not
have mutually agreed upon the specific number,
types and delivery dates for the aircraft which GPA
will be entitled to deliver to the Company (and

aircraft will be new or used aircraft), GPA will
have the right to put to the Company (and the
Company will be obligated to lease from GPA without
any necessity for further agreement of the Company)
up to the Maximum Number (as such term is
hereinafter defined) of aircraft for such year,
with (i) the specific types of such aircraft being
selected by GPA from among the Eligible Types (as
such term is hereinafter defined), (ii) such
aircraft being new or used aircraft as selected by
GPA, and (iii) the specific delivery dates for such
aircraft being selected by GPA, in each case, upon
at least 150 days' prior written notice by GPA to
the Company; and provided further, however, that,
unless GPA and the Company shall otherwise agree in
writing (whether by reason of mutual agreement
relevant to a particular year or otherwise), GPA
will not have the right to put to the Company more
than five used aircraft during the New Put Period.
As used herein, the term "Mutual Agreement
Deadline" means (i) with respect to each of 1995

to each ensuing year during the New Put Period,
January 1st of the preceding year. As used herein,
the term "Maximum Number" means (i) with respect to
1995, two, and (ii) with respect to each ensuing
year during the New Put Period, three. As used

otherwise agree in writing, the term "Eligible

which GPA will be entitled to put to the Company
without the necessity for further agreement of the
Company, Boeing 737-300 aircraft, Boeing 757
aircraft and Airbus A320 aircraft.

The aircraft which GPA will be entitled to deliver
or put to the Company (and which the Company will
be obligated to lease from GPA) may be new or used
aircraft; provided, however, that unless GPA and
the Company shall otherwise agree in writing, GPA
will not have the right to deliver or put to the
Company more than five used aircraft during the New
Put Period; and provided further, however, that any
such aircraft which is an Airbus A320 aircraft will
(i) be new ex factory or like-new having no greater
than 100 flight hours of commercial service, (ii)
have IAE V2500A-5 engines if (a) the Company has or

fleet on the delivery date for such aircraft,

C-3
<PAGE> 77

(b) the Company is scheduled to have IAE V2500A-5
engines in its fleet within 24 months of the
delivery date for such aircraft, or (c) if new A320

or are not scheduled to be generally available from
the airframe and engine manufacturers on the
delivery date for such aircraft, or have IAE
V2500A-1 Engines (upgraded to maximum performance)
if any of the conditions described in the preceding
clauses (a), (b) and (c) is not fulfilled, and
(iii) have such other specifications (including
configuration) as are substantially the same as
those of other A320 aircraft in the Company's fleet
or as are otherwise mutually agreed upon by GPA and
the Company and, in either case, incorporated in
the New Put Agreement; and provided further,
however, that any such aircraft which is not an
A320 aircraft will have such specifications
(including configuration and engines) as are
substantially the same as those of other aircraft
of the same type in the Company's fleet or as are
otherwise mutually agreed upon by GPA and the
Company and, in either case, incorporated in the
New Put Agreement; and provided further, however,
that any such aircraft which is a used aircraft
will (i) be fresh from (or have no more than 150
flight hours beyond) "C" or annual check, (ii) if
maintained under a program involving block "D"
check, be in at least half-time condition or if

scheduled major check on airframe and engines, and
(iii) be in such other condition (consistent with
operating lease return conditions currently
prevailing in the operating lease marketplace) as
is mutually agreed upon by GPA and the Company and
incorporated in the New Put Agreement.

The lease term shall be (i) not more than eighteen
years and not less than (a) ten years for any new
A320 aircraft, or (b) seven years for any other new

Common and surrendering the certificate or certificates representing such
shares. The Corporation shall promptly issue and deliver the certificate or
certificates evidencing the shares of Class B Common issuable upon conversion
in accordance with the holder's instructions. Such conversion, to the extent
permitted by law, shall be deemed to occur as of the close of business on the
date on which the holder's notice of intent is received and the holder's shares
of Class A Common are surrendered. Class B Common issued under this Article

or a merger of the Corporation with another corporation, or in the case of any
sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Corporation, each holder of a share of Class A Common at the time
outstanding shall be entitled to convert such share into the kind and amount of
shares of stock and other securities and properties (including cash) receivable
upon such reorganization, reclassification, change of shares, consolidation,
merger, sale, lease or other disposition, by a holder of the number of shares
of Class B Common into which such shares of Class A Common might have been
converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, change of
shares, consolidation, merger, sale, lease or other disposition. In the event
of such a reorganization, reclassification, change of shares, consolidation,
merger, sale, lease or other disposition, effective provision shall be made in
the charter of the resulting or surviving corporation or otherwise for the
protection of the conversion rights of the shares of Class A Common as nearly
equivalent as practicable, into any such other shares of stock and other
securities and property deliverable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common
into which such Class A Common might have been converted immediately prior to
such event.

for the purpose of issuance upon conversion of outstanding shares of Class A
Common, such number of shares of Class B Common as shall from time to time be
issuable upon the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Class A
Common. If any shares of Class B Common required to be reserved for purposes
of conversion hereunder (i) require registration with or approval of any
governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares of
Class B Common may be issued upon conversion or (ii) are listed on any national
or regional securities exchange or listing service, the Corporation shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts and incur commercially reasonable costs to
cause such shares to be duly registered, approved, or listed, as the case may
be prior to the effective time of such conversion.

4.1.4.4 The Corporation shall pay all documentary stamp or
other transactional taxes attributable to the issuance or delivery of shares of
Class B Common upon conversion of any shares of Class A Common; provided,
however, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any taxes which may
be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of
any certificate for shares of Class B Common in a name other than of the
registered holder of shares of Class A Common converted.

person is or persons are elected by Directors, in good faith believe themselves
to be a majority of the remaining

faith believe exists, then the acts of such person or persons who are so

interests of the Corporation; provided however, that no indemnification shall
be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the
extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall
deem proper.

proceeding, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a
quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, (iii) by [the stockholders, or (iv) in any case in which

date of its authentication, of the same principal amount, Stated Maturity date
and interest rate as, and bearing interest from the later of (i) the Closing
Date or (ii) the most recent date to which interest has been paid on, the
mutilated or defaced Security, or the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen,
and bearing a number or other distinguishing symbol not appearing on any
Security contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the
mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of or in substitution for the
Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a
substitute Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any
agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be
required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and,
in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof
and in the case of mutilation or defacement, shall surrender the Security to
the Trustee or such agent.

Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Company may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the
fees and expenses of the Trustee or its agent) connected therewith. In case
any Security that has matured or is about to mature or has been called for
redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or
stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or
authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case
of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall
furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the
Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of
them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant
shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft
of such Security and of the ownership thereof.

Every substitute Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.6 by virtue of the fact that any such Security is destroyed, lost or
stolen shall constitute an

16
<PAGE> 25
additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the destroyed,
lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be
entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of
rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and
all other Securities duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the
extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to
the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen
Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies
notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the
contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments
or other securities without their surrender.

SECTION 2.7 Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof.

(a) All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, 
registration of transfer or exchange, if surrendered to the Company or any 
agent of the Company or any agent of the Trustee, shall be delivered to the 
Trustee for cancellation and, upon receipt thereof by the Trustee, shall be
cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as
expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee
shall destroy cancelled Securities held by it and deliver a certificate of
destruction to the Company. If the Company or any agent of the Company shall
acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a
redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities
unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

(b) At such time as all beneficial interests in a Global 
Security have either been exchanged for Securities in non- global form,
redeemed, repurchased or cancelled, such Global Security shall be returned to
and cancelled by the Trustee. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any
beneficial interest in a Global Security is exchanged for Securities in
non-global form, redeemed, repurchased or cancelled, the principal amount of
Securities represented by such Global Security shall be reduced and an
endorsement shall be made on such Global Security by the Trustee to reflect
such reduction.

SECTION 2.8 Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are 
ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate
temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form 
of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers 
appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company 
shall prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written order signed by two 
Officers of the Company, shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange 
for temporary Securities. Until such exchange, temporary Securities shall be 
entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges as definitive Securities.

SECTION 2.9 Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of
Securities. Payment of the principal of and premium (if any) and interest on,
any Security will be made in U.S. Legal Tender.

17
<PAGE> 26
SECTION 2.10 CUSIP Number. A "CUSIP" number will be printed on the 
Securities, and the Trustee shall use the CUSIP number in notices of
redemption, purchase or exchange as a convenience to Holders, provided that
any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness 
or accuracy of the CUSIP number printed in the notice or on the Securities and
that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on
the Securities. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in
the CUSIP number.

ARTICLE THREE - REDEMPTIONS

SECTION 3.1 Notices to Trustee. If the Company elects to redeem 
Securities pursuant to Section 3.7 or is required to redeem Securities
pursuant to Section 3.8 it shall furnish to the Trustee, at least 10 but not
more than 15 days before notice of any redemption is to be mailed to Holders
(or such shorter time as may be satisfactory to the Trustee), an Officers
Certificate stating that the Company has elected to redeem Securities pursuant
to Section 3.7 or is required to redeem Securities pursuant to Section 3.8, as
the case may be, the date notice of redemption is to be mailed to Holders, the
Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed,
the Redemption Price for such Securities and the amount of accrued and unpaid
interest on such Securities as of the Redemption Date. If the Trustee is not
the registrar for the Securities, the Company shall, concurrently with delivery
of its notice to the Trustee of a redemption, cause the registrar for the
Securities to deliver to the Trustee a certificate (upon which the Trustee may
rely) setting forth the name of, and the aggregate principal amount of
Securities held by each Holder. The Company will also provide the Trustee with
any additional information that the Trustee reasonably requests in connection
with any redemption.

SECTION 3.2 Selection of Securities to be Redeemed. If less than 
all outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Company shall select the 
outstanding Securities to be redeemed or accepted for payment in compliance
with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on
which the Securities are listed or, if the Securities are not listed on a
securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by any other method that
the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. If the Company elects to mail notice
of a redemption to Holders, the Trustee shall, at least 5 days prior to the
date notice of redemption is to be mailed, (i) select the Securities to be
redeemed from Securities Outstanding not previously called for redemption, and
(ii) promptly notify the Company of the names of each Holder of Securities
selected for redemption, the principal amount of Securities held by each such
Holder and the principal amount of such Holder's Securities that are to be
redeemed. The Trustee shall select for redemption Securities or portions of
Securities in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples of $1,000;
except that if all of the Securities of a Holder are selected for redemption,
the aggregate principal amount of the Securities held by such Holder, even if
not a multiple of $1,000, may be redeemed. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for
redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.

18
<PAGE> 27
SECTION 3.3 Notice of Redemption.

(a) At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before
any Redemption Date, the Company shall mail by first class mail to each such
Holder's registered address a notice of redemption to each Holder of Securities
or portions thereof that are to be redeemed. With respect to any redemption of
Securities, the notice shall identify the Securities or portions thereof to be
redeemed and shall state: (1) the Redemption Date; (2) the Redemption Price
for the Securities and the amount of unpaid and accrued interest on such
Securities as of the date of redemption; (3) if any Security is being redeemed
in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Security to be redeemed
and that, after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, a new
Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will
be delivered; (4) the name and address of the Paying Agent; (5) that Securities
called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the
Redemption Price for, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, such Securities;
(6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment,
interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the
Redemption Date and the only remaining right of the Holders of such Securities
is to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of the Securities redeemed; and (7) if fewer than all the Securities are
to be redeemed, the identification of the particular Securities (or portions
thereof) to be redeemed, as well as the aggregate principal amount of
Securities to be redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to
be outstanding after such partial redemption.

(b) At the Company's request, the Trustee shall (at the 
Company's expense) give the notice of any redemption to Holders; provided,
however, that the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, at least 10 days prior
to the date that notice of the redemption is to be mailed to Holders, an
Officers' Certificate that (i) requests the Trustee to give notice of the
redemption to Holders, (ii) sets forth the information to be provided to
Holders in the notice of redemption, as set forth in the preceding paragraph,
and (iii) sets forth the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be
redeemed and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest thereon as of the
redemption date. If the Trustee is not the registrar for the Securities, the
Company shall, concurrently with any such request, cause the registrar for the
Securities to deliver to the Trustee a certificate (upon which the Trustee may
rely) setting forth the name of, the address of, and the aggregate principal
amount of Securities held by, each Holder; provided further that any such
Officers' Certificate may be delivered to the Trustee on a date later than
permitted under this Section 3.3(b) if such later date is acceptable to the
Trustee.

SECTION 3.4 Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of
redemption is mailed to the Holders, Securities called for redemption shall
become due and payable on the Redemption Date at the Redemption Price. Upon
surrender to the Trustee or the Paying Agent, the Securities called for
redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price.

19
<PAGE> 28
SECTION 3.5 Deposit of Redemption Price.

(a) On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall 
deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, 
and accrued interest on, all Securities to be redeemed on that date. After any 
Redemption Date, the Trustee or the Paying Agent shall promptly return to the 
Company any money that the Company deposited with the Trustee or the Paying 
Agent in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the Redemption Price of, and 
accrued interest on, all Securities to be redeemed.

(b) If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph, 
unless the Company defaults in the payment of such Redemption Price, interest 
on the Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Securities on 
the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not such Securities are presented 
for payment. If a Security is redeemed on or after an interest record date 
but on or prior to the related Interest Payment Date, then any accrued and 
unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security was 
registered at the close of business on such record date. If any Security 
called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption 
because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, 
interest will be paid on the unpaid principal and interest from the redemption 
date until such principal and interest is paid, at the rate of interest 
provided in the Securities and Section 4.1.

SECTION 3.6 Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a
Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder at the Company's expense a new
Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security
surrendered. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Security so
issued shall be a new Global Security.

20
<PAGE> 29
SECTION 3.7 Optional Redemption. The Company, at its option on 
notice to the Holders as provided herein, may redeem the Securities:

(i) at any time in whole but not in part, at a
Redemption Price equal to 105% of the aggregate principal amount of

(ii) from time to time in part, excluding amounts
redeemed under Section 3.8 hereof, from the Net Offering Proceeds
received by the Company prior to September 1, 1997 from one or more
Public Offering Sales at a Redemption Price equal to 105% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Securities so redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date; and

(b) on and after September 1, 1997, at any time in whole or 
from time to time in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the applicable

September 1, 1997, the Company consummates a Public Offering Sale and
immediately prior to such consummation the Company has cash and Cash
Equivalents, not subject to any restriction on disposition (other than any such
restriction imposed by this Indenture), of at least $100,000,000, then the
Company shall redeem Securities at a Redemption Price equal to 104% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Securities so redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. The aggregate Redemption Price and
accrued and unpaid interest of the Securities to be so redeemed shall equal the
lesser of (a) 50% of the Net Offering Proceeds of such Public Offering Sale and
(b) the excess, if any, of (i) $20,000,000 over (ii) the amount of any Net
Offering Proceeds of any prior Public

21
<PAGE> 30
Offering Sale received prior to September 1, 1997 and applied to redeem
Securities pursuant to this Section 3.8.

ARTICLE FOUR - COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

SECTION 4.1 Payment of Principal and Interest. The Company
covenants and agrees that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid
the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on, each of the Securities at
the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such
Securities and in this Indenture. To the extent lawful, the Company shall pay
interest on overdue principal, premium and interest at a rate equal to the then
applicable interest rate on the Securities, compounded semi-annually.

SECTION 4.2 Offices for Payments, etc. So long as any Securities 
are authorized for issuance pursuant to this Indenture or are outstanding 
hereunder, the Company will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of 
New York, an office or agency where the Securities may be presented for payment 
and for exchange and registration of transfer as in this Indenture
provided. Presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served
at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as specified in Section 12.4
hereof. Presentations and surrenders may also be made at the aforementioned
office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, the address
of which, from time to time, may be obtained by contacting the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other
offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for
any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations;
provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner
relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the
Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, for such purposes. The Company
will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or
rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or
agency.

SECTION 4.3 Appointment to Fill a Vacancy in Office of Trustee. The 
Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of 
Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 8.9, a Trustee so that
there shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to the Securities.

SECTION 4.4 Paying Agents. Whenever the Company shall appoint a 
Paying Agent other than the Trustee with respect to the Securities, it will
cause such Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in
which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of
this Section 4.4,

(a) that it will hold all sums received by it as such agent 
for the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on the
Securities (whether such sums have

22
<PAGE> 31
been paid to it by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities) in trust
for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities or of the Trustee,

(b) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure
by the Company (or by any other obligor on the Securities) to make any payment
of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on the Securities when the
same shall be due and payable, and

(c) that it will pay any such sums so held in trust by
it to the Trustee upon the Trustee's written request, at any time during the
continuance of the failure referred to in clause (b) above.

The Company will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of,
premium (if any) or interest on the Securities, deposit with the Paying Agent a
sum sufficient to pay such principal, premium or interest so becoming due, and
(unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the
Trustee of any failure to take such action.

If the Company shall act as its own Paying Agent with respect to the
Securities it will, on or before each due date of the principal of, premium (if
any) or interest on the Securities set aside, segregate and hold in trust for
the benefit of the Holders of the Securities a sum sufficient to pay such
amount so becoming due. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any
failure to take such action.

Anything in this Section 4.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, but
subject to Section 11.1, the Company may at any time, for the purpose of
obtaining a satisfaction and discharge with respect to the Securities or for
any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust
with respect to the Securities by the Company or any Paying Agent hereunder, as
required by this Section, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts
herein contained.

Anything in this Section 4.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section 4.4 is subject to
the provisions of Sections 11.3 and 11.4 hereof.

SECTION 4.5 Reports and Information.

(a) The Company will furnish to the Trustee within 120
days after the end of each fiscal year an Officers' Certificate stating that
(i) a review of the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the
preceding fiscal year has been made to determine whether the Company has kept,
observed, performed and fulfilled all of its obligations under this Indenture
and the Securities, (ii) such review was supervised by the Officers of the
Company signing such certificate, and (iii) that to the best knowledge of each
Officer signing such certificate, (A) during such year the Company has kept,
observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant contained in this
Indenture and is not in default in the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (or, if a Default or Event
of Default occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of

23
<PAGE> 32
Default of which each such Officer may have knowledge and what action the
Company has taken or proposes to take with respect thereto), and (B) no event
has occurred and remains in existence by reason of which payments on account of
the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on, the Securities are
prohibited or if such event has occurred, a description of the event and what
action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The
Company will, so long as any of the Securities are outstanding, deliver to the
Trustee, promptly after any Officer of the Company becomes aware of (i) any
Default or Event of Default, or (ii) any default or event of default under any
issue of Indebtedness that could result in an Event of Default under Section
7.1, an Officers' Certificate specifying such Default, Event of Default or
default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.

Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall file with the

documents or other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing
as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe) required to be filed
pursuant to such provisions of the Exchange Act. The Company shall file with
the Trustee, within 5 days after it files the same with the Commission, copies
of the quarterly and annual reports and such other information, documents, and
reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission
may by rules and regulations prescribe) that it files with the Commission as
contemplated by this Section 4.5(b). The Company shall also comply with the
other provisions of Section 314(a) of the TIA. If the Company is not required
to file the aforementioned reports, the Company (at its own expense) shall file
with the Trustee and mail, or cause the Trustee to mail, to Holders at their
addresses appearing in the register of Securities at the time of such mailing
within 5 days after it would have been required to file such information with
the Commission, all information and financial statements, including any notes
thereto and with respect to annual reports, an auditors' report by an
accounting firm of established national reputation, and a "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"
comparable to the disclosure that the Company would have been required to
include in annual and quarterly reports, information, documents or other
reports, including, without limitation, reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, if
the Company was subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

SECTION 4.6 Corporate Existence. Subject to Article Six, the
Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep
in full force and effect its corporate existence and the corporate, partnership
or other existence of each Subsidiary of the Company and the rights (charter
and statutory) and franchises of the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company;
provided, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such
corporate, partnership or other existence of any Subsidiary or any such right
or franchise, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine in the
exercise of its business judgment that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company or any Subsidiary and
that abandonment of any such right or franchise shall have no material adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the Holders.

or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or
property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies that, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the
property of the Company, or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any
such tax, assessment, charge or claim the amount, applicability or validity of
which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which an adequate reserve has been established by the Company to the

repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereto, all as
in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on
in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all
times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the
Company or any Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and maintenance of
any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in the good faith judgment of
the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, desirable in the conduct of
its respective business and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the
Holders.

SECTION 4.9 Maintenance of Insurance. The Company will insure
and keep insured, and will cause each Subsidiary to insure and keep insured,
with reputable insurance companies, such of their respective properties, to
such an extent and against such risks, and will maintain liability insurance,

companies engaged in a similar business and owning similar properties in
accordance with good business practice.

the foregoing, in respect of the conduct of their respective businesses and 
the ownership of their respective properties, except such as are being 
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and except for such 
noncompliance as would not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on 
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

SECTION 4.11 Change of Control.

(a) Upon a Change of Control, each Holder shall have the 
right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's

(b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the

delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is
withdrawing his election to have such Security purchased.

(d) On the purchase date, all Securities purchased by the
Company under this Section shall be delivered by the Company to the Trustee for
cancellation, together with an Officer's Certificate requesting such
cancellation and stating that they are being delivered for cancellation in

the purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Holders
entitled thereto.

(e) The Company shall comply with the requirements of
Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations

"prepayment"), directly or indirectly (including by way of amendment 
of the terms of any Indebtedness in connection with any retirement or 
acquisition of such Indebtedness), other than at any scheduled 
maturity thereof or by any scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking 
fund payment, any Indebtedness of the Company which is subordinated 
in right of payment to the Securities or which matures after the

27
<PAGE> 36
maturity date of the Securities (except out of the proceeds of
Refinancing Indebtedness);

if, at the time of such transaction described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii)
(such transactions being hereinafter collectively referred to as "Restricted
Payments") or after giving effect thereto, either (x) a Default or an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (y) the aggregate amount
expended by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Restricted Payments (the
amount of any Restricted Payment if other than cash to be the fair market value
of the property included in such payment as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors as evidenced by a Board Resolution) from and after the
Closing Date shall exceed the sum of (A) 50% (or, if the Securities at the time
of the proposed Restricted Payment are rated Investment Grade by both S&P and
Moody's, 75%) of the aggregate Adjusted Consolidated Net Income (or if such
Adjusted Consolidated Net Income is a loss, minus 100% of such loss) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the period from the first day of the first
quarter ended subsequent to the Closing Date and through the last day of the
most recently completed quarter immediately preceding the quarter in which the
Restricted Payment occurs, calculated on a cumulative basis as if such period
were a single accounting period; (B) the aggregate net proceeds received by the
Company after the Closing Date (including the fair market value of non-cash
proceeds as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors as evidenced by
a Board Resolution) from any Person other than a Subsidiary, as a result of the
issuance of (or contribution to capital on) Capital Stock of the Company (other
than any Redeemable Stock) or warrants, rights or options to acquire Capital
Stock (other than any Redeemable Stock); (C) the aggregate net proceeds
received by the Company after the Closing Date from any Person other than a
Subsidiary as a result of the issuance of Capital Stock (other than Redeemable
Stock) upon conversion or exchange of Indebtedness or upon exercise of options,
warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock and (D) $25,000,000.
For purposes of any calculation that is required to be made in respect of, or
after, the declaration of a dividend by the Company, such dividend shall be
deemed to be paid at the date of declaration and shall be included in
determining the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments.

For the purposes of this Section 4.13, the net proceeds from the
issuance of shares of Capital Stock of the Company upon conversion of debt
securities shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the net book value of such
debt securities (plus the additional amount required to be paid upon such
conversion, if any), less any cash payment on account of fractional shares; the
"net book value" of a security shall be the net amount received by the Company
on the issuance of such security, as adjusted on the books of the Company to
the date of conversion.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred or be continuing at the time or as a result
thereof, the provisions of this Section 4.13 shall not prohibit (i) the payment
of any dividend in respect of the Company's Capital Stock within 60 days after
the date of declaration thereof, if at such date of declaration such payment
complied with the provisions hereof; (ii) the purchase, redemption or other
acquisition or retirement for value of any shares of the Company's Capital
Stock or the

28
<PAGE> 37
prepayment of any indebtedness of the Company which is subordinated in right of
payment to the Securities or which matures after the maturity date of the
Securities by any exchange for, or out of and to the extent the Company has
received cash proceeds from the substantially concurrent sale or issuance
(other than to a Subsidiary) of, shares of Capital Stock (other than any
Redeemable Stock) of the Company or warrants, rights or options to acquire
Capital Stock (other than any Redeemable Stock); or (iii) the purchase or
redemption of shares of Capital Stock of the Company (including options on any
such shares or related stock appreciation rights or similar securities) held by
officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or their estates or
beneficiaries under their estates) upon death, disability, retirement,
termination of employment of any such Person pursuant to the terms of any Plan
or any other agreement under which such shares of stock or related rights were
issued; provided that the aggregate amount of such purchases or redemptions of
such Capital Stock shall not exceed $3,000,000 in any one fiscal year of the
Company. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of Restricted
Payments permitted under clause (y) of Section 4.13(a), all amounts expended
pursuant to clauses (i) (to the extent deemed to have been paid and already
included in determining the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments pursuant to
clause (y) of Section 4.13(a)), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph shall be
excluded.

Prior to making any Restricted Payment under this Section, the Company
shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the
computation by which the amount available for Restricted Payments was
determined. The Trustee shall have no duty or responsibility to determine the
accuracy or correctness of this computation or that the provisions of this
Section have been satisfied and shall be fully protected in relying on such
Officers' Certificate.

SECTION 4.14 Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.

(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall,
directly or indirectly (i) sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of
its properties or assets, or issue securities to, (ii) purchase any property,
assets or securities from, (iii) make any Investment in, or (iv) enter into or
suffer to exist any contract or agreement with or for the benefit of, an
Affiliate or holder of 5% or more of any class of Capital Stock (and any
Affiliate of such holder) of the Company (an "Affiliate Transaction"), other
than (x) Affiliate Transactions permitted under Section 4.14(b) and (y)
Affiliate Transactions (including lease transactions) which are on fair and
reasonable terms no less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary, as the
case may be, than those as might reasonably have been obtainable at such time
from an unaffiliated party; provided that if an Affiliate Transaction or series
of related Affiliate Transactions involves or has a value in excess of
$10,000,000, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall not
enter into such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions unless a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors of the Company or such Subsidiary shall reasonably and in good faith
determine that such Affiliate Transaction is fair to the Company or such
Subsidiary, as the case may be, or is on terms no less favorable to the Company
or such

29
<PAGE> 38
Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those as might reasonably have been
obtainable at such time from an unaffiliated party.

(b) The provisions of Section 4.14(a) shall not apply to (i) any
agreement as in effect as of the Closing Date, or any amendment thereto so long
as any such amendment is not disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect or any transaction contemplated thereby (including pursuant to any
amendment thereto); (ii) any transaction between the Company and any Wholly
Owned Subsidiary or between Wholly Owned Subsidiaries, provided such
transactions are not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture; (iii) reasonable
and customary fees and compensation paid to, and indemnity provided on behalf
of, officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Company or any
Subsidiary, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary or the senior management thereof in good faith; (iv) any Restricted
Payments not prohibited by Section 4.13; (v) any payments or other transactions
pursuant to any tax sharing agreement between the Company and any other Person
with which the Company is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax
return or with which the Company is or could be part of a consolidated group
for tax purposes; and (vi) transactions with Continental Airlines, Inc., Mesa
Airlines, Inc. and their respective Affiliates as contemplated by the Alliance
Agreements.

SECTION 4.15 Limitation on Asset Sales. Subject to the following
paragraphs of this Section, in the event and to the extent that on any date
after the Closing Date the Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive Net Cash
Proceeds from one or more Asset Sales (other than Asset Sales by the Company or
any Subsidiary to the Company or another Subsidiary), then the Company shall,
or shall cause such Subsidiary to, within 12 months after such date apply an
amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds (A) to repay Indebtedness of the Company
or Indebtedness of any Subsidiary, in each case owing to a Person other than
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and/or (B) as an Investment (or enter
into a definitive agreement committing to so invest within 12 months after the
date of such agreement), in property or assets of a nature or type or that are
used in a business (or in a Person having property and assets of a nature or
type, or engaged in a business) similar or related to the nature or type of the
property and assets of, or the business of, the Company and its Subsidiaries
existing on the date thereof (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, whose
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution). The
amount of such Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied (or to be committed to
be applied) during such 12-month period as set forth in clause (A) or (B) of
the preceding sentence shall constitute "Excess Proceeds."

If on the first Business Day following any 12-month period referred to
in the preceding paragraph, the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds from all
Asset Sales, not previously applied as provided in clause (A) or (B) of the
preceding paragraph, exceeds $15,000,000, the Company, within 10 Business Days
after the end of such 12-month period, make an offer to purchase on a pro rata
basis from all Holders (an "Excess Proceeds Offer"), and shall purchase from
Holders accepting such Excess Proceeds Offer, the maximum principal amount
(expressed as an integral multiple of $1,000) of Securities that may be

30
<PAGE> 39
purchased from funds in an amount equal to all such outstanding Excess Proceeds
at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities so
purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon (if any) to the date of
purchase ("Excess Proceeds Payment"). Upon completion of an Excess Proceeds
Offer (or upon termination of such offer if no repurchases are required), the
amount of such Excess Proceeds relating thereto shall be equal to zero.

The Company shall commence an Excess Proceeds Offer by causing the
Trustee to mail a notice to each Holder stating: (i) that the Excess Proceeds
Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 4.15 and that all Securities
validly tendered will be accepted for purchase; provided, however, that if the
aggregate purchase price of Securities tendered in an Excess Proceeds Offer
(including accrued interest to the date of purchase) exceeds the aggregate
amount of the Excess Proceeds required to be applied in such Excess Proceeds
Offer, the Company shall select the Securities to be purchased on a pro rata
basis (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so
that only Securities in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof
shall be purchased); (ii) the purchase price (including the amount of accrued
interest) and the purchase date (which shall be a Business Day no earlier than
30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the
"Excess Proceeds Purchase Date"); (iii) that any Security not tendered will
continue to accrue interest pursuant to its terms; (iv) that, unless the
Company defaults in the purchase of such Security on the Excess Proceeds
Purchase Date, any Security accepted for purchase pursuant to the Excess
Proceeds Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Excess Proceeds
Purchase Date; (v) that Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant
to the Excess Proceeds Offer will be required to surrender the Security,
together with the form entitled "Option of the Holder to Elect Purchase" on the
reverse side of the Security completed, to the Paying Agent at the address
specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Excess Proceeds Purchase Date; (vi) that each Holder
will be entitled to withdraw its election (in whole but not in part) if the
Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the third
Business Day immediately preceding the Excess Proceeds Purchase Date, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of
such Holder, the principal amount of Securities delivered for purchase and a
statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Securities
purchased; and (vii) that Holders whose Securities are being purchased only in
part will be issued new Securities equal in aggregate principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered.

On the Excess Proceeds Purchase Date, the Company shall: (i) accept
for purchase on a pro rata basis Securities or portions thereof tendered
pursuant to the Excess Proceeds Offer; (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent money
sufficient to pay the purchase price of all Securities or portions thereof so
accepted; and (iii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee all
Securities or portions thereof so accepted together with an Officers'
Certificate specifying the Securities or portions thereof accepted for purchase
by the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to the Holders of
Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price, and
the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail
to each such Holder a new Security equal in principal amount

31
<PAGE> 40
to any unpurchased portion of the Security surrendered; provided that each
Security purchased and each new Security delivered shall be in a principal
amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The Company will publicly
announce the results of the Excess Proceeds Offer as soon as practicable after
the Excess Proceeds Purchase Date. For purposes of this Section 4.15, the
Trustee shall act as the Paying Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(i) to the extent that any or all of the Net Cash
Proceeds of any Asset Sale are prohibited or delayed by applicable
local law from being repatriated to the United States of America, the
portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to
be applied pursuant to this Section 4.14 but may be retained for so
long, but only for so long, as the applicable local law will not
permit repatriation to the United States of America (the Company
hereby agrees to promptly take all reasonable actions required by the
applicable local law to permit such repatriation) and once such
repatriation of any such affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under
the applicable local law, such repatriation will be immediately
effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be applied in the
manner set forth in this Section 4.15 as if such Asset Sale had
occurred on the date of repatriation; and

(ii) to the extent that the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all
of the Net Cash Proceeds would have an adverse tax consequence to the
Company, the Net Cash Proceeds so affected may be retained outside the
United States of America for so long as such adverse tax consequences
would continue.

The Company will comply with Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and any other securities laws and regulations
thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable, in the event
that such Excess Proceeds are received by the Company as contemplated by this
Section 4.15 and the Company is required to repurchase Securities as described
above.

SECTION 4.16 Limitation on Payment Restrictions Affecting
Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to,
create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Payment
Restriction or consensual encumbrance with respect to any Subsidiary thereof to
(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions on such Subsidiary's Capital
Stock; (b) make any loans or advances to the Company or any other Subsidiary;
or (c) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any other
Subsidiary except (i) restrictions imposed by applicable law; (ii) any
restrictions existing under this Indenture; and (iii) encumbrances or
restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument (A) relating to any
property acquired or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date, provided that such encumbrance or restriction relates only to the
property which is acquired or leased; (B) relating to any Indebtedness of any
Subsidiary at the date of acquisition of such Subsidiary by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, provided that such Indebtedness was not incurred in
connection with, or in

32
<PAGE> 41
contemplation of, such acquisition (the Company being entitled to rely upon a
certificate of such Subsidiary as to whether such Indebtedness was incurred in
contemplation thereof); (C) arising pursuant to an agreement effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness issued pursuant to an agreement referred to in the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), so long as the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such refinancing agreement are no more restrictive than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in such agreements; (D) which
constitute customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of any
lease of the Company or any Subsidiary or provisions in agreements that
restrict the assignment of such agreement or any rights thereunder; and (E)
which constitute restrictions on the sale or other disposition of any property
securing Indebtedness as a result of a lien on such property.

SECTION 4.17 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

SECTION 4.18 Limitation on Investments. The Company shall not,
and shall not permit any Subsidiary to make any Investment other than (i)
Investments consisting of non-cash proceeds from Asset Sales as contemplated by
Section 4.15 of this Indenture; (ii) Investments consisting of Cash
Equivalents; (iii) accounts receivable if credited or acquired in the ordinary
course of business and payable or dischargeable in accordance with customary
trade terms; (iv) payroll advances and advances for business and travel
expenses in the ordinary course of business; (v) Investments by the Company in
its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; (vi) Investments by any
Subsidiary of the Company in the Company or in any Subsidiary; (vii)
Investments by the Company for the purpose of acquiring businesses reasonably
related to the business of the Company, in an aggregate amount not exceeding
$5,000,000 in any fiscal year of the Company; (viii) Investments made by way of
any endorsement of negotiable instruments received by the Company or any
Subsidiary in the ordinary course of its business and presented by it to any
bank for collection or deposit; (ix) stock, obligations or securities received
in settlement of debts created in the ordinary course of business owing to the
company or any Subsidiary; (x) Investments by the Company in any Subsidiary for
the purpose of receivables financing; and (xi) in addition to any other
permitted investments, any other Investments by the Company in an aggregate
amount not exceeding $1,000,000 at any time.

SECTION 4.19 Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws. The
Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not
at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take
the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or
other law that would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any
portion of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities as
contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force,
or that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to
the extent that it may lawfully do so) the Company hereby expressly waives all
benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder,
delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but
will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law
had been enacted.

ARTICLE FIVE - SECURITYHOLDERS LISTS AND
REPORTS BY COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE

SECTION 5.1 The Company to Furnish Trustee Information as to
Names and Addresses of Securityholders. If and so long as the Trustee shall
not be the Security registrar for the Securities, the Company covenants and
agrees that it will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee a list in
such form as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of
the Holders of the Securities pursuant to Section 312 of the TIA:

(a) semiannually and not more than 15 days after each
record date for the payment of interest on such Securities, as hereinabove
specified and as of such record date, and

(b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in
writing, within 30 days after receipt by the Company of any such request as of
a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such information is furnished.

SECTION 5.2 Disclosure of Names and Addresses of Securityholders. 
Each and every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees 
with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor 
any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of 
the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the 
Holders of Securities in accordance with Section 312 of the TIA, regardless of 
the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall 
not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request 
made under Section 312(b) of the TIA.

SECTION 5.3 Reports by the Trustee. Any Trustee's report
required under Section 313(m) of the TIA shall be transmitted on or before May

ARTICLE SIX - CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, CONVEYANCE OR TRANSFER 

SECTION 6.1 Merger or Consolidation. The Company shall not
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or convey, lease or
transfer its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person,
unless:

(a) the corporation formed by such consolidation or
into which the Company is merged or the Person that acquires by conveyance,
lease or transfer the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an
entirety shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the
United States of America or any State or the District of Columbia, and shall
expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered
to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the Company's

34
<PAGE> 43
obligation for the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on
all the Securities according to their tenor and the performance of every
covenant of this Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or
observed;

(b) immediately before and after giving effect to such
transaction, no Event of Default, and no event that, after notice or lapse of
time, or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be
continuing; and

(c) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such
consolidation, merger, conveyance, lease or transfer and such supplemental
indenture comply with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein
provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.

This Section shall only apply to a merger or consolidation in which
the Company is not the surviving corporation and to conveyances, leases, and
transfers by the Company, as transferee or lessor.

SECTION 6.2 Successor Corporation Substituted. Upon any
consolidation or merger by the Company with or into any other corporation, or
any conveyance or transfer by the Company of its properties and assets
substantially as an entirety to any Person, in accordance with Section 6.1, the
successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is
merged or to which such conveyance or transfer is made shall succeed to, and be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under
this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor corporation had been
named as the Company and in the event of any such conveyance or transfer, the
Company, except in the event of a conveyance by way of lease, shall be
discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the
Securities and may be dissolved and liquidated. Such successor corporation may
cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the
Company prior to such succession, any or all of the Securities issuable
hereunder that theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and
delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor corporation,
instead of the Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations
in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver
any Securities that previously shall have been signed and delivered by the
officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities
that such successor corporation thereafter shall, cause to be signed and
delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the Securities so issued shall
in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as
the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of
this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of
the execution hereof.

In case of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer,
such changes in phrasing and form (but not in substance) may be made in the
Securities that may be endorsed thereon, as the case may be, thereafter to be
delivered as may be appropriate.

AND SECURITYHOLDERS ON EVENT OF DEFAULT

SECTION 7.1 Event of Default Defined; Acceleration of Maturity;
Waiver of Default. "Event of Default", with respect to the Securities, means
any one of the following events that shall have occurred and be continuing
(whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be
voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any
judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body):

(a) default in the payment of the principal of or
premium (if any) on any Security when the same becomes due and payable
at maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise;

(b) default in the payment of interest on any Security
when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for
a period of 30 days;

(c) the Company defaults in the performance of or
breaches any other covenant or agreement of the Company in this
Indenture or under the Securities and such default or breach continues
for a period of 30 consecutive days after the date on which written
notice specifying such failure, stating that such notice is a "Notice
of Default" under the Indenture and demanding that the Company remedy
the same, shall have been given by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the Company by the Trustee or to the
Company and the Trustee by the Holders of 25% or more in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities Outstanding;

(d) there occurs with respect to any issue or issues of
Indebtedness of the Company and/or one or more Subsidiaries having an
outstanding principal amount of $10 million or more in the aggregate
for all such issues of all such Persons, whether such Indebtedness now
exists or shall hereafter be created, an event of default that has
caused the holder thereof to declare such Indebtedness to be due and
payable prior to its Stated Maturity and such Indebtedness has not
been discharged in full or such acceleration has not been rescinded or
annulled within 30 days of such acceleration;

(e) any final judgment or order (not covered by
insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $10 million in the
aggregate for all such final judgments or orders against all such
Persons (treating any deductibles, self-insurance or retention as not
so covered) shall be rendered against the Company or any Subsidiary
and shall not be discharged, and there shall be any period of 60
consecutive days following entry of the final judgment or order that
causes the aggregate amount for all such final judgments or orders
outstanding against all such Persons to exceed $10 million during
which a stay of enforcement of such final judgment or order, by reason
of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect;

36
<PAGE> 45
(f) a court having jurisdiction in the premises enters
a decree or order for (i) relief in respect of the Company or any
Material Subsidiary in an involuntary case under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, (ii) appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or
any Material Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the
property and assets of the Company or any Material Subsidiary or (iii)
the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company or any
Material Subsidiary and, in each case, such decree or order shall
remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days;

(g) the Company or any Material Subsidiary (i)
commences a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consents to the
entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such
law, (ii) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or
similar official of the Company or any Material Subsidiary or for all
or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company or any
Material Subsidiary or (iii) effects any general assignment for the
benefit of creditors of the Company or any Material Subsidiary;

(h) the Company and/or one or more Subsidiaries fail to
make at the final (but not any interim) fixed maturity of one or more
issues of Indebtedness a principal payment or principal payments
aggregating more than $10 million and all such defaulted payments
shall not have been made, waived or extended within 30 days of the
payment default that caused the aggregate amount of such defaulted
payments to exceed $10 million; or

(i) any of the Applicable Documents shall cease, for
any reason, to be in full force and effect in any material respect,
except as a result of an amendment, waiver or termination thereof as
contemplated or permitted therein.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
clause (f) or (g) above that occurs with respect to the Company) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding, by written notice to the
Company (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders (the
"Acceleration Notice")), may, and the Trustee at the request of the Holders
shall, declare the entire unpaid principal, premium (if any) and accrued
interest on the Securities to be immediately due and payable as specified
below. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such principal, premium (if any)
and accrued interest shall be immediately due and payable. In the event of a
declaration of acceleration because an Event of Default set forth in clause (d)
above has occurred and is continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be
automatically rescinded and annulled if the event of default triggering such
Event of Default shall be remedied, cured by the Company or waived by the
holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 30 days after the occurrence of the
Event of Default with respect thereto and the Company has delivered an
Officer's Certificate as to such effect. If an Event of Default specified in
clause (f) or (g) above occurs with respect to the Company, all unpaid
principal

37
<PAGE> 46
of, premium (if any) and accrued interest on the Securities then outstanding
shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without declaration
or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may
waive all past defaults and rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and
its consequences if (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the
non-payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Securities
that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been
cured or waived and (ii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any Notice of Default pursuant to this
Section 7.1 with respect to Securities all or part of which are represented by
a Global Security, a record date shall be established for determining Holders
of Outstanding Securities entitled to join in such Notice of Default, which
record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Trustee receives
such Notice of Default. The Holders on such record date, or their duly
designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such
Notice of Default, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record
date; provided, that unless Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities, or their proxies, shall have joined in such Notice of
Default prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such Notice
of Default shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be
cancelled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a
Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day
period, a new Notice of Default identical to a Notice of Default which has been
cancelled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a
new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section
7.1.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any Acceleration Notice or any
rescission and annulment thereof, with respect to Securities all or part of
which are represented by a Global Security, a record date shall be established
for determining Holders of Outstanding Securities entitled to join in such
notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the
Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly
designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such
notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;
provided, that unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and
annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the
requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90
days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration or
rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without
further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect. Nothing in
this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving,
after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of
acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is
identical to a written notice which has been cancelled pursuant to the proviso
to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be
established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.1.

SECTION 7.2 Collection of Indebtedness by Trustee; Trustee May
Prove Debt. The Company covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in
the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities when such
interest shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have
continued for a period of 30 days or (b) in case default shall be made in the
payment of all or any part of the principal of any of the Securities when the
same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities
or upon any redemption or by declaration or otherwise, then upon demand of the
Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of
the Securities the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable an
all Securities for principal or interest, as the case may be (with interest to
the date of such payment upon the overdue principal and, to the extent that
payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue
installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest specified in
the Securities); and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable
compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their respective
agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses and liabilities incurred, and
all advances made by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as a
result of its negligence or bad faith.

Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the Company may pay the
principal of and interest on the Securities to the registered Holders, whether
or not the Securities are overdue.

In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such
demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall
be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in
equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any
such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any
such judgment or final decree against the Company or other obligor upon the
Securities and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the
Company or other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated the monies
adjudged or decreed to be payable.

In case there shall be pending proceedings relative to the Company or
any other obligor upon the Securities under Title 11 of the United States Code
or any other applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or
reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been
appointed for or taken possession of the Company or the property of the Company
or such other obligor, or in case of any other judicial proceedings relative to
the Company or other obligor upon the Securities, or to the creditors or
property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of
whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as
therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether
the Trustee will have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this
Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings
or otherwise:

(a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole
amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the
Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the

39
<PAGE> 48
Trustee (including any claim for reasonable compensation to the
Trustee and each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents,
attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and
liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each
predecessor Trustee, except as a result of negligence or bad faith)
and of the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings
relative to the Company or other obligor upon the Securities, or to
the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor,

(b) unless prohibited by applicable law and
regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders of the Securities in any
election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement,
reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency
proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable
proceedings, and

(c) to collect and receive any monies or other property
payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all
amounts received with respect to the claims of the Securityholders and
of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee, receiver, or
liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby authorized
by each of the Securityholders to make payments to the Trustee, and,
in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments
directly to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as
shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee,
each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and
counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all
advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as a
result of negligence or bad faith.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to
authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in
any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee
in bankruptcy or similar person.

All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or
under any of the Securities may be enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any trial or
other proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or proceedings
instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an
express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the
expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each predecessor
Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable
benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has
been recovered.

In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings
involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the
Holders of the Securities in respect of which such

40
<PAGE> 49
action was taken, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such
Securities parties to any such proceedings.

SECTION 7.3 Application of Proceeds. Any monies collected by
the Trustee pursuant to this Article Seven in respect of the Securities shall
be applied in the following order at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee
and, in the case of the distribution of such monies on account of principal or
interest, upon presentation of the several Securities in respect of which
monies have been collected and stamping (or otherwise noting) thereon the
payment, or issuing Securities in reduced principal amounts in exchange for the
presented Securities if only partially paid, or upon surrender thereof if fully
paid:

FIRST: To the payment of amounts due the Trustee or any
predecessor Trustee under Section 8.6;

SECOND: In case the principal of the Securities shall not
have become and be then due and payable, to the payment of interest on
the Securities in default in the order of the maturity of the
installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such
interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue
installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest
specified in the Securities, such payments to be made ratably to the
persons entitled thereto, without discrimination or preference;

THIRD: In case the principal of the Securities shall have
become and shall be then due and payable, to the payment of the whole
amount then owing and unpaid upon all the Securities for principal and
interest, with interest upon the overdue principal, and (to the extent
that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue
installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest
specified in the Securities and in case such monies shall be
insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid upon
the Securities, then to the payment of such principal and interest
without preference or priority of principal over interest or of
interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any
other installment of interest, or of any Security over any other
Security, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and
unpaid interest; and

FOURTH: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the
Company or any other person lawfully entitled thereto.

SECTION 7.4 Suits for Enforcement. In case an Event of Default
has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this
Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem
most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in
equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of
any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise
of any power granted in this Indenture or to enforce any other legal or
equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.

41
<PAGE> 50
SECTION 7.5 Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of
Proceedings. In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right
under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the
Trustee, then and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be
restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all
rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Trustee and the Securityholders
shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.

SECTION 7.6 Limitations on Suits by Securityholders. A Holder
of Securities may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the
Securities unless; (i) such Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default; (ii) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Securities make a written request to the
Trustee to pursue the remedy; (iii) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any costs, liability or expense;
(iv) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt
of the request and the offer of indemnity; and (v) during such 60-day period,
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Securities do not give the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with the
request.

For purposes of this Section 7.6, the Trustee shall comply with
Section 316(a) of the TIA in making any determination of whether the Holders of
the required aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities have
concurred in any request or direction of the Trustee to pursue any remedy
available to the Trustee or the Holders with respect to this Indenture or the
Securities or otherwise under the law.

A Holder of Securities may not use this Indenture to prejudice the
rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over such other
Holder.

SECTION 7.7 Unconditional Right of Securityholders to Institute
Certain Suits. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture and any
provision of any Security, the right of any Holder of any Security to receive
payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on such Security on
or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security, or to institute
suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates,
shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 7.8 Powers and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission
Not Waiver of Default. Except as provided in Section 7.6, no right or remedy
herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended
to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall,
to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other
right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

42
<PAGE> 51
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any
right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as
aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to
Section 7.6, every power and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the
Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as
shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders.

SECTION 7.9 Control by Holders of Securities. The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time
outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the
Securities by this Indenture; provided, that such direction shall not be
otherwise than in accordance with law and the provisions of this Indenture; and
provided, further, that (subject to the provisions of Section 8.1) the Trustee
shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee,
being advised by counsel, shall determine that the action or proceeding so
directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board
of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or
Responsible Officers of the Trustee shall determine that the action or
proceedings so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or if
the Trustee in good faith shall so determine that the actions or forbearance
specified in or pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the
interests of Holders not joining in the giving of said direction. It being
understood that (subject to Section 8.1) the Trustee shall have no duty to
ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearance are unduly prejudicial to
such Holders.

Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right of the Trustee in its
discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and that is not
inconsistent with such direction or directions by the Holders.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any written notice directing the time,
method or place of conducting any such proceeding or exercising any such trust
or power, with respect to Securities all or part of which are represented by a
Global Security, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of
Outstanding Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall
be at the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such notice. The
Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such
Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders
remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities shall have joined in
such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such
notice shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be
cancelled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a
Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day
period, a new notice identical to a notice which has been cancelled pursuant to
the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall
be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.9.

43
<PAGE> 52
SECTION 7.10 Waiver of Past Defaults. Subject to Sections 7.1
and 7.7, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Securities, by notice to the Trustee, may waive an existing Event
of Default and its consequences, except a default in the payment of principal
of or interest on any Security as specified in clause (a) or (b) of Section
7.1.

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for
the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive any past default
hereunder. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or
their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to
waive any default hereunder, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after
such record date; provided, that unless such majority in principal amount shall
have waived such default prior to the date which is 90 days after such record
date, any such waiver previously given shall automatically and without further
action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect.

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist and be deemed
to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, and not to have occurred for
every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default at Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

SECTION 7.11 Trustees to Give Notice of Default, But May
Withhold in Certain Circumstances. The Trustee shall, within ninety days after
the occurrence of a Default with respect to the Securities, give notice of all
Defaults known to the Trustee to all Holders of Securities in the manner and to
the extent provided in Section 313(c) of the TIA, unless in each case such
Defaults shall have been cured before the mailing or publication of such
notice; provided, however, that, except in the case of Default in the payment
of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities, the Trustee shall be
protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors,
the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees or
Responsible Officers of the Trustee, or any combination of the foregoing, in
good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests
of the Securityholders.

SECTION 7.12 Right of Court to Require Filing of Undertaking to
Pay Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any
Security by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any
court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any
right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any
action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party
litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that
such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to
the merit and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant;
but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by
the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder or group of
Securityholders holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for
the enforcement of the payment

44
<PAGE> 53
of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the due date
expressed in such Security or any date fixed for redemption.

ARTICLE EIGHT - CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

SECTION 8.1 Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During
Default; Prior to Default. With respect to the Holders of the Securities
issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default
with respect to the Securities and after the curing or waiving of all Events of
Default that may have occurred, has undertaken to perform such duties and only
such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event
of Default with respect to the Securities has occurred (that has not been cured
or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to such Securities such of
the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree
of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use
under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act or its own wilful misconduct, except that:

(a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default
with respect to the Securities and after the curing or waiving of all
such Events of Default with respect to such Securities that may have
occurred:

(i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee
with respect to the Securities shall be determined solely by
the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee
shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties
and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

(ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of
the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the
truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions
expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or
opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the
requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such
statements, certificates or opinions that by any provision
hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the
Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same
to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements
of this Indenture;

(b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of
judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible
Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee
was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

45
<PAGE> 54
(c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
accordance with the direction of the Holders pursuant to Section 7.9
relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or
power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.

None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that
the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this
Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording
protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

The provisions of this Section 8.1 are in furtherance of and subject to Section
315 of the TIA.

SECTION 8.2 Certain Rights of the Trustee. In furtherance of and
subject to the TIA, and subject to Section 8.1:

(a) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in
acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, Officers'
Certificate or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, note,
coupon, security or other paper or document believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties;

(b) any request, direction, order or demand of the
Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an
Officers' Certificate of the Company (unless other evidence in respect
thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any resolution of the
Board of Directors of the Company may be evidenced to the Trustee by a
copy thereof certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of
the Company;

(c) the Trustee may consult with counsel and any written 
advice or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered
or omitted to be taken by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance
thereon in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

(d) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise 
any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the 
request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant
to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall
have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against
the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred therein or
thereby;

46
<PAGE> 55
(e) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be
authorized or within the discretion, rights or powers conferred upon
it by this Indenture; and

(f) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default
hereunder and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default,
the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the
facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
approval, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security, or other
paper or document unless requested in writing to so do by the Holders
of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities then Outstanding; provided, however, that, if the payment
within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses, or
liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such
investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably
assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of
this Indenture, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against
such expenses or liabilities as a condition to proceeding; the
reasonable expenses of every such investigation shall be paid by the
Company or, if paid by the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee, shall
be repaid by the Company upon demand.

SECTION 8.3 Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals, Disposition
of Securities or Application of Proceeds Thereof. The recitals contained
herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of
authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company and the Trustee
assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes
no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the
Securities. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by
the Company of any of the Securities or of the proceeds thereof.

The Trustee shall have no duty to inquire as to the performance of the
Company's covenants in Article Four hereof. In addition, the Trustee shall not
be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default, except (i) any
Default or Event of Default occurring pursuant to Section 7.1(a), 7.1(b) or
4.1, or (ii) any Default or Event of Default of which the Trustee shall have
received written notification or obtained actual knowledge.

SECTION 8.4 Trustee and Agents May Hold Securities; Collections, 
etc. The Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, in its 
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of
Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or
such agent and may otherwise deal with the Company and receive, collect, hold
and retain collections from the Company with the same rights it would have if
it were not the Trustee or such agent.

SECTION 8.5 Monies Held by Trustee. Subject to the provisions
of Section 11.4 hereof, all monies received by the Trustee shall, until used or
applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they
were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent
required by mandatory provisions of law. Neither the

47
<PAGE> 56
Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be under any
liability for interest on any monies received by it hereunder.

SECTION 8.6 Compensation and Indemnification of Trustee and
Its Prior Claim. The Company covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from
time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, reasonable compensation
(which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the
compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and the Company covenants and
agrees to pay or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee upon its
request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or
made by or on behalf of it in accordance with any of the provisions of this
Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and
disbursements of its counsel and of all agents and other persons not regularly
in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise
from its negligence or bad faith. The Company also covenants to indemnify the
Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense incurred, without negligence or bad faith on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
this Indenture or the trusts hereunder and its duties hereunder, including the
costs and expenses of defending itself against or investigating any claim of
liability in the premises. The obligations of the Company under this Section
to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee and to pay
or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for expenses,
disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness of the
Company hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture. Such additional indebtedness shall be a senior claim to that of the
Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as
such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular
Securities, and the Securities are hereby subordinated to such senior claim.

SECTION 8.7 Right of Trustee to Rely on Officers' Certificate,
etc. Subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, whenever in the administration of this
Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be
proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action
hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein
specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an
Officers' Certificate of the Company delivered to the Trustee, and such
certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

SECTION 8.8 Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee. The
Trustee shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under
the laws of the United States of America or of any State or the District of
Columbia, or a corporation or other Person permitted to act as Trustee by the
Commission pursuant to the TIA, having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $50,000,000, and that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trust powers and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State or
District of Columbia authority. Such corporation shall have an address or
agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for the presentment of
Securities. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the

48
<PAGE> 57
requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the
purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation
shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most
recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall
cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the
Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in
Section 8.9.

The provisions of this Section 8.8 are in furtherance of and subject
to Section 310(a) of the TIA.

SECTION 8.9 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor Trustee.

(a) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter
appointed, may at any time resign by giving written notice of
resignation to the Company and by mailing notice of such resignation
to the Holders of then Outstanding Securities at their addresses as
they shall appear on the registry books. Upon receiving such notice
of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee
or trustees by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority
of the Board of Directors of the Company, one copy of which instrument
shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the
successor trustee or trustees. If no successor trustee shall have
been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after
the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide
Holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may,
subject to the provisions of Section 8.12, on behalf of itself and all
others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment
of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice,
if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor
trustee.

(b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:

(i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the
provisions of Section 310(b) of the TIA with respect to the
Securities after written request therefor by the Company or by
any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security or Securities for at least six months; or

(ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.8 and Section
310(a) of the TIA and shall fail to resign after written
request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder; or

(iii) the Trustee shall become incapable
of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a
receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall
be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or
control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the
purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;

49
<PAGE> 58
then, in any such case, unless the Trustee's duty to resign has been stayed as
provided pursuant to Section 310(b) of the TIA, the Company may remove the
Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate,
executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Company, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the
successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 315(e) of the TIA,
any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities
of such series for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others
similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court
may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe,
remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.

(c) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding may at any time
remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by delivering to
the Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed, and to
the Company the evidence provided for in Section 9.1 of the action in
that regard taken by the Securityholders.

(d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and any
appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions
of this Section 8.9 shall become effective upon acceptance of
appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 8.10.

SECTION 8.10 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee.
Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 8.9 shall execute and
deliver to the Company and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting
such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor Trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without
any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights,
powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect
as if originally named as trustee hereunder; but nevertheless, on the written
request of the Company or of the successor trustee, upon payment of its charges
then unpaid, the Trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 11.4, pay
over to the successor trustee all monies at the time held by it hereunder and
shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee
all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such
successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing
for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
trustee all such rights and powers. Any Trustee ceasing to act shall,
nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected
by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of
Section 8.6.

No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided to this
Section 8.10 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall
be qualified under Section 310(b) of the TIA and eligible under the provisions
of Section 8.8.

50
<PAGE> 59
Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in
this Section 8.10, the Company shall give notice thereof to the Holders of
Securities, by mailing such notice to such Holders at their addresses as they
shall appear on the registry books. If the acceptance of appointment is
substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for
by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section
8.9. If the Company fails to give such notice within ten days after acceptance
of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such
notice to be given at the expense of the Company.

SECTION 8.11 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to
Business of Trustee. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a
party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of the
Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder; provided, however,
that such corporation shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the TIA and
eligible under the provisions of Section 8.8, without the execution or filing
of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the
trust created by this Indenture any of the Securities shall have been
authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt
the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such
Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities
shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may
authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor Trustee
hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such
certificate shall have the full force that it has anywhere in the Securities or
in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have;
provided, however, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of
any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities in the name of any
predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger,
conversion or consolidation.

SECTION 8.12 Preferential Collection of Claims Against the
Company. The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the TIA. Any Trustee
that has resigned or been removed is subject to Section 311(s) of the TIA to
the extent indicated therein.

SECTION 8.13 Appointment of Authenticating Agent. As long as
any Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee may, by an instrument in
writing, appoint an authenticating agent (the "Authenticating Agent") that
shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities,
including Securities issued upon exchange, registration of transfer, partial
redemption or pursuant to Section 2.5. Securities authenticated by such
Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and
shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the
Trustee. Whenever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication
and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or to the Trustee's Certificate of
Authentication (including, without limitation, in Section 2.3), such reference
shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee
by

51
<PAGE> 60
an Authenticating Agent and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf
of the Trustee by such Authenticating Agent. Such Authenticating Agent shall
at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of
the United States of America or of any State or the District of Columbia,
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $5,000,000 (determined as provided in
Section 8.8 with respect to the Trustee) and subject to supervision or
examination by Federal or State authority.

Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency
business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating
Agent with respect to all Securities for which it served as Authenticating
Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent. Any Authenticating Agent may
at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible shall, resign by giving
written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company.

Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a
termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.13, the Trustee
shall upon receipt of an Company Order appoint a successor Authenticating Agent
and the Company shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders in the
manner and to the extent provided in Section 12.4. Any successor
Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become
vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent.
The Company agrees to pay to the Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation. The Authenticating Agent for the Securities shall
have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the
direction of the Trustee.

Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.6, 8.8 and 9.3 shall be applicable to any
Authenticating Agent as if each reference to "Trustee" therein referred to the
Authenticating Agent.

ARTICLE NINE - CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS

SECTION 9.1 Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders. Any
request demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified
percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders may be embodied in and
evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by
such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly
appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such
action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered
to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing
appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for

52
<PAGE> 61
any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2) conclusive
in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this
Article Nine.

SECTION 9.2 Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding
of Securities. Subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, the execution of any
instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in the
following manner:

(a) The fact and date of the execution by any Holder
of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary
public or other officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take
acknowledgments of deeds or administer oaths that the person executing
such instruments acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an
affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such
notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by or on behalf
of any legal entity other than an individual, such certificate or
affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of the authority of
the person executing the same.

(b) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the
Security register or by a certificate of the Security registrar.

The Company may set a record date for purposes of determining the
identity of Holders of Securities entitled to vote or consent to any action
referred to in Section 9.1, which record date may be set at any time or from
time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of
any adjournment or reconsideration not more than 60 days nor less than five
days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter,
notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, only Holders of Securities of
record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or
revoke such vote or comment.

SECTION 9.3 Holders to be Treated as Owners. The Company, the
Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the
person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security
register as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security
shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing
thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal
of, premium (if any) and interest on such Security and for all other purposes,
and neither the Company or the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the
Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

SECTION 9.4 Securities Owned by the Company Deemed Not
Outstanding. In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate
principal amount of Outstanding Securities have concurred in any direction,
consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities that are owned by the
Company or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such
determination is being made or by any Affiliate of the Company or any other
obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being
made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of
any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the
Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver
only Securities that the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so

53
<PAGE> 62
disregarded. Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be
regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the
Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that
the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any
person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or
indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor on the
Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall
be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance
with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to
the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all
Securities, if any, known by the Company, to be owned or held by or for the
account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 8.1 and
8.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as
conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all
Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such
determination.

SECTION 9.5 Right of Revocation of Action Taken. At any time
prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section
9.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities specified in this Indenture in connection
with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown
by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the
Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at
the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this
Article Nine, revoke such action so far as it concerns such Security. Except
as aforesaid, any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be
conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners
of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange of substitution
therefor or on registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not
any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action
taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be
conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of all the
Securities affected by such action.

ARTICLE TEN - AMENDMENTS

SECTION 10.1 Amendments and Supplements Permitted Without Consent of
Holders.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 10.2, the Company and the
Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities
without the consent of any Holder to: (i) cure any ambiguity, correct
or supplement any provisions herein which may be inconsistent with any
other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect
to matters or questions arising under this Indenture which shall not
be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture; provided that
such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of the Holders;
(ii) provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place
of certificated Securities; (iii) evidence the succession of another
corporation to the Company and provide for the assumption by such
successor

54
<PAGE> 63
of the Company's obligations to the Holders hereunder and under the
Notes as permitted under Article Six; (iv) make any change that would
(1) provide any additional rights or benefits to Holders or (2) not
adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any Holder,
or (v) comply with the requirements of the Commission in order to
effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA.

(b) Upon the Company's request, after receipt by the
Trustee of a resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing the
execution of any amended or supplemental indenture, and the documents
described in Section 10.6, the Trustee shall join with the Company in
the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or
permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further
appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be contained in any
such amended or supplemental indenture, but the Trustee shall not be
obligated to enter into an amended or supplemental indenture that
affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or
otherwise.

SECTION 10.2 Amendments and Supplements Requiring Consent of Holders.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.1(a)
and 10.2(c), this Indenture and the Securities may be amended or
supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Securities (including consents obtained in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer for the Securities), and any existing Default
or Event of Default or non-compliance with any provision of the
Indenture or the Securities may be waived with the consent of Holders
of at least a majority in principal of the then outstanding Securities
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer for the Securities).

(b) Upon the Company's request and after receipt by
the Trustee of a resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing the
execution of any supplemental indenture, evidence of the Holders'
consent, and the documents described in Section 10.6, the Trustee
shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or
supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture
affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this
Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its
discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or
supplemental indenture.

(c) Without the consent of each Holder affected, no
amendment, supplement or waiver to this Indenture shall: (i) reduce
the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Indenture on
the Securities, (ii) reduce the principal of or change the fixed
maturity of any Security, or alter the provisions with respect to the
redemption of the Securities in a manner adverse to the Holders, (iii)
reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any
Security, (iv) waive a Default or

55
<PAGE> 64
Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or premium (if any)
or interest on, the Securities (except that Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Securities may (1) rescind an acceleration of the Securities that
resulted from a non-payment default, and (2) waive the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration), (v) make any Security payable
in money other than U.S. Legal Tender, (vi) make any change in the
provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
the rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of, or premium
(if any) or interest on, the Securities, (vii) waive a redemption
payment with respect to any Security, or (ix) make any change in
Section 7.7, Section 7.10 or this sentence.

(d) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to,
fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled
to consent to any indenture supplemental hereto. If a record date is
fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated
proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such
supplemental indenture, whether or not such Holders remain Holders
after such record date; provided, that unless such consent shall have
become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having been
obtained prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date,
any such consent previously given shall automatically and without
further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect.

(e) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the
Holders under this Section 10.2 to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such
consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment,
supplement or waiver under this Section 10.2 becomes effective, the
Company shall mail to each Holder affected thereby a notice briefly
describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the
Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not,
however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended
or supplemental indenture or waiver.

SECTION 10.3 Compliance with TIA. Every amendment or supplement to
this Indenture or the Securities shall be set forth in an amended
supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.

SECTION 10.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents.

(a) Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes
effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a continuing
consent by the Holder and every subsequent holder of a Security or
portion of a Security that evidences the same Indebtedness as the
consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not
made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder
may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security if
the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date on which
the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate certifying that the
Holders of the requisite principal amount of Securities

56
<PAGE> 65
have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the
amendment or waiver.

(b) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to,
fix a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of
Securities entitled to consent to any amendment or waiver. If a
record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the
immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were holders of
Securities at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and
only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment or
waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such
Persons continue to be holders of Securities after such record date.
No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after
such record date.

(c) After an amendment or waiver becomes effective it
shall bind every Holder, unless it is of the type described in Section
10.2(c), in which case the amendment or waiver shall only bind each
Holder that consented to it and every subsequent holder of a Security
that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.

SECTION 10.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities. The
Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or
waiver on any Security thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for
all Securities may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Securities that
reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate
notation or issue a new Security shall not affect the validity and effect of
such amendment, supplement or waiver.

SECTION 10.6 Trustee Protected. The Trustee shall sign any
amendment or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article Ten if
the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it.
In signing such amendment or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be
entitled to receive and, subject to Section 8.1, shall be fully protected in
relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as conclusive
evidence that such amendment or supplemental indenture is authorized or
permitted by this Indenture, that it is not inconsistent herewith, and that it
will be valid and binding upon the Company in accordance with its terms. The
Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until the Board of
Directors approves it.

under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for giving the

terms of an irrevocable trust agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee, as trust funds solely for the
benefit of the Holders for that purpose, money or U.S.
Government Obligations sufficient (in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the
Trustee), without consideration of any reinvestment of any
interest thereon, to pay principal and interest on the

payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance
with their terms, will provide, not later than one day before the due
date of any payment referred to in this clause (a), money in an amount
or (3) a combination thereof in an amount sufficient, in the opinion
of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee,
to pay and discharge, without consideration of the reinvestment of
such interest and after payment of all federal, state and local taxes
or other charges and assessments in respect thereof payable by the
Trustee, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
outstanding Securities at the Stated Maturity of such principal or

violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any
other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by
which either is bound;

(c) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee
(1) either (x) a ruling directed to the Trustee received from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Holders of Securities
will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under
this Section 11.1(B) and will be subject to federal income tax on the
same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such option had not been exercised or (y) an Opinion
of Counsel to the same effect as the ruling described in clause (x)
above and (2) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (w) the
creation of the defeasance trust does not violate the Investment
Company Act of 1940,

59
<PAGE> 68
(x) the Holders have a valid first-priority security interest in the
trust funds and (y) after the passage of 123 days following the
deposit (except, with respect to any trust funds for the account of
any Holder who may be deemed to be an "insider" for purposes of the
United States Bankruptcy Code, after one year following the deposit),
the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of Section 547 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code or Section 15 of the New York Debtor
and Creditor Law in a case commenced by or against the Company under
either such statute, and either (I) the trust funds will not longer
remain the property of the Company (and therefore will not be subject
to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally) or (II) if a
court were to rule under any such law in any case or proceeding that
the trust funds remained property of the Company, (a) assuming such
trust funds remained in the possession of the Trustee prior to such
court ruling to the extent not paid to the Holders, the Trustee will
hold, for the benefit of the Holders, a valid and perfected security
interest in such trust funds that is not avoidable in bankruptcy or
otherwise except for the effect of Section 552(b) of the United States
Bankruptcy Code on interest on the trust funds accruing after the
commencement of a case under such statute and (b) the Holders will be
entitled to receive adequate protection of their interests in such

(d) if the Securities are then listed on a national
securities exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such deposit, defeasance and
discharge will not cause the Securities to be delisted; and

(e) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case stating
that all conditions precedent provided for herein relating to the
defeasance contemplated by this Section 11.1(B) have been complied
with.

Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), prior to the end of the
123-day period referenced to in clause (d)(2)(y) above, none of the Company's
obligations under this Indenture shall be discharged. Subsequent to the end of
such 123-day period with respect to this Section 11.1, the Company's
obligations in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 8.6, 8.9,
11.2, 11.4 and 11.5 shall survive until the Securities are no longer
outstanding. Thereafter, only the Company's obligations in Section 8.6 and
11.2 shall survive. If and when a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or
an Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (d)(1) above is able to be provided
specifically without regard to, and not in reliance upon, the continuance of
the Company's obligations under Section 4.1, then the Company's obligations
under such Section 4.1 shall cease upon delivery to the Trustee of such ruling
or Opinion of Counsel and compliance with the other conditions precedent
provided for herein relating to the defeasance contemplated by this Section
11.1

After any such irrevocable deposit, the Trustee upon request, shall
acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's obligations under the
Securities and this Indenture

60
<PAGE> 69
with respect to the Securities except for those surviving obligations in the
immediately preceding paragraph.

(C) The Company may omit to comply with any term, provision 
or condition set forth in clause (d) of Section 6.1 of this Indenture, the 
covenants described in Sections 4.11, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15 and 4.18 of this 
Indenture and clause (c) of Section 7.1 of this Indenture with respect to such 
covenants, and clauses (d), (e) and (h) of Section 7.1 shall be deemed not to 
be Events of Default, in each case with respect to the outstanding Securities 
if:

(a) with reference to this Section 11.1(C), the Company has 
irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the 
Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 
8.8) and conveyed in and to all right, title and interest to the 
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders, under the terms of an 
irrevocable trust agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the 
Trustee as trust funds in trust, specifically pledged to the Trustee 
as security for payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and 
interest, if any, on the Securities for, and dedicated solely to, the 
benefit of the Holders of the Securities, in and to (1) money in an 
amount, (2) U.S. Government Obligations that, through the payment of 
interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their 
terms, will provide, not later than one day before the due date of 
any payment referred to in this clause (a), money in an amount or (3) 
a combination thereof in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a 
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed 
in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay 
and discharge, without consideration of the reinvestment of such 
interest and after payment of all federal, state and local taxes or 
other charges and assessments in respect thereof payable by the 
Trustee, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 
outstanding Securities on the Stated Maturity of such principal or
interest; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably 
instructed to apply such money or the proceeds of such U.S. 
Government Obligations to the payment of such principal, premium, if 
any, and interest with respect to the Securities;

(b) such deposit will not result in a breach or violation 
of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other 
agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound;

(c) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and 
be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(d) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of 
Counsel to the effect that (1) the creation of the defeasance trust 
does not violate the Investment Company Act of 1940, (2) the Holders 
of the Securities have a valid first-priority security interest in 
the trust funds, (3) the Holders will not recognize income, gain or 
loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and 
defeasance of certain obligations and will be subject to federal 
income tax on the same amount and

61
<PAGE> 70
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case
if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred and (4) after the
passage of 123 days following the deposit (except, with respect to any
trust funds for the account of any Holder who may be deemed to be an
"insider" for purposes of the United States Bankruptcy Code, after one
year following the deposit), the trust funds will not be subject to
the effect of Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
Section 15 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law in a case commenced
by or against the Company under either such statute, and either (x)
the trust funds will no longer remain the property of the Company (and
therefore will not be subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally) or (y) if a court were to rule under any
such law in any case or proceeding that the trust funds remained
property of the Company, and (i) assuming such trust funds remained in
the possession of the Trustee prior to such court ruling to the extent
not paid to the Holder,s the Trustee will hold, for the benefit of the
Holders, a valid and perfected security interest in such trustee funds
that is not avoidable in bankruptcy or otherwise except for the effect
of Section 552(b) of the United States Bankruptcy Code on interest on
the trust funds accruing after the commencement of a case under such
statute and (ii) the Holders will be entitled to receive adequate
protection of their interests in such trust funds if such trust funds
are used in such case or proceeding;

(e) if the Securities are then listed on a national
securities exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such deposit, defeasance and
discharge will not cause the Securities to be delisted; and

(f) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case stating
that all conditions precedent provided for herein relating to the
defeasance contemplated by this Section 11.1 have been complied with.

SECTION 11.2 Application by Trustee of Funds Deposited for
Payment of Securities; Other Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to Section
11.4, all monies deposited with the Trustee (or other trustee) pursuant to
Section 11.3 shall be held in trust and applied by it to the payment, either
directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company or the guarantor
acting as Paying Agent), to the Holders of the Securities for the payment or
redemption of which such monies have been deposited with the Trustee, of all
sums due and to become due thereon for principal premium, if any, and interest
if may; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the
extent required by law.

If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or
U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 11.1 by reason of any
legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
applications, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities
related thereto shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had
occurred pursuant to Section 11.1B(a) or 11.1C(a) until such time as the
Trustee or any Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S,
Government Obligations in accordance with Section 11.1; provided, however, that
if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of and premium
(if any) on the Securities because of the

62
<PAGE> 71
reinstatement of its obligations hereunder, the Company shall be subrogated to
the rights of the holders of the Securities to receive such payment from the
money or U.S. Government obligations held by the Trustee for such purpose.

SECTION 11.3 Repayment of Monies Held by Paying Agent. In
connection with the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect
to Securities, all monies then held by any Paying Agent under the provisions of
this Indenture with respect to such Securities shall, upon demand of the
Company, be repaid to the Company or paid to the Trustee and thereupon such
Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such
monies.

SECTION 11.4 Return of Monies Held by Trustee and Paying Agent
Unclaimed for Two Years. Any monies deposited with or paid to the Trustee or
any Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or
interest on any Security and not applied but remaining unclaimed for two years
after the date upon which such principal or interest shall have become due and
payable shall, upon the written request of the Company and unless otherwise
required by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or
unclaimed property law, be repaid to the Company by the Trustee or such Paying
Agent, and the Holder of the Securities shall, unless otherwise required by
mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property
laws, thereafter look only to the Company for any payment that such Holder may
be entitled to collect, and all liability of the Trustee or any Paying Agent
with respect to such monies shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment
with respect to monies deposited with it for any payment, may at the expense of
the Company, mail by first-class mail to Holders of such Securities at their
addresses as they shall appear on the security register notice, that such
monies remain and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less
than thirty days from the date of such mailing, any unclaimed balance of such
money then remaining will be, repaid to the Company.

SECTION 11.5 Indemnity for U.S. Government Obligations. The
Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other
charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited
by the Company pursuant to Section 11.1 or the principal or interest received
in respect of such obligations.

ARTICLE TWELVE - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

SECTION 12.1 Incorporators, Stockholders, Officers and
Directors of the Company Exempt from Individual Liability. No director,
officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or the Trustee
shall have any liability for any obligation of the Company under this Indenture
or the Securities or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
any such obligation or the creation of any such obligation. Each Holder by
accepting a Security waives and releases such Persons from all such liability

the Securities.

Parties and Holders of Securities. Nothing in this Indenture or in the
Securities expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any
person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their successors

thereto, at his last address an it appears in the Security register. In any

shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be
waived in writing by the person entitled to receive such notice, either before
or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but each filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in
reliance upon such waiver.

Statements to be Contained Therein. Upon any application or demand by the
Company to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this

shall accrue for the period after such date.

Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by, or with
another provision (an "incorporated provision") included in this Indenture by

1. Interest.

America West Airlines, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Security to
Persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on the relevant
Record Date at the rate of 11#% per annum.
Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months and shall be payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of
each year commencing March 1, 1995, or if any such day is not a Business Day,
on the next succeeding Business Day. Interest will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
date of issuance. Interest shall accrue with respect to principal of this
Security to, but not including, the date of repayment of such principal;
provided, however, that if payment to the Paying Agent occurs after 1:30 p.m.,
New York City time, interest shall be deemed to accrue until the following
Business Day.

To the extent lawful, the Company shall pay interest on overdue
principal, premium (if any) and interest at the rate of interest borne by this
Security. On each Interest Payment Date, interest on the Securities will be
paid for the immediately preceding accrual period.

2. Method of Payment.

The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted
interest) to the persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on
the Record Date next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date. If the
Company defaults in the payment of the interest due on such Interest Payment
Date, such defaulted interest will be paid to the Persons who are registered
Holders of Securities at the close of business on a subsequent record date
established by notice given not less than 15 days prior to such subsequent
record date. The Company will pay the principal of this Security to the Holder
that surrenders this Security to a Paying Agent on or after September 1, 2001
or, in the event of a redemption of this Security, on or after the Redemption
Date, as described below. The Company will pay principal and interest in U.S.
Legal Tender by Federal funds bank wire transfer or (in the case of payment of
interest) by check. If this Security is a Global Security, all payments in
respect of this Security will be made to the Depository or its nominee in
immediately available funds in accordance with customary procedures established
from time to time by the Depository.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar.

Initially, American Bank National Association (the "Trustee") will act
as Paying Agent and registrar for the Securities. The Company may change any
Paying Agent, co-Paying Agent, registrar or co-registrar without notice.
Except as provided in the Indenture, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
may, subject to certain exceptions, act as Paying Agent, registrar or
co-registrar.

4. Indenture.

The Company issued this Security under an Indenture dated as of August
25, 1994 (the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee. Capitalized
terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined
herein. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and
those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 (15 U.S. Code Sections 77aaa - 77bbbb). The Securities are subject to all
such terms, and Holders of the Securities are referred to the Indenture and
said Act for a statement of such terms. In the event of any conflict between
this Security and the Indenture, the Indenture shall govern. The Securities
are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited in aggregate principal
amount to $130,000,000.

5. Optional Redemption.

The Securities may be redeemed prior to September 1, 1997 (a) at any
time in whole but not in part, at a Redemption Price equal to 105% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding plus accrued and
unpaid interest hereon to the Redemption Date, or (b) from time to time in
part, excluding amounts redeemed pursuant to Section 3.8 of the Indenture, from
the Net Offering Proceeds received by the Company prior to September 1, 1997
from one or more Public Offering Sales at a Redemption Price equal to 105% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Securities so redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.

The Securities further may be redeemed on and after September 1, 1997,
at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a Redemption Price equal
to the applicable percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities so redeemed, set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to the Redemption Date.

If the Redemption Date is subsequent to a Record Date with respect to
any Interest Payment Date and on or prior to such Interest Payment Date, then
such accrued interest, if any, will be paid to the person in whose name such
Securities are registered at the close of business on such Record Date and no
other interest will be payable thereon.

6. Mandatory Redemption.

As more fully set forth in the Indenture, under certain circumstances
the Company is required to redeem Securities with the net proceeds from one or
more Public Offering Sales at a Redemption Price equal to 104% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Securities so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the Redemption Date.

7. Notice of Redemption.

Notice of Redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than
60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed
at his registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may
be redeemed in part, but not in denominations of less than $1,000.

From and after any Redemption Date, if monies for the redemption of
the Securities called for redemption shall have been made available for
redemption on such Redemption Date, the Securities called for redemption will
cease to bear interest and the only right of the Holders of such Securities
will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price.

8. Put Provisions.

As provided in and subject to the terms of the Indenture, upon a
Change of Control, any Holder will have the right to cause the Company to
repurchase all or any part of the Securities of such Holder at a repurchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Securities to be repurchased
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.

5
<PAGE> 82
9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.

The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may
register the transfer of or exchange Securities in accordance with the
Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees
required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company need not register
the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption. Also, the
Company need not issue, exchange or register the transfer of any Securities for
a period of 15 days prior to the selection of the Securities to be redeemed.

In accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and subject to
certain limitations therein set forth, an owner of a beneficial interest in a
Global Security may request a Security in certificated form, in exchange in
whole or in part, as the case may be, for such beneficial owner's interest in
the Global Security. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest
in a Global Security will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form
of Securities in authorized denominations equal in principal amount to such
beneficial interest and to have such Securities registered in its name.

10. Persons Deemed Owners.

The registered Holder of a Security may be treated as the owner of it
for all purposes.

With respect to Global Securities, the Depository shall grant proxies
and otherwise authorize Holders of Global Securities to give or take any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action which a Holder of a Security is entitled to give or take under the
Indenture.

11. Unclaimed Money.

If money deposited with or paid to the Trustee or any Paying Agent for
the payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest on the Securities
remains unclaimed for 2 years, the Trustee and any such Paying Agent will pay
the money back to the Company at its request. After that, all liability of the
Trustee and such Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease.

12. Discharge Prior to Redemption or Maturity.

If the Company at any time deposits with the Trustee money or U.S.
Government Obligations sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the
Securities to redemption or maturity and complies with the other provisions of
the Indenture relating thereto, the Company will be discharged from certain
provisions of the Indenture and the Securities (including the financial
covenants, but excluding certain obligations, including without limitation its
obligation to pay the principal of or interest on the Securities).

6
<PAGE> 83
13. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be
amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities and certain
existing Defaults or Events of Default or compliance with any provisions may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Securities. Without notice to or consent
of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture or the
Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement
any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision, or to make
any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the
Indenture which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Indenture
(provided such amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights of
any of the Holders), provide for any additional rights or benefits to Holders
or make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder.

14. Restrictive Covenants.

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, among other things, make payments in respect of its
Capital Stock or certain Indebtedness, merge or consolidate with any other
person or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of its properties or assets and undertake certain transactions with
Affiliates. The limitations are subject to a number of important
qualifications and exceptions. The Company must annually (and in certain
instances, more frequently) report to the Trustee on compliance with such
limitations.

15. Asset Sales.

As more fully set forth in the Indenture, the Indenture provides that
the Company must apply certain proceeds resulting from certain Asset Sales to
the repurchase of Securities under certain circumstances in an Excess Proceeds
Offer at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase. A Holder of
Securities may tender or refrain from tendering in any Excess Proceeds Offer
all or any portion of its Securities at its discretion by completing the form
entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" appearing on the reverse side of
this Security.

16. Successors.

When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under
the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those
obligations.

17. Defaults and Remedies.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, subject to certain
exceptions, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
Securities may declare all the

7
<PAGE> 84
Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Indenture. Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture
or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require
indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the
Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its
exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold notice in certain
circumstances.

18. Trustee Dealings with Company.

The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other
capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the
Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its
Affiliates as if it were not the Trustee.

19. No Recourse Against Others.

No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as such,
past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation shall have
any liability for any obligation of the Company under the Securities or the
Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder of a Security by accepting a
Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

20. Authentication.

This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or authenticating
agent signs the certificate of authentication on the face of this Security.

21. Abbreviation.

Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a
Security or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TENANT (=
tenants by the entireties), TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

22. Indenture.

of the terms and provisions of the Indenture applicable to such Holder.

The Company will furnish to any Holder of a Security upon written
request and without charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to:

form (the "Warrant Certificates") substantially in the form of Exhibit A
hereto, and designated as Warrants to Purchase Class B Common Stock of America

identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be
required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant
thereto or with any rule or regulation of any securities exchange, or to
conform to usage, or as may, consistently herewith, be determined to be
necessary or appropriate by the officers of the Company executing such Warrant
Certificates as evidenced by their execution of the Warrant Certificates. Each
Warrant shall evidence the right, subject to the provisions of this Agreement
and of the Warrant Certificate, to purchase one share of Class B Common Stock
at the Warrant Price, subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of
Article IV.

SECTION 2.02. Execution of Warrant Certificates. Each
Warrant Certificate, whenever issued, shall be dated as of the date of

Warrant Certificates may be countersigned by the Warrant Agent, with the same
effect, notwithstanding that any Persons whose manual or facsimile signatures

officers at the time of such countersignature. Any Warrant Certificate may be
signed on behalf of the Company by any Person who, at the actual date of the
execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company

Agreement any such Person was not such an officer.

SECTION 2.04. Transfer and Exchange of Warrant Certificates.

may be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred to any Person unless such
transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement or otherwise
in accordance with the requirements of the 1933 Act and applicable state
securities laws. Until the Restricted Securities (i) cease to be Restricted
Securities or (ii) have been registered and sold or otherwise disposed of under
the 1933 Act, certificates evidencing Restricted Securities (and only such
certificates) will bear a legend in substantially the following form:

THE ISSUANCE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"1933 ACT") OR PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE, AND SUCH
SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED OTHER THAN IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1933 ACT AND THE RULES AND
REGULATIONS THEREUNDER OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM AND FROM ANY
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Restricted
Securities" shall mean the Warrants issued to AmWest, GPA, Lehman Brothers Inc.
and "Fidelity," as such term is defined in and pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, dated as of August 25, 1994 among the Company, AmWest and the
other Holders named therein or any of their respective Affiliates or assignees
on the Distribution Date and (a) any shares of Class B Common Stock which have
been issued upon exercise of such Warrants and (b) any shares of Class B Common
Stock which are issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants. For the purposes
of this Agreement, such securities will cease to be Restricted Securities (i)
when they have been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the 1933 Act, (ii) when they are distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144
(or any similar provision then in force) under the 1933 Act or (iii) when (A)
they have been otherwise transferred without registration under the 1933 Act
pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act and
(B) if it has so requested, the Company has received an opinion of counsel
(either its own counsel or, if the Company so requests, counsel to the holders
of such Restricted Securities) acceptable to the Company that such Restricted
Securities may be so transferred without registration or pursuant to an
exemption, and in each such instance has delivered new certificates or other
evidence of ownership for such securities that are not subject to any stop
transfer order or other restriction on transfer and not bearing the legend
prescribed by the preceding paragraph.

(b) Subject to paragraph (a) above, the Warrant Agent, from
time to time, shall register the transfer of all or any whole number of
Warrants covered by any outstanding Warrant Certificates in the Warrant
Register upon surrender at the Warrant Agent's Office of Warrant Certificates
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent, duly executed by the
registered Warrant holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing. Upon any
such registration of transfer, a new Warrant Certificate shall be countersigned
by the Warrant Agent and issued to the transferee and the surrendered Warrant
Certificate shall promptly be canceled by the Warrant Agent. Warrant
Certificates may be exchanged at the option of the holder thereof, upon
surrender, properly endorsed by the Registered Holders with signature
guaranteed by a guarantor institution with membership in an approved signature
guarantee medallion program, at the Warrant Agent's Office, with written
instructions, for other Warrant Certificates countersigned by the Warrant Agent
representing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants. The Company or the
Warrant Agent may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such exchange or
transfer.

Warrants represented by a Warrant Certificate.

(b) Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) below and
Section 4.08 hereof, as soon as practicable (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the exercise of any Warrants and payment by the registered
Warrant holder of the full Warrant Price for the shares as to which such
Warrants are then being exercised, the Warrant Agent shall promptly requisition
from the transfer agent of the Class B Common Stock and deliver to or upon the
order of such registered Warrant holder a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Class B Common Stock to which such Warrant holder is
entitled, registered in such name or names as may be directed by him (if other
than to such registered holder, (i) to the extent such transfer is not validly
restricted and (ii) upon payment of any transfer taxes that are required to be
paid by such holder or its transferees in connection with any transfer by such
registered holder), together with cash or scrip, as provided in Section 3.03
hereof, in

8
<PAGE> 13
respect of any fractional shares, and, if the number of Warrants represented by
a Warrant Certificate shall not have been exercised in full, a new Warrant
Certificate delivered to the holder of the Warrant Certificate or to his duly
authorized assignee, countersigned by the Warrant Agent, for the number of
Warrants remaining unexercised, together with cash or scrip, as provided in
Section 4.04 hereof, in respect of the balance of any fractional Warrants
represented by the surrendered Warrant Certificate. Any shares of Class B
Common Stock issued upon a Warrant holder's exercise of any Warrant shall be
validly authorized and issued, fully paid, non-assessable, free of pre-emptive
rights and free from all taxes (other than those specified in clause (ii)
above), liens, charges, security interests and claims created or incurred by
the Company in respect of the issuance thereof.

(c) A Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised
immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the due surrender for
exercise of the Warrant Certificate and payment to the Warrant Agent for the
account of the Company of the Warrant Price and any applicable taxes that the
Company is not required to pay as set forth in Section 4.08 or 6.01. Each
Person in whose name any such certificate for shares of Class B Common Stock is
issued shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of
such shares at the close of business on the date on which the Warrant
Certificate was duly surrendered to the Warrant Agent and payment of the
Warrant Price and any such applicable taxes was made to the Warrant Agent for
the account of the Company, irrespective of the date of delivery of such share
certificate, except that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date
when the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be
deemed to have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the
next succeeding date on which the stock transfer books are open (whether before
or after the Expiration Date).

(d) The Warrant Agent shall promptly notify both the
Company and the transfer agent of the Class B Common Stock in writing of any
exercise of any Warrant and of the number of shares delivered upon the exercise
of such Warrant and shall pay to the Company within 72 hours after receipt by
wire transfer or certified or official bank check payable to the order of the
Company the amount of money received by it upon the exercise of Warrants (less
any amount paid by the Warrant Agent in respect of a fractional share upon such
exercise in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof). The Warrant Agent shall hold
any proceeds collected and not yet paid to the Company in a federally insured
escrow account. A detailed accounting statement setting forth the number of
Warrants exercised, the amount of funds received upon such exercise and all
expenses incurred by the Warrant Agent as provided in this Agreement shall be
transmitted to the Company on payment to the Company of the funds so received
upon exercise.

9
<PAGE> 14
The Warrant Agent shall render to the Company a complete accounting setting
forth the number of Warrants exercised, the identity of the Persons exercising
such Warrants, the number of shares issued, the amounts distributed to the
Company and all expenses incurred by the Warrant Agent as provided in this
Agreement as of the Expiration Date.

(e) The Warrant Agent may deem and treat the Person named
as the registered holder on the face of any Warrant as the true and lawful
owner thereof for all purposes. If the Warrant Agent is instructed to deliver
shares upon the exercise of Warrants or to deliver a Warrant Certificate
representing unexercised Warrants, in either case registered in a name or names
other than the name or names in which a Warrant Certificate tendered in
connection with such exercise is registered, the Warrant Agent may require such
documents, and such evidence of payment of applicable transfer taxes, as it may
deem necessary to enable it to carry out the instructions of the bearer.

SECTION 3.03. No Fractional Shares to Be Issued.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
number of shares of Class B Common Stock purchasable on the exercise of each
Warrant is adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.02 hereof, the
Company shall not be required to issue any fraction of a share of Class B
Common Stock or to distribute stock certificates that evidence fractional
shares of Class B Common Stock. If Warrant Certificates evidencing more than
one Warrant shall be surrendered for exercise at one time by the same holder,
the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon exercise thereof shall
be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Warrants so surrendered.
If any fraction of a share of Class B Common Stock would, except for the
provisions of this Section 3.03, be issuable on the exercise of any Warrant or
Warrants, the Company shall, at its option upon notice to the Warrant Agent
given within two (2) Business Days of exercise of any such Warrant or Warrants,
either (a) purchase such fraction for an amount in cash equal to the
then-current market value of such fraction computed in accordance with Section
4.01(d) hereof (assuming, for the purpose of such computation, that the date of
surrender of such Warrants to the Warrant Agent shall be the applicable record
date referred to in Section 4.01(d)) or (b) issue scrip of the Company in lieu
thereof, rounded up to the nearest one-hundredth of a share. Such scrip shall
be non-dividend bearing and non-voting, shall be exchangeable in combination
with other similar scrip for the number of full shares of Class B Common Stock
represented thereby, shall be issued in such denominations (not less than
one-hundredth of a share) and in such form, shall expire after such reasonable
time (which shall not be sooner than either (i) five years from the date of
issue or (ii) one year after the Expiration Date, whichever first occurs) and
may contain such provisions for sale

10
<PAGE> 15
for the account of the holders of such scrip of shares of Class B Common Stock
for which such scrip is exchangeable or the payment to such holders of the
market value of such shares, and be subject to such other terms and provisions,
if any, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. The Warrant
holders, by their acceptance of the Warrant Certificates, expressly waive their
right to receive any fraction of a share of Class B Common Stock or a stock
certificate representing a fraction of a share of Class B Common Stock.

SECTION 3.04. Acquisition of Warrants by the Company;
Cancellation of Warrants. The Company shall have the right, except as limited
by law or other agreement, to purchase or otherwise acquire Warrants at such
times, in such manner and for such consideration as it may deem appropriate.
The Warrant Agent shall cancel any Warrant Certificate delivered to it for
exercise, in whole or in part, or delivered to it for transfer, exchange, or
substitution, and no Warrant Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof
unless such exercise, transfer, exchange or substitution is expressly permitted
by the provisions of this Agreement. On request of the Company, the Warrant
Agent shall destroy canceled Warrant Certificates held by it and shall deliver
its certificates of destruction to the Company. If the Company shall acquire
any of the Warrants, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or
termination of the right represented by such Warrants unless and until the
Warrant Certificates evidencing such Warrants are surrendered to the Warrant
Agent for cancellation.

SECTION 3.05. Notice to Holders of Bankruptcy Court Action
with regard to Warrant Price.

(a) In the event that a Warrant Price of $12.74 for each
share of Class B Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a Warrant has not been
confirmed by a Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court as of September 7, 1994, the
Company shall promptly file with the Warrant Agent an Officers' Certificate
setting forth such fact, and promptly after such filing shall mail or cause to
be mailed a notice of such fact to each Warrant holder at his last address as
the same appears on the Warrant Register. The Warrant Agent shall be under no
duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit
the same to any holder of Warrants desiring inspection thereof.

(b) In the event that a Warrant Price for each share of
Class B Common Stock issuable upon exercise of a Warrant is subsequently
confirmed by a Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court on or after September 7,
1994, the Company shall promptly file with the Warrant Agent an Officers'
Certificate setting forth (A) the Warrant Price so confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court and (B) the date of such final order of the Bankruptcy Court, and
promptly after such filing shall mail or cause to be mailed a

11
<PAGE> 16
notice of such Warrant Price and date of such final order to each Warrant
holder at his last address as the same appears on the Warrant Register. The
Warrant Agent shall be under no duty or responsibility with respect to any such
certificate except to exhibit the same to any holder of Warrants desiring
inspection thereof.

ARTICLE IV

ADJUSTMENT OF WARRANT PRICE, SHARES OF COMMON
STOCK PURCHASABLE AND NUMBER OF WARRANTS

SECTION 4.01. Adjustment of Warrant Price. The Warrant Price
specified in Section 3.01 shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

(a) If the Company after the date hereof shall (i) pay a
dividend or make a distribution to all holders of Common Stock or any class
thereof in shares of Common Stock or any class thereof, (ii) subdivide the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or any class thereof, or (iii) combine the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or any class thereof into a smaller number
of shares, then in any such case the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior
thereto shall be adjusted to a price obtained by multiplying such Warrant Price
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding prior to such action and the denominator shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding after giving effect to such action. An
adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this subsection (a) shall become
effective retroactively immediately after the record date for such dividend or
distribution, and an adjustment made pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this
subsection (a) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of
such subdivision or combination.

(b) If the Company after the date hereof shall issue rights
or warrants to all holders of Common Stock or any class thereof entitling them
for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date mentioned below to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or any class thereof at a
price per share less than the then-current market price per share (as
determined pursuant to subsection (d) below) on the record date (or, if
applicable, the ex-distribution date) mentioned below, the Warrant Price in
effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted to a price obtained by
multiplying such Warrant Price by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall
be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of
such rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock of the class
subject to such rights or warrants which the aggregate offering price of the
total number of shares so to be offered would purchase at the current market
price of the Common

12
<PAGE> 17
Stock subject to such rights or warrants, and (ii) the denominator shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such
rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock, or the
applicable class thereof, to be offered for subscription or purchase; provided,
however, that no adjustment shall be made if the Company issues or distributes
to each holder of Warrants the rights or warrants which each holder of Warrants
would have been entitled to receive had such Warrants been exercised prior to
the record date mentioned below. Any such adjustments shall be made whenever
such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective retroactively
immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such rights or warrants. Upon expiration of the period
during which any such rights or warrants may be exercised, any adjustment
previously made pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall be recalculated to
take into consideration only those rights or warrants actually exercised during
the applicable period for exercise and notice of any such further adjustment to
the Warrant Price shall be given to Warrant holders as herein provided.

(c) If the Company after the date hereof shall issue or
distribute to all holders of Common Stock or any class thereof evidences of its
indebtedness or assets (excluding any cash dividend or distribution), shares of
capital stock of any class (other than the Common Stock) or rights to subscribe
therefor (excluding those referred to in subsection (b) above), in each such
case the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted to
a price obtained by multiplying such Warrant Price by a fraction of which (i)
the numerator shall be the sum of the amount, for each class of Common Stock
then outstanding, of the then-current market price per share (determined as
provided in subsection (d) below) of the Common Stock of such class, multiplied
by the number of outstanding shares of such class, in each case on the record
date (or, if applicable, the ex-distribution date) mentioned below less the
then-current fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in its
reasonable judgement whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in
a statement filed with the Warrant Agent) of the assets or evidences of
indebtedness so distributed, or shares of capital stock of any class other than
Common Stock or rights to subscribe therefor so issued, and (ii) the
denominator shall be the sum of the amount, for each class of Common Stock then
outstanding, of the then-current market price per share of the Common Stock of
such class, multiplied by the number of outstanding shares of such class, in
each case on the record date (or, if applicable, the ex-distribution date)
mentioned below; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made (1) if the
Company issues or distributes to each holder of Warrants the subscription
rights referred to above in this subsection (c) that each holder of Warrants
would have been entitled to receive had the Warrants been exercised prior to
the record date mentioned

13
<PAGE> 18
below, or (2) if the Company grants to each holder of Warrants the right to
receive, upon the exercise thereof at any time after the distribution of the
evidences of indebtedness or assets or shares of capital stock of any class
other than the Common Stock referred to above in this subsection (c), the
evidences of indebtedness or assets or shares of capital stock of any class
other than the Common Stock that such holder would have been entitled to
receive had the Warrants been exercised prior to the record date mentioned
below. The Company shall provide the Warrant Agent, upon receipt of a written
request therefor, with any indenture or other instrument defining the rights of
the holders of any indebtedness, assets, capital stock or subscription rights
referred to in this subsection 4.01(c). Any such adjustment shall be made
whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective retroactively
immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such distribution. Upon expiration of the period during
which any subscription rights granted pursuant to this subsection (c) may be
exercised, any adjustment previously made pursuant to the foregoing provisions
shall be recalculated to take into consideration only those subscription rights
actually exercised during the applicable period for exercise and notice of any
such further adjustment to the Warrant Price shall be given to Warrant holders
as herein provided.

(d) For the purpose of any computation under subsection (b)
or (c) above, the current market price per share of any class of Common Stock
on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily mean between the
high and low sales prices regular way of the shares of such class of Common
Stock on the exchange on which such shares are listed as specified below for
the ten consecutive trading days (as defined below) preceding the applicable
record date (or, if earlier, the date on which such class of Common Stock
commences trading on an ex- distribution basis). If there shall not have been a
sale regular way on any such trading day, the mean of the last reported bid and
asked quotations regular way on the specified exchange on such day shall be
deemed to be the only sale price. The exchange specified for purposes of this
subsection 4.01(d) shall be the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. if the shares of
the applicable class of Common Stock are listed thereon or, if the shares of
the applicable class of Common Stock shall not be listed on such exchange, then
that national securities exchange on which the applicable class of Common Stock
is listed having the largest volume of trading in the applicable class of
Common Stock during the calendar year or portion thereof next preceding such
computation. If the shares of the applicable class of Common Stock shall not
be listed on any such exchange on all such ten trading days, the average of the
closing high bid and low asked prices for the applicable class of Common Stock
in the over-the-counter market on each trading day on which such shares are not
so listed as reported by the National Association of Securities

14
<PAGE> 19
Dealers Automatic Quotation System or, if not so reported, then as reported by
the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or if such organization is not in
existence, by an organization providing similar services (as determined by the
Board of Directors of the Company), shall be deemed to be the only sale price
on such trading day. If the shares of the applicable class of Common Stock
shall not be so reported on any of such trading days, then the current market
price per share of such shares of Common Stock shall be the fair market value
thereof as determined in the reasonable judgement of the Board of Directors.
For the purpose of this subsection 4.01(d), "trading day" shall mean a day on
which the securities exchange specified for purposes of this subsection 4.01(d)
shall be open for business or, if the shares of the applicable class of Common
Stock shall not be listed on such exchange for such period, a day with respect
to which quotations of the character specified for purposes of this subsection
4.01(d) shall be reported.

(e) In any case in which this Section 4.01 shall require that
an adjustment be made retroactively immediately following a record date, the
Company may elect to defer (but only until five Business Days following the
filing by the Company with the Warrant Agent of a certificate signed by the
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice
President of the Company (an "Officers' Certificate") as required in subsection
(g) of this Section 4.01) issuing to the holder of any Warrant exercised after
such record date the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such exercise
in excess of the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such exercise
prior to such adjustment.

(f) No adjustment shall be required unless such adjustment
would require an increase or decrease of at least $.05 in the Warrant Price
then subject to adjustment; provided, however, that any adjustments that are
not made by reason of this subsection (f) shall be carried forward and taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment. In case the Company shall at any
time issue Common Stock or any class thereof by way of dividend on any stock of
the Company or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock or
any class thereof, said amount of $.05 specified in the preceding sentence (as
theretofore increased or decreased, if said amount shall have been adjusted in
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (f)) shall forthwith be
proportionately increased in the case of such a combination or decreased in the
case of such a subdivision or stock dividend so as appropriately to reflect the
same. All calculations under this Section 4.01 shall be made to the nearest
hundredth of a cent.

(g) Whenever an adjustment in the Warrant Price is made as
required or permitted by the provisions of Section 4.01, 4.02 or 4.03 of this
Agreement, the Company shall promptly file with the Warrant Agent an Officers'
Certificate (A) setting forth

15
<PAGE> 20
the adjusted Warrant Price as provided in this Section 4.01 and setting forth a
brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and the computation
thereof, and (B) setting forth the number of shares of Class B Common Stock (or
portions thereof) purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant after such adjustment
in the Warrant Price in accordance with Section 4.02 hereof or the number of
Warrants outstanding in accordance with Section 4.03 hereof after such
adjustment in the Warrant Price and the record date therefor, and promptly
after such filing shall mail or cause to be mailed a notice of such adjustment
to each Warrant holder at his last address as the same appears on the Warrant
Register. The Warrant Agent shall be under no duty or responsibility with
respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any holder of
Warrants desiring inspection thereof.

(h) In case:

(1) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other
distribution) on shares of Common Stock or any class thereof payable
from sources other than its retained earnings (as such term is used in
generally accepted accounting principles); or

(2) the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders
of shares of Common Stock or any class thereof of rights to subscribe
for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any
other right; or

(3) of any reclassification of shares of Common Stock or any
class thereof (other than a subdivision or combination of outstanding
shares of Common Stock or any class thereof), or of any consolidation
or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of
any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or

(4) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the Company;

then the Company shall cause to be filed with the Warrant Agent, and shall
cause to be mailed to the holders of the Warrants, at their last addresses as
they shall appear upon the Warrant Register, at least 10 days prior to the
applicable record date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on
which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
rights, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of
Common Stock (or any class thereof) of record to be entitled to such dividend,
distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up is expected to become

16
<PAGE> 21
effective, and, if applicable, the date as of which it is expected that holders
of Common Stock (or any class thereof) of record shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property (including cash)
deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give any such notice, or any
defect therein, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings referred to in
clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 4.01, the Company shall be entitled, but not required, to make
such reductions in the Warrant Price, in addition to those required by this
Section 4.01, as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable,
including, without limitation, in order that any dividend in or distribution of
shares of Common Stock (or any class thereof) or shares of capital stock of any
class other than Common Stock, subdivision, reclassification or combination of
shares of Common Stock, issuance of rights or warrants, or any other
transaction having a similar effect, shall not be treated as a distribution of
property by the Company to its stockholders under Section 305 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or any successor provision and shall not be
taxable to them.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no adjustment to the Warrant Price or the number of shares of
Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant (or the number of Warrants)
shall be made as a result of, or in connection with (i) the issuance of options
or rights to purchase Common Stock issued to directors, officers or employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to a stock option or other similar
plan adopted by the Board of Directors, or the modification, renewal or
extension of any such plan if approved by the Board of Directors, (ii) the
issuance of shares of Common Stock or other securities issued by the Company
pursuant to and in accordance with the Plan, the Investment Agreement or the
Related Agreements, or (iii) the conversion of shares of any class of Common
Stock into shares of any other class of Common Stock pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company as in effect from time to time.

SECTION 4.02. Adjustment of Shares of Class B Common Stock
Purchasable Upon Exercise of Warrants. Unless the Company shall have exercised
its election as provided in Section 4.03 hereof, upon each adjustment of the
Warrant Price pursuant to Section 4.01 hereof the number of shares of Class B
Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant outstanding prior to the
effectiveness of such adjustment shall be adjusted to the number of shares of
Class B Common Stock, calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a share,
obtained by (i) multiplying the number of

17
<PAGE> 22
shares of Class B Common Stock purchasable immediately prior to such adjustment
upon the exercise of a Warrant by the Warrant Price in effect prior to such
adjustment, and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Warrant Price in
effect after such adjustment of the Warrant Price.

SECTION 4.03. Election to Adjust Warrants Instead of Shares
Per Warrant. The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of
the Warrant Price pursuant to Section 4.01 hereof to adjust the number of
Warrants outstanding in substitution for any adjustment in the number of shares
of Class B Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Warrant as provided
in Section 4.02 hereof. Each of the Warrants outstanding after such adjustment
of the number of Warrants shall be exercisable for one share of Class B Common
Stock. Each Warrant held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of
Warrants shall become that number of Warrants (calculated to the nearest
hundredth) obtained by (i) multiplying the number of Warrants held of record
prior to adjustment of the number of Warrants by the Warrant Price in effect
prior to adjustment of the Warrant Price, and (ii) dividing the product so
obtained by the Warrant Price in effect after adjustment of the Warrant Price.
The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the
number of Warrants, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if
known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date
may be the date on which the Warrant Price is adjusted or any day thereafter,
but shall not be less than 10 or more than 30 days later than the date of
public announcement. Upon each adjustment of the number of Warrants pursuant to
this Section 4.03, the Company shall cause the Warrant Agent, as promptly as
practicable, to distribute to holders of record of the Warrant Certificates on
such record date either (i) Warrant Certificates evidencing any additional
Warrants to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such
adjustment, or (ii) in substitution and replacement for the Warrant
Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon
surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Warrant Certificates
evidencing all the Warrants to which such holders shall be entitled after such
adjustment. Warrant Certificates to be so distributed shall be issued, executed
and countersigned in the manner specified in this Agreement (but may bear, at
the option of the Company, the adjusted Warrant Price), shall represent the
same class of Warrants as was represented by the Warrant Certificates so
surrendered and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of
the Warrant Certificates on the record date specified in the public
announcement.

For the purposes of this Section 4.03, "public announcement"
shall mean publication at least once in a newspaper printed in the English
language and customarily published at least once a day for at least five days
in each calendar week and

18
<PAGE> 23
of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York.

SECTION 4.04. No Fractional Warrants to Be Issued.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Warrants on any
distribution of Warrants to Warrant holders pursuant to Section 4.03 hereof or
otherwise or to distribute Warrant Certificates that evidence fractional
Warrants. If any fraction of a Warrant would, except for the provisions of
this Section 4.04, be issuable upon an adjustment of the Warrant Price and
distribution of Warrants pursuant to Section 4.03 hereof or otherwise, the
Company shall, at its option, either (a) purchase such fraction for an amount
in cash equal to the then-current market value of such fraction computed in
accordance with Section 4.01(d) hereof (with respect to the current market
price of the Warrant rather than the per share current market price of the
Class B Common Stock and assuming, for the purpose of such computation, that
the effective date of such adjustment of the Warrant Price, or such other
relevant date, shall be the applicable record date referred to in Section
4.01(d)) or (b) issue scrip of the Company in lieu thereof, rounded up to the
nearest one-hundredth of a Warrant. Such scrip shall be exchangeable in
combination with other similar scrip for the number of full Warrants
represented thereby, shall be issued in such denominations (not less than
one-hundredth of a Warrant) and in such form, shall expire on the Expiration
Date and may contain such provisions for sale for the account of the holders of
such scrip of the Warrants for which such scrip is exchangeable or the payment
to such holders of the market value of such Warrants, and be subject to such
other terms and provisions, if any, as the Board of Directors may from time to
time determine. The Warrant holders, by their acceptance of the Warrant
Certificates, expressly waive their right to receive any fraction of a Warrant
or a Warrant Certificate representing a fraction of a Warrant upon the
adjustment thereof in accordance with this Article IV or otherwise.

SECTION 4.05. Rights Upon Consolidation, Merger, Sale,
Transfer or Reclassification.

(a) In case of any consolidation with or merger of the
Company into another corporation (other than a merger or consolidation in which
the Company is the continuing corporation), or in case of any lease, sale or
conveyance to another corporation of the property of the Company as an entirety
or substantially as an entirety, such successor, leasing or purchasing
corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Warrant Agent a
supplemental agreement (1) providing that the holder of each Warrant then
outstanding shall have the right thereafter (until the Expiration Date) to
receive, upon exercise thereof, in lieu of each share of Class B Common Stock

19
<PAGE> 24
deliverable upon such exercise immediately prior to such event, only the kind
and amount of shares and/or other securities and/or property and/or cash
receivable upon such consolidation, merger, lease, sale or conveyance by a
holder of one share of Class B Common Stock, and (2) setting forth the Warrant
Price for the shares and/or other securities and/or property and/or cash so
issuable, which shall be an amount equal to the Warrant Price per share of
Class B Common Stock immediately prior to such event.

(b) In case of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the affairs of the Company, the Company shall make prompt, proportionate,
equitable, lawful and adequate provision as part of the terms of such
dissolution, liquidation or winding up such that the holder of a Warrant may
thereafter receive, on exercise of such Warrant, in lieu of each share of Class
B Common Stock of the Company which such holder would have been entitled to
receive upon exercise of such Warrant, the same kind and amount of any stock,
securities or assets as may be issuable, distributable or payable on any such
dissolution, liquidation or winding up with respect to each share of Class B
Common Stock of the Company; provided, however, that in the event of any such
dissolution, liquidation or winding up, the right to exercise the Warrants
shall terminate on a date fixed by the Company, such date to be not earlier
than the 60th day next succeeding the date on which notice of such termination
of the right to exercise the Warrants has been given by mail to the holders
thereof in accordance with Section 4.01(h).

(c) In case of any reclassification or change of the shares
of Class B Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (other than a
change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or as a result of a
subdivision or combination) or in case of any consolidation or merger of
another corporation into the Company in which the Company is the continuing
corporation and in which the holders of the shares of Common Stock thereafter
receive shares and/or other securities and/or property and/or cash for such
shares of Common Stock (including for this purpose shares reflecting a change
in par value or from par value to no par value or as a result of a subdivision
or combination of the shares of Common Stock), the Company shall execute with
the Warrant Agent a supplemental agreement (1) providing that the holder of
each Warrant then outstanding shall have the right thereafter (until the
Expiration Date) to receive, upon exercise thereof, in lieu of each share of
Class B Common Stock, deliverable upon such exercise immediately prior to such
event, only the kind and amount of shares and/or other securities and/or
property and/or cash receivable upon such reclassification, change,
consolidation or merger by a holder of one share of Class B Common Stock, and
(2) setting forth the Warrant Price for the shares and/or other securities
and/or property and/or cash so issuable, which shall be an amount equal to the
Warrant Price per share of Class B Common Stock

20
<PAGE> 25
immediately prior to such event. If, as a result of this subsection (c), the
holder of any Warrant thereafter surrendered for exercise shall become entitled
to receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the Company, the
Board of Directors (whose determination shall be conclusive and shall be
described in a statement filed with the Warrant Agent) shall determine the
allocation of the Warrant Price between or among shares of such classes of
capital stock.

(d) Any supplemental agreement entered into pursuant to this
Section 4.05 shall, where appropriate, state the Warrant Price in terms of one
full share of Class B Common Stock of the Company or one full share of the
common stock of any successor, leasing or purchasing corporation.

(e) The above provisions of this Section 4.05 shall similarly
apply to successive reclassifications and changes of shares of Class B Common
Stock and to successive consolidations, mergers, leases, sales or conveyances,
mutatis mutandis.

(f) Notice of the execution of any such supplemental
agreement shall be mailed by the Company to registered holders of Warrants as
soon as practicable after the execution of such supplemental agreement.

(g) In the event that at any time as a result of the
provisions of this Section 4.05, the holder of any Warrant thereafter
surrendered for exercise shall become entitled to receive any shares or other
securities other than shares of Class B Common Stock, thereafter the price or
prices of such other shares or other securities so receivable upon exercise of
any Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on
terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions of Article IV with
respect to Class B Common Stock, and the provisions of Article III with respect
to the Class B Common Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares
or other securities.

SECTION 4.06. Covenant to Reserve Shares for Issuance on
Exercise. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep
available free of preemptive rights out of its authorized and unissued Class B
Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issue upon exercise of Warrants and
exchange of scrip as herein provided, the full number of shares of Class B
Common Stock, if any, then issuable if all outstanding Warrants then
exercisable were to be exercised. The Company covenants that all shares of
Class B Common Stock which shall be so issuable shall be duly and validly
issued and fully paid and non-assessable.

The Company hereby authorizes and directs its current and
future transfer agents for the Class B Common Stock and for any shares of the
Company's capital stock issuable upon the

21
<PAGE> 26
exercise of any of the Warrants at all times to reserve such number of
authorized shares as shall be requisite for such purpose. The Warrant Agent is
hereby authorized to requisition from time to time from any such transfer
agents stock certificates required to honor outstanding Warrants upon exercise
thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Company hereby
authorizes and directs such transfer agents to comply with all such requests of
the Warrant Agent. The Company will supply such transfer agents with duly
executed stock certificates for such purposes and will provide or otherwise
make available any cash or scrip which may be payable as provided in this
Article IV. Promptly after the Expiration Date, the Warrant Agent shall
certify to the Company the aggregate number of Warrants then outstanding, and
thereafter no shares shall be reserved in respect of such Warrants.

SECTION 4.07. Condition Precedent to Reduction of Warrant
Price Below Par Value of Shares of Class B Common Stock; Compliance with
Governmental Requirements; Suspension of Exercise of Warrants. Before taking
any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Warrant Price to below
the then par value of any of the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants, the Company will take any corporate action that may,
in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may
validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of such Class B
Common Stock at such adjusted Warrant Price.

The Company covenants that if any shares of Class B Common
Stock required to be reserved for purposes of exercise of Warrants or exchange
of scrip require, under any Federal or state law or rule or regulation of any
national securities exchange, registration with or approval of any governmental
authority, or listing on any national securities exchange before such shares
may be issued upon exercise, the Company will in good faith and as
expeditiously as possible endeavor to cause such shares to be duly registered,
approved or listed on the relevant national securities exchange, as the case
may be; provided, however, that in no event shall such shares of Class B Common
Stock be issued, and the Company is hereby authorized to suspend the exercise
of all Warrants, for the period during which such registration, approval or
listing is required but not in effect.

SECTION 4.08. Payment of Taxes on Stock Certificates Issued
upon Exercise. The initial issuance of certificates of Class B Common Stock
upon the exercise of Warrants shall be made without charge to the exercising
Warrant holders for any transfer, stamp or similar tax or for any other
governmental charges that may be imposed in respect of the issuance of such
stock certificates, and such stock certificates shall be issued in the
respective names of, or in such names as may be directed by, the registered
holders of the Warrants exercised; provided,

22
<PAGE> 27
however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or such other
charges that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of any such stock certificate, any Warrant Certificates or other
securities in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Warrant
Certificate surrendered upon exercise of the Warrant, and the Company shall not
be required to issue or deliver such certificates or other securities unless
and until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid
to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

SECTION 4.09. Warrant Agent Not Responsible for Adjustments
or Validity of Stock. The Warrant Agent shall not at any time be under any
duty or responsibility to any Warrant holder to determine whether any facts
exist that may require an adjustment of the Warrant Price, or with respect to
the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the
method employed herein or in any supplemental agreement in making the same.
The Warrant Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or
value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Class B Common Stock or of any
securities or property or scrip which may at any time be issued or delivered
upon the exercise of any Warrant or upon any adjustment pursuant to this
Article IV, and it makes no representation with respect thereto. The Warrant
Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash
payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Class B Common Stock or
stock certificates or other securities or property upon the surrender of any
Warrant for the purpose of exercise or upon any adjustment pursuant to this
Article IV, or to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in
this Article IV.

SECTION 4.10. Statements on Warrants. The form of Warrant
Certificate need not be changed because of any adjustment made pursuant to this
Article IV, and Warrant Certificates issued after such adjustment may state the
same Warrant Price and the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock as are
stated in the Warrant Certificates initially issued pursuant to this Agreement.
The Company, however, may at any time in its sole discretion (which shall be
conclusive) make any change in the form of Warrant Certificate that it may deem
appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof; and any Warrant
Certificate thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or
substitution for an outstanding Warrant Certificate or otherwise, may be in the
form as so changed.

ARTICLE V

OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF WARRANTS

SECTION 5.01. No Rights as Stockholders. Nothing contained
in this Agreement or in any Warrant Certificate shall be construed as
conferring on the holder of any Warrant or its transferee any rights whatsoever
as a stockholder of the Company, either at law or equity, including but not
limited to the right to vote at, or to receive notice of, any meeting of
stockholders of the Company; nor shall the consent of any such holder be
required with respect to any action or proceeding of the Company; nor shall any
such holder, by reason of the ownership or possession of a Warrant or the
Warrant Certificate representing the same, either at, before or after
exercising such Warrant, have any right to receive any cash dividends, stock
dividends, allotments or rights, or other distributions (except as specifically
provided herein), paid, allotted or distributed or distributable to the
stockholders of the Company prior to the date of the exercise of such Warrant,
nor shall such holder have any right not expressly conferred by this Agreement
or the Warrant Certificate that he holds.

SECTION 5.02. Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates. If
any Warrant Certificate is lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Company
shall issue and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, in exchange and
substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant Certificate, or
in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon receipt of a proper affidavit or other evidence satisfactory to
the Company and the Warrant Agent (and surrender of any mutilated Warrant
Certificate) and bond of indemnity in form and amount and with corporate surety
satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent in each instance protecting
the Company and the Warrant Agent, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and
representing an equivalent number of Warrants as the Warrant Certificate so
lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed. Any such new Warrant Certificate shall
constitute an original contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not
the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Warrant Certificate shall be
at any time enforceable by anyone. An applicant for such a substitute Warrant
Certificate shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and pay
such other reasonable charges as the Company or the Warrant Agent may
prescribe. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed Warrant Certificate is held by a Person to which Warrant
Certificates were originally issued pursuant to Section 2.03(a) or 2.03(c), an
indemnity agreement from such Person in lieu of a bond shall be acceptable and
no charges other than the reasonable expenses of the Company in effecting such
substitution shall be made for such substitution. All Warrant Certificates
shall be held and owned upon the express

24
<PAGE> 29
condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive, with respect to the
replacement of lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Warrant Certificates, and
shall, to the full extent permitted by law, preclude any and all other rights
or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to
the contrary with respect to the replacement of negotiable instruments or other
securities without their surrender.

SECTION 5.03. Delivery of Prospectuses. If, and to the
extent that, the Company may be required by the 1933 Act or any other
applicable Federal or state law to furnish a prospectus to Warrant holders upon
their exercise of Warrants, the Company shall cause to be kept, either at the
Warrant Agent's Office or at such other location designated by the Company,
sufficient quantities of such prospectuses for delivery to Warrant holders upon
their exercise of Warrants, and shall deliver such prospectuses or cause such
prospectuses to be delivered to such Warrant holders together with the shares
of Class B Common Stock or other securities receivable by such Warrant holders
upon their exercise of Warrants.

ARTICLE VI

CONCERNING THE WARRANT AGENT

SECTION 6.01. Payment of Certain Taxes. The Company will
from time to time promptly pay all transfer, stamp or similar taxes and all
other governmental charges that may be imposed upon the Company or otherwise in
respect of the initial issuance or delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock
upon the exercise of Warrants, but the Company shall not be obligated to pay
any transfer, stamp or similar taxes or other governmental charges in respect
of any transfer of the Warrants or such shares effected by any holder thereof.

SECTION 6.02. Change of Warrant Agent.

(a) The Warrant Agent, or any successor to it hereafter
appointed, may resign its duties and be discharged from all further duties and
liabilities hereunder (except liabilities arising as a result of the Warrant
Agent's own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith) after giving 60 days'
notice in writing to the Company, except that such shorter notice may be given
as the Company and AmWest shall, in writing, accept as sufficient. At least 15
days prior to the date such resignation is to become effective, the Warrant
Agent shall cause a copy of such notice of resignation to be mailed to the
registered holder of each Warrant Certificate. If the office of the Warrant
Agent becomes vacant by resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the
Company shall appoint a successor Warrant Agent in place of the Warrant Agent ;
provided that in the event that AmWest is the holder of any Warrants at such
time, the Company shall notify and

25
<PAGE> 30
consult with AmWest with respect to such proposed appointment. If the Company
shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 60 days after it has
been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or
incapacitated Warrant Agent or by any holder of Warrants (who shall, with such
notice, submit a copy of his Warrant Certificate for inspection by the
Company), then the holder of any Warrants may apply, at the expense of the
Company, to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor warrant agent.

(b) The Warrant Agent may be removed by the Company at
any time upon 30 days' written notice to the Warrant Agent; provided, that the
Warrant Agent shall not be removed until a successor Warrant Agent meeting the
qualifications hereof shall have been appointed and provided further that in
the event AmWest is the holder of any Warrants at such time, the Company shall
obtain the consent of AmWest, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) Any successor Warrant Agent, whether appointed by the
Company or by a court, shall be a corporation organized, in good standing and
doing business under the laws of the United States of America or any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, and authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or
state authority and having a combined capital and surplus of not less than
$10,000,000. The combined capital and surplus of any such successor Warrant
Agent shall be deemed to be the combined capital and surplus as set forth in
the most recent report of its condition published prior to its appointment
pursuant to law or to the requirements of a Federal or state supervising or
examining authority. After appointment, any successor Warrant Agent shall be
vested with all the authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties and
obligations of its predecessor Warrant Agent with like effect as if originally
named as Warrant Agent hereunder, without any further assurance, conveyance,
act or deed; provided, however, that in no event shall any successor Warrant
Agent be liable for any breach, default or failure of performance by the
predecessor Warrant Agent of any covenant or obligation under this Agreement
existing on the date the successor Warrant Agent assumes authority pursuant to
this Section 6.02. If for any reason it becomes necessary or appropriate, the
predecessor Warrant Agent shall execute and deliver, at the expense of the
Company, an instrument transferring to such successor Warrant Agent all the
authority, powers and rights of such predecessor Warrant Agent hereunder; and
upon request of any successor Warrant Agent, the Company shall make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver any and all instruments in writing to more fully and
effectually vest in and confirm to such successor Warrant Agent all such
authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties and obligations. Upon assumption
by a successor Warrant Agent of the duties and responsibilities hereunder, the
predecessor Warrant Agent shall

26
<PAGE> 31
deliver and transfer, at the expense of the Company, to the successor Warrant
Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder. As soon as practicable
after such appointment, the Company shall give notice thereof to the
predecessor Warrant Agent, the registered holders of the Warrants and each
transfer agent for the shares of its Class B Common Stock. Failure to give
such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of the
appointment of the successor Warrant Agent.

(d) Any corporation into which the Warrant Agent may be
merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from
any merger or consolidation to which the Warrant Agent shall be a party, shall
be the successor Warrant Agent under this Agreement without any further act,
provided that such corporation is eligible for appointment as a successor to
the Warrant Agent. Any such successor Warrant Agent shall promptly cause
notice of its succession as Warrant Agent to be mailed to the Company and to
the registered holder of each Warrant Certificate. In case at the time such
successor Warrant Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement,
any of the Warrant Certificates shall have been countersigned but not
delivered, any such successor Warrant Agent may adopt the countersignature of
the original Warrant Agent and deliver such Warrant Certificates so
countersigned, and in case at that time any of the Warrant Certificates shall
not have been countersigned, any successor to the Warrant Agent may countersign
such Warrant Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Warrant Agent
or in the name of the successor Warrant Agent; and in all such cases Warrant
Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Warrant Certificates and
in this Agreement.

(e) In case at any time the name of the Warrant Agent shall
be changed and at such time any of the Warrant Certificates shall have been
countersigned but not delivered, the Warrant Agent may adopt the
countersignatures under its prior name and deliver such Warrant Certificates so
countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Warrant Certificates shall
not have been countersigned, the Warrant Agent may countersign such Warrant
Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such
cases such Warrant Certificates shall have the full force provided in the
Warrant Certificates and in this Agreement.

SECTION 6.03. Compensation; Further Assurances. The Company
agrees (i) that it will pay the Warrant Agent the fees set forth in Exhibit B
for its services as Warrant Agent hereunder and, except as otherwise expressly
provided, will pay or reimburse the Warrant Agent upon demand for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Warrant
Agent in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the
reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel)
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its or any
of their negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; and (ii) that it

27
<PAGE> 32
will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed,
executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts,
instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Warrant Agent
for the carrying out or performing of the provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.04. Reliance on Counsel. The Warrant Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the
written opinion of such counsel or any advice of legal counsel subsequently
confirmed by a written opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection to the Warrant Agent as to any action taken or
omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such written opinion or
advice, provided that such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

SECTION 6.05. Proof of Actions Taken. Whenever in the
performance of its duties under this Agreement the Warrant Agent shall deem it
necessary or desirable that any matter be proved or established by the Company
prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such matter
(unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed)
may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Warrant Agent, be deemed to
be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to
the Warrant Agent; and such Officers' Certificate shall, in the absence of bad
faith on the part of the Warrant Agent be full authority to the Warrant Agent
for any action taken, suffered or omitted in good faith by it under the
provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate; but in its
discretion the Warrant Agent may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such
fact or matter or may require such further or additional evidence as to it may
deem reasonable.

SECTION 6.06. Correctness of Statements. The Warrant Agent
shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or
recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Warrant Certificates (except its
countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, and all such
statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the
Company only.

SECTION 6.07. Validity of Agreement. The Warrant Agent shall
not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or
the execution and delivery hereof (other than such execution and delivery by
the Warrant Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Warrant
Certificates (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible
for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this
Agreement or in any Warrant Certificate; nor shall it by any act hereunder be
deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or
reservation of any shares of Class B Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement or any Warrants or as to whether any

28
<PAGE> 33
shares of Class B Common Stock will, when issued, be validly issued and fully
paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 6.08. Use of Agents. The Warrant Agent may
execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform
any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents and
the Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of
any agent or attorney, provided due care had been exercised in the appointment
and continued employment thereof.

SECTION 6.09. Liability of Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent
shall incur no liability or responsibility to the Company or to any holder of
Warrants for any action taken in reliance on any notice, resolution, waiver,
consent, order, certificate, or other paper, document or instrument believed by
it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or presented by the proper party
or parties. The Company agrees to indemnify the Warrant Agent and hold it
harmless against any and all liabilities, including judgments, costs and
reasonable counsel fees, for anything done or omitted in good faith by the
Warrant Agent in the execution of this Warrant Agreement, except as a result of
the Warrant Agent's negligence or willful misconduct or bad faith.

SECTION 6.10. Legal Proceedings. The Warrant Agent shall be
under no obligation to institute any action, suit or legal proceeding or to
take any other action likely to involve expense unless the Company or one or
more holders of Warrants shall furnish the Warrant Agent with reasonable
security and indemnity for any costs and expenses which may be incurred, but
this provision shall not affect the power of the Warrant Agent to take such
action as the Warrant Agent may consider proper, whether with or without any
such security or indemnity.

SECTION 6.11. Other Transactions in Securities of the
Company. The Warrant Agent in its individual or any other capacity may become
the owner of the Warrants or other securities of the Company, or become
pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be
interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as
fully and freely as though it were not Warrant Agent under this Warrant
Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Warrant Agent from acting in any
other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.

SECTION 6.12. Actions as Agent. The Warrant Agent shall act
hereunder solely as agent and not in a ministerial capacity, and its duties
shall be determined solely by the provisions hereof. The Warrant Agent shall
not be liable for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in good faith
in connection with this Agreement except for its own negligence or willful
misconduct or bad faith.

29
<PAGE> 34
SECTION 6.13. Appointment and Acceptance of Agency. The
Company hereby appoints the Warrant Agent to act as agent for the Company in
accordance with the instructions set forth in this Agreement, and the Warrant
Agent hereby accepts the agency established by this Agreement and agrees to
perform the same upon the terms and conditions herein set forth.

purpose of determining the date of exercise, only upon surrender hereof to the
Company at the Warrant Agent's Office, with the Election to Exercise Form on
the reverse hereof duly completed and signed, and upon payment in full to the
Warrant Agent for the account of the Company of the Warrant Price (a) in cash,
(b) by certified or official bank check, or (c) by any combination of the
foregoing, and upon compliance with and subject to the conditions set forth
herein and in the Warrant Agreement. Capitalized terms that are not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Warrant
Agreement (as hereinafter defined).

The Warrant Price and, at the Company's option, either (1) the
number of shares of Class B Common Stock purchasable on the exercise of each
Warrant or (2) the number of Warrants outstanding, are subject to adjustment in
certain events as provided in the Warrant Agreement. In the event the Company
elects to adjust the number of Warrants outstanding rather than the number of
shares of Class B Common Stock purchasable on the exercise of each Warrant, the
Company shall cause the Warrant Agent to distribute to registered holders of
Warrant Certificates either Warrant Certificates representing any additional
Warrants

A-1
<PAGE> 39
issuable pursuant to the adjustment or substitute Warrant Certificates to
replace all outstanding Warrant Certificates in accordance with the provisions
of the Warrant Agreement. The Company shall not be required to issue fractions
of Warrants or Warrant Certificates evidencing fractional Warrants upon any
such adjustment or otherwise, but the Company shall make adjustment in cash or
scrip for any fraction of a Warrant which the registered holder of Warrants
would have been entitled to receive upon such adjustment or otherwise on the
basis of the then-current market value of such fraction of a Warrant (computed
as provided in the Warrant Agreement).

This Warrant Certificate is issued under and in accordance
with the Warrant Agreement dated as of August 25, 1994 (herein called the
"Warrant Agreement"), between the Company and the Warrant Agent and is subject
to and is to be construed in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
Warrant Agreement, which terms and provisions are hereby incorporated by
reference herein and made a part hereof. Every holder of this Warrant
Certificate consents to all of the terms contained in the Warrant Agreement by
acceptance hereof. A copy of the Warrant Agreement is available for inspection
by the registered holder hereof at the Warrant Agent's Office.

The Company shall not be required upon the exercise of the
Warrants represented hereby to issue fractions of shares of Class B Common
Stock, to distribute stock certificates that evidence fractional shares of
Class B Common Stock or to issue Warrant Certificates representing fractional
Warrants, but shall make adjustment in cash or scrip for any fraction of a
share which the same registered holder of Warrants exercised in the same
transaction would have been entitled to purchase on the basis of the
then-current market value of any such fraction of a share (computed as provided
in the Warrant Agreement). If the Warrants represented hereby shall be
exercised in part, the registered holder hereof shall be entitled to receive,
upon surrender hereof, another Warrant Certificate for the balance of the
number of whole Warrants not exercised as provided in the Warrant Agreement.

Commencing on the day after the Distribution Date, this
Warrant Certificate may be exchanged either separately or in combination with
other Warrant Certificates at the Warrant Agent's Office for new Warrant
Certificates representing the same aggregate number of Warrants evidenced by
the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates exchanged, upon surrender of
this Warrant Certificate and upon compliance with and subject to the conditions
set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement.

Commencing on the day after the Distribution Date, this
Warrant Certificate is transferable at the Warrant Agent's Office by the
registered holder hereof in Person or by his attorney duly authorized in
writing, upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate

A-2
<PAGE> 40
and upon compliance with and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in
the Warrant Agreement. Upon any such transfer, a new Warrant Certificate or
new Warrant Certificates of different denominations, representing in the
aggregate a like number of Warrants, will be issued to the transferee. Every
holder of Warrants, by accepting this Warrant Certificate, consents and agrees
with the Company, the Warrant Agent and with every subsequent holder of this
Warrant Certificate that until due presentation for the registration of
transfer of this Warrant Certificate on the Warrant Register maintained by the
Warrant Agent, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the Person
in whose name this Warrant Certificate is registered as the absolute and lawful
owner for all purposes whatsoever and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent
shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The Company is authorized by the Warrant Agreement to suspend
the exercise of all Warrants for any period during which any shares of Class B
Common Stock reserved for exercise of Warrants require, under any Federal or
state law or rule or regulation of any national securities exchange,
registration with or approval of any governmental authority or listing on any
national securities exchange and such registration, approval or listing is not
in effect.

Nothing contained in the Warrant Agreement or in this Warrant
Certificate shall be construed as conferring on the holder of any Warrants or
his transferee any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company.

This Warrant Certificate shall not be valid unless
countersigned manually by the Warrant Agent.

The Warrant Agreement and each Warrant Certificate, including
this Warrant Certificate, shall be deemed a contract made under the laws of the
State of New York and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

5.1 Each party hereto recognizes and agrees
that a violation of any term, provision, or condition of this
Agreement may cause irreparable damage to the other parties
which is difficult or impossible to quantify or ascertain and
that the award of any sum of damages may not be adequate
relief to such other parties. Each party hereto therefore
agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the
other party or parties shall, in addition to any remedies at
law which may be available, have the right to obtain
appropriate
<PAGE> 13

- 13 -

equitable (including, but not limited to, injunctive) relief.
All remedies hereunder shall be cumulative and not exclusive.

5.2 In addition to any other remedies
available at law or in equity, each party hereto agrees that
the Company shall have the right (a) to withhold transfer, and
to instruct any transfer agent for securities of the Company
to withhold transfer, of any certificates evidencing shares of
Common Stock held by AmWest or any partner or Affiliate of
AmWest or transferee if the Company reasonably believes that
such transfer would not be in material compliance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, unless the transferee
provides to the Company an opinion of legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Company that such transfer will be in
material compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, and
(b) to require any person requesting transfer of securities
subject to this Agreement to provide such information as
mayreasonably be requested by the Company regarding ownership
of securities, affiliations, if any, between the party
requesting transfer and the transferee and such other matters
pertaining to the transfer as may be appropriate to enable the
Company to determine the compliance of the proposed transfer
of securities with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

6. TERMINATION.

terminate without any action by any party on the day
immediately preceding the Third Annual Meeting and shall not
be extended except in accordance with Section 7.3. Upon such
termination, the rights and obligations of each party
hereunder shall terminate and the provisions of this Agreement
shall be of no force and effect; provided that no such
termination shall relieve any person or entity from liability
for breach or default of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

6.2 GPA's rights and obligations under this
Agreement (other than its obligations under Section 2.1(g))
shall terminate immediately and without notice upon the

6.1, (b) the sale or transfer by GPA of equity securities of
the Company resulting in the holding by GPA of less than two
percent (2%) of the voting equity securities of the Company
(on a fully diluted basis), or (c) any occurrence, other than
as described in clause (b) above, resulting in the holding by
GPA of less than two percent (2%) of the voting equity

the Company files a Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, or other
written report or statement, that is delivered to GPA and a

information as to the Company's total issued and outstanding

"Determination Date") from which GPA can determine whether it
holds less
<PAGE> 14

Company (on a fully diluted basis) and (ii) GPA fails to
acquire (by purchase or otherwise) sufficient voting equity
securities of the Company such that it holds at least two
percent (2%) of the voting equity securities of the Company
(on a fully diluted basis) determined as of the Determination
Date within thirty-five (35) days after delivery of such Form
10-Q, or provision of such report or statement to GPA, and to
give prompt notice of such acquisition to the Company and a
copy to the party designated in Section 7.1, as herein
provided, following the expiration of such 35-day period.

to effect such registration and sale in accordance with the intended method or
methods of disposition specified by such Holders.

(f) Withdrawal. Any Holder participating in a registration
pursuant to this Agreement shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of its
Registrable Securities from such registration at any time prior to the
effective date of the registration statement covering such securities; provided
that, in the event of a withdrawal from a registration effected pursuant to
Section 2.2, such registration shall be deemed to have been effected for
purposes of Section 2.5(c) unless (i) the Requesting Holder and any
Participating Holders shall have paid or reimbursed the Company for fifty
percent (50)% of the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses paid by the
Company hereunder or (ii) the Requesting Holder elects to terminate such
registration due to the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change; provided,
however, that during the term of this Agreement only one such withdrawal shall
be permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso.

(g) Registration Procedures. In connection with the
Company's obligations to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this
Agreement, the Company will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to effect such

pursuant thereto the Company will as expeditiously as possible:

(i) prepare and (as soon thereafter as practicable) file

filing of such registration statement, in no event later than seven
(7) days prior to such filing), the Company will furnish to the
Participating Holders or their counsel copies of reasonably complete
drafts of all such documents proposed to be filed (excluding exhibits,
which shall be made available upon request by any Participating

any information contained therein and the Company will make the
corrections reasonably requested by such Holder with respect to
information relating to such Holder or the plan of distribution of the
Registrable Securities prior to filing any such registration
statement, amendment, supplement or exhibit;

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection therewith (A) as reasonably requested by any Participating
Holder to which such registration statement relates (but only to the

Holder) and (B) as may be necessary to keep such registration
statement effective for the applicable Shelf Period in the case of a
Shelf Registration Statement or six (6) months in the case of a
registration effected pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.3 (or such shorter
period as shall be necessary to complete the distribution of the
securities covered thereby, but not before the expiration of the
applicable period referred to in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act
and Rule 174 thereunder), and comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the sale or other disposition of all
securities covered by such registration statement during such period
in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition by
the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such registration
statement;

(iii) furnish to each Holder covered by, and each
underwriter or agent participating in the disposition of securities
under, such registration statement such number of conformed copies of
such registration statement and of each

17
<PAGE> 21
such amendment and supplement thereto (in each case excluding all
exhibits and documents incorporated by reference, which exhibits and
documents shall be furnished to any such Person upon request), such
number of copies of the prospectus (which in the case of Shelf
Registration Statements, shall be substantially the same prospectus
for both such Shelf Registration Statements) contained in such
registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any
summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424
under the Securities Act relating to such Holder's Registrable
Securities, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act,
and such other documents as such Holder, underwriter or agent may
reasonably request to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;

(iv) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to register or
qualify all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by
such registration statement under (A) with respect to the Shelf
Registration Statements, all blue sky and other securities laws and
(B) with respect to a registration effected pursuant to Section 2.2,
all applicable blue sky and other securities laws, and to keep such
registration or qualification in effect for so long as such
registration statement remains in effect, and take any other action
which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Holder
to consummate the disposition of the securities owned by such Holder,
except that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to
(a) qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of this
clause (iv) be obligated to be so qualified, (b) subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or (c) consent to general service of
process in any jurisdiction;

(v) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities applicable to the Company as may be reasonably necessary
to enable the seller or sellers thereof (or underwriter or agent, if
any) to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in such
registration statement;

(vi) furnish to each Holder of Registrable Equity
Securities or Registrable Debt Securities covered by such registration
statement a signed counterpart, addressed to such Holder (and

effective date of such registration statement (and, if such
registration includes an underwritten public

18
<PAGE> 22
offering, dated the date of the closing under the underwriting 
agreement), and

(B) unless otherwise precluded under applicable
accounting rules, a "comfort" letter, dated the effective date
of such registration statement (and, if such registration
includes an underwritten public offering, dated the date of
the closing under the underwriting agreement), signed by the
independent public accountants who have certified the
Company's financial statements included in such registration
statement,

in each case, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such
Holder (and underwriter or agent and their respective counsel) and
covering substantially the same matters with respect to such
registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and, in
the case of the accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent
to the date of such financial statements, as are customarily covered
in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' letters delivered
to the underwriter or agent in underwritten public offerings of
securities;

(vii) promptly notify each Holder and any underwriter or
agent participating in the disposition of Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,

Company as a result of which, the prospectus included in such
registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, and promptly prepare and furnish to such Holder (or
underwriter or agent, if any) a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary
so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities,
such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances under which they were made;

(viii) otherwise use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but not more than fifteen (15) months) after the effective date of
the registration statement, an earnings statement satisfying the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158

19
<PAGE> 23
promulgated thereunder, and furnish to each Holder covered by such
registration statement or any participating underwriter or agent at
least five (5) business days prior to the filing a copy of any
amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus;

(ix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent
and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement from and after a date not later than the
effective date of such registration statement;

(x) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (A) list, on or
prior to the effective date of such registration statement, all
Registrable Equity Securities covered by such registration statement
on any securities exchange on which any of the Registrable Equity
Securities is then listed, if any or (B) have authorized for quotation
and/or listing, as applicable, on the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ") of the
National Market System of NASDAQ if the Registrable Equity Securities
so qualify; in each case subject to the applicable listing
requirements of the respective securities exchange or NASDAQ;

(xi) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities
and each underwriter or agent participating in the disposition of such
Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with
any filings required to be made with the National Association of
Securities Dealers;

(xii) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prevent the
issuance by the SEC or any other governmental agency or court of a
stop order, injunction or other order suspending the effectiveness of
such registration statement and, if such an order is issued, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause such order to be lifted as
promptly as practicable;

(xiii) take such other actions as the Requisite Holders of
such Registrable Securities shall reasonably request in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(xiv) promptly notify each seller and the underwriter or
agent, if any:

(A) when such registration statement or any
prospectus used in connection therewith, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, has been filed and,
with respect to such registration statement or any

20
<PAGE> 24
post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become
effective;

(B) of any written comments from the SEC with
respect to any filing referred to in clause (A) and of any
written request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to
such registration statement or prospectus;

(C) of the notification to the Company by the SEC
of its initiation of any proceeding with respect to, or of the
issuance by the SEC of, any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such registration statement; and

(D) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the
applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction;

(xv) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities
and each underwriter or agent participating in the distribution of
such Registrable Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and
delivery of certificates (which shall not bear any restrictive
legends, other than as required by applicable law, the Investment
Agreement or the Note Purchase Agreement or the agreement pursuant to
which the Secondary Registrable Debt Securities are acquired on an
initial issue by any Fidelity Fund or Lehman) representing securities
sold under a registration statement hereunder, and enable such
securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as
such seller, underwriter or agent may request and keep available and
make available to the Company's transfer agent, prior to the
effectiveness of such registration statement, an adequate supply of
such certificates;

(xvi) not later than the effective date of such registration
statement, provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities
covered by a registration statement hereunder;

(xvii) incorporate in the registration statement or any
amendment, supplement or post-effective amendment thereto such
information as each Holder, the underwriter or agent (if any) or their
respective counsel may reasonably request to be included therein with
respect to any Registrable Securities being sold by such Holder to
such underwriter or agent, the purchase price being paid therefor by
such underwriter or agent and any other terms of the offering of such
Registrable Securities;

21
<PAGE> 25
(xviii) during any period when a prospectus is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act, make periodic filings with the SEC
pursuant to and containing the information required by the Exchange
Act (whether or not the Company is required to make such filings
pursuant to such Act); and

(xix) in connection with an underwritten offering, participate, 
to the extent reasonably requested by the Requisite Holders of the 
securities included in the offering or the managing underwriter for 
the offering, in customary efforts to sell the securities under the 
offering.

(h) Agreements of Certain Holders. (i) Each Holder of
Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder, the Registrable
Securities held by such Holder and the intended plan of distribution of such
securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing
in connection with such registration. If any registration statement refers to
Investor, Lehman, any Fidelity Fund or any of their respective Affiliates by
name or otherwise as the holder of any securities of the Company, then such
Holder shall have the right to require that such reference be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to such Holder or in the event that such reference to
such Holder by name or otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any
similar federal or state blue sky statute and the rules and regulations
thereunder then in force, the deletion of the reference to such Holder.

(ii) Each Holder of Registrable Securities as to which any
registration is being effected agrees, by acquisition of such Registrable
Securities, that upon receipt of any notice (a "Suspension Notice") from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in clause (vii) of
Section 2.5(g), such Holder will forthwith discontinue such Holder's
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement
relating to such Registrable Securities until such Holder's receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by clause (vii)
of Section 2.5(g) (the period from the date on which such Holder receives a
Suspension Notice to the date on which such Holder receives copies of the
supplemental or amended prospectus being herein called the "Suspension
Period"). The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to end the
Suspension Period as promptly as practicable. In the event the Company shall
give any such notice, the periods referred to in Section 2.5(c) and clause (ii)
of Section 2.5(g) shall be extended by a number of days equal to the number of
days of the Suspension Period.

22
<PAGE> 26
2.6 Underwritten Offerings.

(a) Underwritten Offerings in Connection with a Shelf or a
Demand Registration. If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten
offering in connection with a registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, the
Company will enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters for
such offering, such agreement (i) to be satisfactory in substance and form to
(A) the Company and (B) to the Requisite Holders of each of the Registrable
Equity Securities and the Registrable Debt Securities included in such
offering, acting together, (provided that the Company shall not be required to
have in effect more than one underwriting agreement at any one time in
connection with the Shelf Registration Statements) and (ii) to contain such
representations and warranties by the Company and such Holders and such other
terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of such type, including,
without limitation, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in
Section 2.8. Each of Investor, Lehman and each Fidelity Fund (so long as it or
any of its Affiliates holds Registrable Securities to be included in such
registration) shall be a party to such underwriting agreement and may, at its
option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and
the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such
underwriters shall also be made to and for its benefit and that any or all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to its obligations thereunder.

(b) Underwritten Offerings in Connection with Piggyback
Registrations. If the Company at any time proposes to register any of its
equity securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by Section 2.3 and
such securities are to be distributed by or through one or more underwriters,
the Company will, if requested by any Participating Holder and subject to
Sections 2.3(b) and 2.3(c), arrange for such underwriters to include all of the
Registrable Equity Securities to be offered and sold by such Holder or Holders
among the securities to be distributed by such underwriters. The Holders of
Registrable Equity Securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be
parties to the underwriting agreement between the Company and such
underwriters, provided that such agreement is reasonably satisfactory in
substance and form to the Company and the Requisite Holders of each of the
Registrable Equity Securities included in such offering, and may, at their
option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and
the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such
underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such Holders and that
any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters 
under such 

23
<PAGE> 27
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such 
Holders thereunder.

2.7 Preparation; Reasonable Investigation. In connection
with the preparation and filing of each registration statement under the
Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will give the Holders of
Registrable Securities to be registered under such registration statement,
their underwriters or agents, if any, and their respective counsel and
accountants reasonable access to its books and records and such opportunities
to discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the independent
public accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall be
necessary, in the opinion of such Holders' and such underwriters' or agents'
respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the Securities Act.

2.8 Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each Holder
participating in an offering of securities provided for as described herein
(including, without limitation, under a Shelf Registration Statement or any
replacement Shelf Registration Statement), its directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, investment advisers, agents and Affiliates, either
direct or indirect (and each such Affiliate's directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, investment advisers and agents), and each other
Person, if any, who controls such Persons within the meaning of the Securities
Act (each such Person, an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, joint or several (each a "Loss" and
collectively, "Losses"), to which such Indemnified Party may become subject
under the Securities Act or otherwise, to the extent that such Losses (or
actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such
securities were registered under the Securities Act (including all documents
incorporated therein by reference), any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and the Company will reimburse such Indemnified Party
for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection
with investigating or defending against any such Loss, action or proceeding;
provided that in any such case the Company shall not be liable to any
particular Indemnified Party to the extent that such Loss (or action or
proceeding in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or

24
<PAGE> 28
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus,
summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by such Indemnified Party
specifically for inclusion therein; and provided, further, that the Company
shall not be liable in any such case to the extent it is finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction that any such Loss (or action or proceeding
in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made

(i) in any such preliminary prospectus, if (A) it was the
responsibility of such Indemnified Party to provide the Person
asserting such Loss with a current copy of the prospectus and such
Indemnified Party failed to deliver or cause to be delivered a copy of
the prospectus to such Person after the Company had furnished such
Indemnified Party with a sufficient number of copies of the same prior
to the sale of Registrable Securities to the Person asserting such
Loss and (B) the prospectus corrected such untrue statement or
omission; or

(ii) in such prospectus, if such untrue statement or omission is
corrected in an amendment or supplement to such prospectus and such
amendment or supplement has been delivered to the Indemnified Party
prior to the sale of Registrable Securities to the Person asserting
such Loss and the Indemnified Party thereafter fails to deliver the
prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with
such sale after the Company had furnished such Indemnified Party (in
accordance with the notice provisions contained in Section 10 for
Persons who are parties to this Agreement) with a sufficient number of
copies of the same for delivery to purchasers of securities.

Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive
the transfer of such securities by such Indemnified Party. The Company shall
also indemnify each other Person who participates (including as an underwriter)
in the offering or sale of Registrable Securities hereunder, their officers and
directors and each other Person, if any, who controls any such participating
Person within the meaning of the Securities Act to the same extent as provided
above with respect to Indemnified Parties.

(b) Indemnification by the Sellers. Each Holder
participating in a Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2.1
agrees to (and the Company may require, as a condition to including any
Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to Sections
2.2 or 2.3 and

25

<PAGE> 29
as a condition to indemnifying such sellers pursuant to this Section 2.8, that
the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it
from each prospective seller of securities included in any such offering
regarding its agreement to) indemnify and hold harmless and reimburse (in the
same manner and to the same extent as set forth in paragraph (a) of this
Section 2.8) the Company, each director, officer, employee and agent of the
Company, and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any Losses (or actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arising out
of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any such Shelf Registration Statement or other registration
statement pursuant to which securities of such Holder are registered under the
Securities Act (including all documents incorporated therein by reference), any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged
omission from such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, if (but only if) such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by such prospective seller
specifically for inclusion therein; provided, however, that such prospective
seller shall not be obligated to provide such indemnity to the extent that such
Losses result, directly or indirectly, from the failure of the Company to
promptly amend or take action to correct or supplement any such registration
statement, prospectus, amendment or supplement based on corrected or
supplemental information provided in writing by such prospective seller to the
Company expressly for such purpose; and provided further, that the obligation
to provide indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.8(b) shall be several,
and not joint and several, among such indemnifying parties. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 2.8(b) to the contrary, in no event shall the
liability of any prospective seller under such indemnity be greater in amount
than the amount of the proceeds received by such seller upon the sale of its
Registrable Securities in the offering to which the Losses relate. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director,
officer, employee, agent or participating or controlling Person and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such prospective seller.

(c) Notices of Claims, etc. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
involving a claim referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.8, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
indemnifying party,

26
<PAGE> 30
give prompt written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action,
provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this
Section 2.8, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action
is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof (such assumption
to constitute its acknowledgement of its agreement to indemnify the indemnified
party with respect to such matters), jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
for any legal fees or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that if, in such indemnified party's
reasonable judgment, a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, such indemnified party
shall be entitled to separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party;
and provided, further, that, unless there exists a conflict of interest among
indemnified parties, all indemnified parties in respect of such claim shall be
entitled to only one counsel or firm of counsel for all such indemnified
parties. In the event an indemnifying party shall not be entitled, or elects
not, to assume the defense of a claim, such indemnifying party shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel or firm of
counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party in respect of
such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any such indemnified party a
conflict of interest exists between such indemnified party and any other of
such indemnified parties in respect of such claim, in which event the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of one
additional counsel or firm of counsel for such indemnified parties. No
indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (i) does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such indemnified party of a release from all Losses in respect of such claim or
litigation or (ii) would impose injunctive relief on such indemnified party.
No indemnifying party shall be subject to any Losses for any settlement made
without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Other Indemnification. The provisions of this Section
2.8 shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution
which an indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or
otherwise.

27

<PAGE> 31
(e) Indemnification Payments. The indemnification required
by this Section 2.8 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof
during the course of the investigation or defense, promptly as and when bills
are received or Losses are incurred.

(f) Contribution. If for any reason the foregoing indemnity
and reimbursement is unavailable or is insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.8, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of any Loss (or actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, in respect thereof), including, without limitation,
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such Loss, action or proceeding, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other. The relative
fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
2.8(f) to the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the Company) shall be
required pursuant to this Section 2.8(f) to contribute any amount in excess of
the amount by which the net proceeds received by such indemnifying party from
the sale of Registrable Securities in the offering to which the Losses of the
indemnified parties relate exceeds the amount of any damages which such
indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue
statement or omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

2.9 Liquidated Damages.

(a) If, (i) as of the Initial Effective Date, the Initial
Shelf Registration Statement has been suspended or is not otherwise effective
or (ii) as of the Secondary Effective Date, the Secondary Shelf Registration
Statement has been suspended or is not otherwise effective, the Company shall

case of any Warrant, $.65 per 1,000 shares based on the number of shares
issuable upon exercise of the Warrant), for each week specified in subsection

Debt Securities, $.10 per $1,000 outstanding principal amount of such
Registrable Debt Securities and (ii) in the case of Registrable Equity
Securities, $.40 per 1,000 shares (or in the case of any Warrant, $.40 per
1,000 shares based on the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the
Warrant), for each week specified in subsection (g) below.

(e) If the stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of
a Shelf Registration Statement referred to in clause (d) above shall not have
been cured within ninety (90) days after such stop order was imposed or the
effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement was otherwise suspended, the
daily liquidated damages set forth in clause (d) above shall increase to an
amount equal to (i) in the case of Registrable Debt Securities, $.15 per $1,000
outstanding principal amount of such Registrable Debt Securities and (ii) in
the case of Registrable Equity Securities, $.65 per 1,000 shares (or in the
case of any Warrant, $.65 per 1,000 shares based on the number of 

29

<PAGE> 33
shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant), for each week specified in 
subsection (g) below.

(f) If the stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of
a Shelf Registration Statement referred to in clause (d) above shall not have
been cured within one hundred and eighty (180) days after such stop order was
imposed or the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement was otherwise
suspended, the daily liquidated damages set forth in clause (d) above shall
increase to an amount equal to (i) in the case of Registrable Debt Securities,
$.20 per $1,000 outstanding principal amount of such Registrable Debt
Securities and (ii) in the case of Registrable Equity Securities, $.90 per
1,000 shares (or in the case of any Warrant, $.90 per 1,000 shares based on the
number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant), for each week
specified in subsection (g) below.

(g) The liquidated damages payable to any Holder set forth in
this Section 2.9 shall begin accruing on the date on which the event triggering
such liquidated damages occurs and shall cease to accrue on the earlier of the
date after the SEC reinstates the effectiveness of the relevant Shelf
Registration Statement or otherwise declares such Shelf Registration Statement
to be effective and the date after the SEC declares effective a registration
statement effected pursuant to Section 2.2 covering such Holder's Registrable
Securities. The Company will pay the liquidated damages due with respect to
any Registrable Securities at the end of each month during which such damages
accrue. Liquidated damages shall be paid in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to each Holder of at least ten percent (10%) of Registrable
Equity Securities (but not less than an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of Class
A Common, Class B Common and shares issuable upon exercise of Warrants) or at
least ten percent (10%) of the aggregate principal amount of Registrable Debt
Securities (but not less than $10 Million of aggregate principal amount of
Registrable Debt Securities) entitled to receive such liquidated damages to the
accounts designated by such Holders, and all other Holders entitled to receive
such funds, shall be paid by check mailed to such other Holders at the address
shown in the records of the Company for such Holders; provided that for
purposes of this Section 2.9(g), all Fidelity Funds shall be considered a
single Holder.

(h) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Section
2.9, no liquidated damages shall be payable (i) during any period of time that
(A) a Shelf Registration Statement or any replacement Shelf Registration
Statement is suspended by the Company pursuant to the first proviso in Section
2.1(c), or (B) the Company is precluded from using or qualifying a Shelf
Registration Statement as a result of a change to the rules or regulations of
the SEC applicable thereto with which the Company is unable to comply after
exercising Commercially Reasonable 

30

<PAGE> 34
Efforts to so comply; and (ii) to any party, if, as a result of such party's 
acts or omissions, the Company is precluded from using or qualifying a Shelf 
Registration Statement.

(i) The parties hereto agree that (i) the liquidated damages
provided for in this Section 2.9 constitute a reasonable estimate of the
damages that will be suffered by each Holder covered or to be covered by a
Shelf Registration Statement by reason of the failure of such Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective and to remain effective in
accordance with this Agreement and (ii) such liquidated damages shall be the
sole remedy of each such Holder with respect to the matters set forth in this
Section 2.9.

3. Rule 144 and Rule 144A. (a) The Company will file the
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder and will take
such further action as Investor, Lehman and/or any Fidelity Fund may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable Investor,
Lehman and/or such Fidelity Fund to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by (i) Rule 144, (ii) Rule 144A or (iii) any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of Investor, Lehman
and/or any Fidelity Fund, the Company will deliver to Investor, Lehman and/or
such Fidelity Fund a written statement as to whether it has complied with such
requirements and will, at its expense, forthwith upon the request of Investor,
Lehman and/or such Fidelity Fund, deliver to Investor, Lehman and/or such
Fidelity Fund a certificate, signed by the Company's principal financial
officer, stating (A) the Company's name, address and telephone number
(including area code), (B) the Company's Internal Revenue Service
identification number, (C) the Company's SEC file number, (D) the amount of
shares of each class of capital stock outstanding as shown by the most recent
report or statement published by the Company, and (E) whether the Company has
filed the reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act for a period of
at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of such certificate and in addition
has filed the most recent annual report required to be filed thereunder.

(b) If at any time the Company is not required to file
reports in compliance with either Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, the Company at its expense will, forthwith upon the request of Investor,
Lehman and/or any Fidelity Fund, (i) make available adequate current public
information with respect to the Company within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)
of Rule 144 and (ii) deliver the information required by Section (d) of Rule
144A (such information to be "reasonably current" within the meaning of Section
(d)(4)(ii) of Rule 144A).

4. Term. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date
hereof and shall continue in full force and effect, subject to Section 18
hereof, until the eighth (8th) anniversary of the date hereof.

5. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or modified at any time; provided that each of (i) the Requisite
Holders of each of the Registrable Equity Securities and the Registrable Debt
Securities then outstanding and (ii) the Company has provided its written
consent to such amendment, supplement or modification; provided, however, that
no such amendment, supplement or modification which would prejudice the rights
expressly granted to Fidelity or any Fidelity Fund as a named party hereto
shall be effective without the written consent of Fidelity or such Fidelity
Fund, as the case may be; and provided further, that no such amendment,
supplement or modification which would prejudice the rights expressly granted
to Lehman as a named party hereto shall be effective without the written
consent of Lehman. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at
any time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such
waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same term
or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.

6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior
discussions and agreements between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof (including, without limitation, Section 11 of the Investment
Agreement) and contains the sole and entire agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

7. No Third-Party Beneficiary. The terms and provisions of
this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party, their
respective Successors or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person other
than (i) any Affiliate of Investor, Lehman, any Fidelity Fund, (ii) any
transferee, direct or indirect, of any of the Registrable Securities held by
Investor, Lehman, any Fidelity Fund or any of their respective Affiliates, or
(iii) any other Person entitled to notice of the registration of Registrable
Securities under Sections 2.2(d) or 2.3(a), to indemnity under Section 2.8 or
to liquidated damages under Section 2.9.

8. Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law,
(i) such provision will be fully severable, (ii) this Agreement will be
construed and enforced as 

32

<PAGE> 36
if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a 
part hereof, (iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain 
in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid 
or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom and (iv) in lieu of 
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added 
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

9. Nominees for Beneficial Owners. In the event that any
Registrable Securities are held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof,
the beneficial owner thereof may, at its election, be treated as the holder of
such Registrable Securities for purposes of request or other action by any
Holder or Holders pursuant to this Agreement or any determination of any amount
of shares of Registrable Securities held by any Holder or Holders of
Registrable Securities contemplated by this Agreement. If the beneficial owner
of any Registrable Securities so elects, the Company may require assurances
reasonably satisfactory to it of such owner's beneficial ownership of such
Registrable Securities. For purposes of this Agreement, "beneficial ownership"
and "beneficial owner" refer to beneficial ownership as defined in Rule 13d-3
(without regard to the 60-day provision in paragraph (d)(1)(i) thereof) under
the Exchange Act.

hereunder must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given only if

Any Person from time to time may change its address, facsimile number or other
information for the purpose of notices to that Person by giving notice in

11. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
Successors (including, in the case of the Company, the Company as reorganized
pursuant to the Plan) and permitted assigns. In addition, each of Investor,
Lehman, any Fidelity Fund, and each of their respective Affiliates may assign
any of its rights hereunder (in whole or in part) to one or more Affiliates or
to one or more direct or indirect transferees of its Registrable Securities,
provided, however, that any such assignment by Investor to one or more of its
Affiliates which results in the liquidation of its entire interest in the
Registrable Securities, either upon dissolution or otherwise, shall include a
designation of the transferee Affiliate or Affiliates who shall thereafter have
the right and authority to 

35

<PAGE> 39
exercise any notice or consent rights on the part of Investor set forth in this 
Agreement, and each other holder of Registrable Securities by means of an 
assignment by Investor shall be bound by the actions taken by such designated 
Affiliate(s), and provided further that any assignee which accepts the benefits 
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have accepted and be bound by all 
obligations on the part of the assignor hereunder. No such assignment shall be 
binding upon or obligate the Company to any such assignee unless and until (A) 
the Company shall have received notice of such assignment as herein provided, 
which notice shall (i) reference this Agreement and (ii) set forth the name and 
address of any assignee for the purpose of any notices hereunder or (B) such 
assignee can establish its beneficial or record ownership of any Registrable 
Securities and shall have provided the Company with the information called 
for by clause (A)(ii) of this Section 11.

12. Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of the
several sections and paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience
of reference only and do not define or limit the provisions hereof or otherwise
affect the meaning hereof.

13. Specific Performance. Except with respect to the matters
set forth in Section 2.9, the parties agree that, to the extent permitted by
law, (i) the obligations imposed on them in this Agreement are special, unique
and of an extraordinary character, and that in the event of a breach by any
such party damages would not be an adequate remedy; and (ii) each of the other
parties shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive and other
equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at
law or in equity.

14. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

15. Registration Rights to Others. Except for registration
rights granted by the Company to GPA under that certain Registration Rights
Agreement of even date herewith (the "GPA Registration Rights Agreement"), the
Company shall not provide to any other holder of its securities rights with
respect to the registration of such securities under the Securities Act without
the prior written consent of the Requisite Holders of each of the Registrable
Equity Securities and the Registrable Debt Securities then outstanding, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the
foregoing restriction shall not be applicable (i) to the grant by the Company
of "piggyback" registration rights which are subordinate in priority to the
rights of Holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to Sections 2.2(d) and
2.3(b), and (ii) to any grant of 

36

<PAGE> 40
any demand registration rights by the Company after exercise or termination of 
all demand registration rights set forth in Section 2.2, provided, however, 
that in regard to any such grant of demand registration rights each of Investor,
each Fidelity Fund, Lehman and each of their respective Affiliates shall have 
the right during the term of this Agreement to subscribe to or otherwise 
participate in such rights on equal terms, and on a pro rata basis, with the 
parties granted such rights. The Company represents and warrants that, other 
than as provided herein, it has not granted to any other Person rights with 
respect to the registration of any Registrable Securities or any other 
securities issued or to be issued by it.

16. Attorneys' Fees. In any action or proceeding brought to
enforce any provision of this Agreement or where any provision hereof is
validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees
in addition to any other available remedy.

17. Limitation of Liability. Each party to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that (i) this Agreement is not executed on behalf of or
binding upon any of the trustees, officers, directors, partners or shareholders
of any Fidelity Fund individually, but is binding only upon the assets and
property of each Fidelity Fund and (ii) the obligations of each Fidelity Fund
hereunder are several and not joint. With respect to the obligations of any
Fidelity Fund arising out of this Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall
look for payment or satisfaction of any claim solely to the assets and property
of such Fidelity Fund.

18. Termination of Certain Rights. The rights and
obligations hereunder of each of Investor, Lehman and each Fidelity Fund shall
terminate with respect to such party at such time when neither it nor any of
its respective Affiliates holds Registrable Securities, provided that the
provisions of Section 2.8 hereof, the rights of any party hereto with respect
to the breach of any provision hereof, and any obligation accrued as of the
date of termination (including any obligation accrued under Section 2.9 hereof)
shall survive termination of this Agreement.

19. No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not
hereafter enter into, modify, amend or waive any agreement with respect to its
securities if such agreement, modification, amendment or waiver would conflict
with the rights granted pursuant to this Agreement to the Holders of
Registrable Securities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject to Section 18 hereof, the Company will not amend, modify or waive, or
permit the amendment, modification or waiver of Sections 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3 of the
GPA Registration Rights Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Requisite Holders of 

37
<PAGE> 41
each of the Registrable Equity Securities and the Registrable Debt Securities 
then outstanding, provided, however, that Investor and any of its Affiliates 
(other than Mesa) shall not participate in any such consent and that any 
Registrable Equity Securities or Registrable Debt Securities held by such 
parties shall not be taken into account for the purpose of such consent.

20. Requisite Holders. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that the Company may, in connection with the taking of any action permitted to
be taken hereunder with the consent or approval of the Requisite Holders of the
Registrable Equity Securities or Registrable Debt Securities, rely in good
faith on a certificate from any such holder or holders stating that it holds or
is acting on behalf of a majority in interest of the Registrable Equity
Securities or a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Debt
Securities, as the case may be.

21. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument.

22. Repurchase Arrangement. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that all rights of Fidelity Copernicus Fund, L.P. ("Copernicus")
under this Agreement in respect of Registrable Debt Securities held by
Copernicus shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Copernicus,
Lehman Government Securities Inc. or any other transferee (including any
counterparty) of such Registrable Debt Securities, in each case as contemplated
by the repurchase arrangement described under "Plan of Distribution" as set
forth in the Company's S-1 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on June
26, 1994, as amended, provided that the Company shall have no obligations under
this Agreement with respect to any such Person other than Copernicus unless and
until it shall have been provided the notice of assignment or information
regarding ownership as set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement.

2.2. Demand Registration.

(a) Registration on Request. Except as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) below,

(i) at any time after the Shelf Period, GPA may
(so long as it or any of its Affiliates holds Registrable
Securities to be included in the registration) provide the
Company with a Notice of Demand (with a copy to AmWest); and

(ii) if at any time during the Shelf Period the
Shelf Registration Statement is not effective during a

GPA, AmWest (or any successor or other holder of such right) exercises its
right to a demand registration pursuant to Section 2.2(a) of the AmWest
Registration Rights Agreement, then GPA's Notice of Demand shall be deemed
revoked; provided, however that GPA shall have the right to request that the
Company include Registrable Securities held by GPA in the demand registration
requested by AmWest in accordance with and subject to Section 2.3 hereof and
Section 2.2 of the AmWest Registration Rights Agreement. If a Notice of Demand
made by GPA is deemed revoked pursuant to this Section 2.2(c), the Company

underwriter of such underwritten offering shall inform the Company and GPA by
letter of its belief that the amount of securities requested to be included in

include in such registration such amount of securities which the Company is so
advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering as follows:

Securities Act (other than by a registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any

or 2.2) in a form and in a manner that would permit registration of the
Registrable Securities, whether or not for sale for its own account, it will
give prompt (but in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to the proposed
date of filing the registration statement relating to such registration) notice
to all Holders of Registrable Securities of the Company's intention to do so
and of such Holders' rights under this Section 2.3. Upon the request of any
such Holder made within twenty (20) days after the receipt by such Holder of
any such notice (which request shall specify the Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Holder and the intended method or methods of
disposition thereof) (the "Piggyback Registration Notice"), the Company will
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to effect the registration under the
Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Company has been so
requested to register by the Holders thereof, to the extent required to permit
the disposition (in accordance with the intended method or methods thereof as
aforesaid) of the Registrable Securities so to be registered, provided that if,
at any time after giving notice of its intention to register any equity
securities and prior to the effective date of the registration statement filed
in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any
reason not to register or to delay registration of such equity securities, the
Company may, at its election, give notice of such determination to each such
Holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to register,
shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in
connection with such registration (but not from its obligation to pay all
Registration Expenses in connection therewith as provided in Section 2.5(b)),
without prejudice, however, to the right of GPA to request that such
registration be effected as a registration under Section 2.2, and (ii) in the
case of a determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay
registering any Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in
registering such other equity securities. No registration effected under this
Section 2.3 shall be deemed to have been effected pursuant to Section 2.1 or
2.2 (except for any right to demand registration which may be exercised
pursuant to the last clause of subsection (i) of the preceding sentence) or
shall relieve the Company of its obligation to effect any registration under
such Sections.

underwriters of recognized standing under underwriting terms appropriate for
such a transaction and (ii) the managing underwriter of such underwritten
offering shall inform the Company and the Holders requesting such registration
by letter of its belief that the amount of securities requested to be included
in such registration exceeds the amount which can be sold in (or during the
time of) such offering within a price range acceptable to the Company, then the
Company will include in such registration such amount of securities which the
Company is so advised can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering as
follows: first, all securities proposed by the Company to be sold for its own
account; second, such Registrable Equity Securities requested to be included in
such registration by AmWest, Lehman, or any Fidelity Fund or any of their
respective Affiliates under the

8
<PAGE> 11

such securities so proposed to be sold and so requested to be included by such
parties; third, such Registrable Equity Securities requested to be included in
such registration by other holders of such securities under the AmWest
Registration Rights Agreement pro rata on the basis of the amount of such
securities so proposed to be sold and so requested to be included by such
parties; fourth, such Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
registration by GPA or any of its Affiliates pro rata on the basis of the
amount of such securities so proposed to be sold and so requested to be
included by such parties; fifth such Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such registration by all other Holders pro rata on the basis of the
amount of such securities so proposed to be sold and so requested to be
included by such holders; and sixth, all other securities of the Company
requested to be included in such registration pro rata on the basis of the
amount of such securities so proposed to be sold and so requested to be
included.

(c) Priority in Secondary Piggyback Registrations. If
(i) a registration pursuant to this Section 2.3 involves an underwritten
secondary offering of the securities being registered for sale for the account
of AmWest, Fidelity or any of their respective Affiliates or transferees
pursuant to the AmWest Registration Rights Agreement, to be distributed (on a
firm commitment basis) by or through one or more underwriters of recognized
standing under underwriting terms appropriate for such a transaction and (ii)
the managing underwriter of such underwritten offering shall inform the Company
and Persons requesting such registration by letter of its belief that the
amount of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the
amount which can be sold in (or during the time of) such offering within a
price range acceptable to such Persons, then the Company will include in such
registration such amount of securities which the Company is so advised can be
sold in (or during the time of) such offering as follows: first, such
securities proposed to be sold for the account of AmWest, Lehman, any Fidelity
Fund or any of their respective Affiliates under the AmWest Registration Rights
Agreement pro rata on the basis of the amount of such securities so proposed to
be sold and so requested to be included by such parties; second, such

long as such registration statement remains in effect, and take any
other action which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable
such Holder to consummate the disposition of the securities owned by

required to (a) qualify generally to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the
requirements of this clause (iv) be obligated to be so qualified, (b)
subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (c) consent to
general service of process in any jurisdiction;

Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or

any) to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in such
registration statement;

(vi) furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement a signed counterpart, addressed

Company's financial statements included in such registration
statement,

in each case, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such
Holder (and underwriter or agent and their respective counsel) and
covering substantially the same matters with respect to such

the case of the accountants' letter, with respect to events subsequent
to the date of such financial statements, as are customarily covered
in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' letters delivered
to the underwriter or agent in underwritten public offerings of
securities;

(vii) promptly notify each Holder and any underwriter or
agent participating in the disposition of Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event known to the
Company as a result of which, the prospectus included in such
registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, and promptly prepare and furnish to such Holder (or
underwriter or agent, if any) a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary
so that, as thereafter delivered to the

12
<PAGE> 15
purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they
were made;

(viii) otherwise use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but not more than fifteen (15) months) after the effective date of
the registration statement, an earnings statement satisfying the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158
promulgated thereunder, and furnish to each Holder covered by such
registration statement or any participating underwriter or agent at
least five (5) business days prior to the filing a copy of any
amendment or supplement to such registration statement or prospectus;

(ix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent
and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement from and after a date not later than the
effective date of such registration statement;

(x) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (A) list, on

applicable, on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

stop order, injunction or other order suspending the effectiveness of
such registration statement and, if such an order is issued, use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause such order to be lifted as
promptly as practicable;

(xiii) take such other actions as the Requisite Holders of
such Registrable Securities shall reasonably request in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(xiv) promptly notify each seller and the underwriter or
agent, if any:

(A) when such registration statement or any
prospectus used in connection therewith, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, has been filed and, with respect to such
registration statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto, when the same has become effective;

13
<PAGE> 16
(B) of any written comments from the SEC with
respect to any filing referred to in clause (A) and of any
written request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to
such registration statement or prospectus;

(C) of the notification to the Company by the SEC
of its initiation of any proceeding with respect to, or of the
issuance by the SEC of, any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such registration statement; and

(D) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the
applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction;

(xv) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities
and each underwriter or agent participating in the
distribution of such Registrable Securities to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates (which shall
not bear any restrictive legends, other than as required by
applicable law) representing securities sold under a
registration statement hereunder, and enable such securities
to be in such denominations and registered in such names as
such seller, underwriter or agent may request and keep
available and make available to the Company's transfer agent,
prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement, an
adequate supply of such certificates;

(xvi) not later than the effective date of such
registration statement, provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable
Securities covered by a registration statement hereunder;

(xvii) incorporate in the registration statement or any
amendment, supplement or post-effective amendment thereto such
information as each Holder, the underwriter or agent (if any) or their
respective counsel may reasonably request to be included therein with
respect to any Registrable Securities being sold by such Holder to
such underwriter or agent, the purchase price being paid therefor by
such underwriter or agent and any other terms of the offering of such
Registrable Securities;

(xviii) during any period when a prospectus is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act, make periodic filings with the SEC
pursuant to and containing the information required by the Exchange
Act (whether or not the Company is required to make such filings
pursuant to such Act); and

(xix) in connection with an underwritten offering,
participate, to the extent reasonably requested by the Requisite
Holders or the managing underwriter for the offering, in customary
efforts to sell the securities under the offering.

(h) Agreements of Certain Holders. (i) Each Holder of
Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being effected shall
furnish to the Company such information regarding such Holder, the Registrable
Securities held by such Holder and the intended plan of distribution of such
securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing
in connection with such registration. If any registration statement refers to
GPA or any of its Affiliates by name or otherwise as the holder of any
securities of the Company, then such Holder shall have the right to require
that such reference be in a form reasonably satisfactory to such Holder or in
the event that

14
<PAGE> 17
such reference to such Holder by name or otherwise is not required by the
Securities Act or any similar federal or state blue sky statute and the rules
and regulations thereunder then in force, the deletion of the reference to such
Holder.

(ii) Each Holder of Registrable Securities as to which any
registration is being effected agrees, by acquisition of such Registrable
Securities, that upon receipt of any notice ("a Suspension Notice") from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in clause (vii) of
Section 2.5(g), such Holder will forthwith discontinue such Holder's
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement
relating to such Registrable Securities until such Holder's receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by clause (vii)
of Section 2.5(g) (the period from the date on which such Holder receives a
Suspension Notice to the date on which such Holder receives copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus being herein called the "Suspension Period").
The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to end the Suspension
Period as promptly as practicable. In the event the Company shall give any
such notice, the periods referred to in Section 2.5(c) and clause (ii) of
Section 2.5(g) shall be extended by a number of days equal to the number of
days of the Suspension Period.

2.5. Underwritten Offerings.

(a) Underwritten Offerings in Connection with a Shelf or
a Demand Registration. If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten
offering in connection with a registration pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, the
Company will enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters for
such offering, such agreement (i) to be satisfactory in substance and form to
the Company and to GPA (so long as it or any of its Affiliates holds
Registrable Securities to be included in such registration) and (ii) to contain
such representations and warranties by the Company and such Holders and such
other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of such type, including,
without limitation, indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in
Section 2.7. GPA (so long as it or any of its Affiliates holds Registrable
Securities to be included in such registration) shall be a party to such
underwriting agreement and may, at its option, require that any or all of the
representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the
Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and
for its benefit and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be
conditions precedent to its obligations thereunder.

(b) Underwritten Offerings in Connection with Piggyback
Registrations. If the Company at any time proposes to register any of its
equity securities under the Securities Act as contemplated by Section 2.3 and
such securities are to be distributed by or through one or more underwriters,
the Company will, if requested by any Participating Holder and subject to
Sections 2.3(b) and (c), arrange for such underwriters to include all of the
Registrable Securities to be offered and sold by such Holder or Holders among
the securities to be distributed by such underwriters. The Holders of
Registrable Securities to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties
to the underwriting agreement between the Company and such underwriters,
provided that such agreement is reasonably satisfactory in substance and form
to the Company and the Requisite Holders, and the Requisite Holders may, at
their option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by,
and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of
such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such Holders and
that any or all of the conditions prece-

15
<PAGE> 18
dent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement
be conditions precedent to the obligations of such Holders thereunder.

2.6. Preparation; Reasonable Investigation. In connection
with the preparation and filing of each registration statement under the
Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will give the Holders of
Registrable Securities to be registered under such registration statement,
their underwriters or agents, if any, and their respective counsel and
accountants reasonable access to its books and records and such opportunities
to discuss the business of the Company with its officers and the independent
public accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall be
necessary, in the opinion of such Holders' and such underwriter s' or agents'
respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the Securities Act.

2.7. Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each
Holder participating in an offering provided for as described herein
(including, without limitation, under the Shelf Registration Statement or any
replacement Shelf Registration Statement), its directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, investment advisers, agents and Affiliates, either
direct or indirect (and each such Affiliate's directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, investment advisers and agents), and each other
Person, if any, who controls such Persons within the meaning of the Securities
Act (each such Person, an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, joint or several (each a "Loss" and
collectively, "Losses"), to which such Indemnified Party may become subject
under the Securities Act or otherwise, to the extent that such Losses (or
actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of any material fact contained in any registration statement under which such
securities were registered under the Securities Act (including all documents
incorporated therein by reference), any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and the Company will reimburse such Indemnified Party
for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection
with investigating or defending against any such Loss, action or proceeding;
provided that in any such case the Company shall not be liable to any
particular Indemnified Party to the extent that such Loss (or action or
proceeding in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final prospectus,
summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by such Indemnified Party
specifically for inclusion therein; and provided, further, that the Company
shall not be liable in any such case to the extent it is finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction that any such Loss (or action or proceeding
in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made

(i) in any such preliminary prospectus, if (A) it was the
responsibility of such Indemnified Party to provide the Person
asserting such Loss with a current copy of the prospectus and such
Indemnified Party failed to deliver or cause to be delivered a copy of
the prospectus to such Person after the Company had furnished such
Indemnified Party with a sufficient number of copies of the same prior
to the sale of Registrable Securities to the

16
<PAGE> 19
Person asserting such Loss and (B) the prospectus corrected such untrue
statement or omission; or

(ii) in such prospectus, if such untrue statement or
omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement to such prospectus
and such amendment or supplement has been delivered to the Indemnified
Party prior to the sale of Registrable Securities to the Person
asserting such Loss and the Indemnified Party thereafter fails to
deliver the prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to or
concurrently with such sale after the Company had furnished such
Indemnified Party (in accordance with the notice provisions contained
in Section 10 for Persons who are parties to this Agreement) with a
sufficient number of copies of the same for delivery to purchasers of
securities.

Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive
the transfer of such securities by such Indemnified Party. The Company shall
also indemnify each other Person who participates (including as an underwriter)
in the offering or sale of Registrable Securities hereunder, their officers and
directors and each other Person, if any, who controls any such participating
Person within the meaning of the Securities Act to the same extent as provided
above with respect to Indemnified Parties.

(b) Indemnification by the Sellers. (i) The Company may
require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any
registration statement filed pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3 and as a
condition to indemnifying such sellers pursuant to this Section 2.7, that the
Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from
each prospective seller of such securities, and (ii) each Holder participating
in the Shelf Registration Statement or any replacement Shelf Registration
Statement agrees, to indemnify and hold harmless and reimburse (in the same
manner and to the same extent as set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section
2.7) the Company, each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company,
and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of
the Securities Act, from and against any Losses (or actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arising out of or based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any registration statement under which such securities were
registered under the Securities Act (including all documents incorporated
therein by reference), any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
omission or alleged omission from such registration statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus, or any amendment or
supplement thereto required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, if (but only if) such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by
such prospective seller specifically for inclusion therein; provided, however,
that such prospective seller shall not be obligated to provide such indemnity
to the extent that such Losses result, directly or indirectly, from the failure
of the Company to promptly amend or take action to correct or supplement any
such registration statement, prospectus, amendment or supplement based on
corrected or supplemental information provided in writing by such prospective
seller to the Company expressly for such purpose; and provided further, that
the obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.7(b) shall
be several, and not joint and several, among such indemnifying parties.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.7(b) to the contrary, in no event
shall the liability of any prospective seller under such indemnity be greater
in amount than the amount of the proceeds received by such seller upon the sale
of its Registrable Securities in the offering to which the Losses relate. Such
indemnity shall

17
<PAGE> 20
remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Company or any such director, officer, employee, agent or
participating or controlling Person and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by such prospective seller.

(c) Notices of Claims, etc. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
involving a claim referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.7, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
indemnifying party, give prompt written notice to the latter of the
commencement of such action, provided that the failure of any indemnified party
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of
its obligations under this Section 2.7, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to
give notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the
defense thereof (such assumption to constitute its acknowledgement of its
agreement to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to such matters),
jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that
it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party,
and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party for any legal fees or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that if, in
such indemnified party's reasonable judgment, a conflict of interest between
such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim,
such indemnified party shall be entitled to separate counsel at the expense of
the indemnifying party; and provided, further, that, unless there exists a
conflict of interest among indemnified parties, all indemnified parties in
respect of such claim shall be entitled to only one counsel or firm of counsel
for all such indemnified parties. In the event an indemnifying party shall not
be entitled, or elects not, to assume the defense of a claim, such indemnifying
party shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel or firm of counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying
party in respect of such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any such
indemnified party a conflict of interest exists between such indemnified party
and any other of such indemnified parties in respect of such claim, in which
event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
one additional counsel or firm of counsel for such indemnified parties. No
indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (i) does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to
such indemnified party of a release from all Losses in respect of such claim or
litigation or (ii) would impose injunctive relief on such indemnified party.
No indemnifying party shall be subject to any Losses for any settlement made
without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Other Indemnification. The provisions of this
Section 2.7 shall be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or
contribution which an indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity,
contract or otherwise.

(e) Indemnification Payments. The indemnification
required by this Section 2.7 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount
thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, promptly as and when
bills are received or Losses are incurred.

(f) Contribution. If for any reason the foregoing
indemnity and reimbursement is unavailable or is insufficient to hold harmless
an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) of

18
<PAGE> 21
this Section 2.7, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of any Loss (or actions
or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof),
including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss, action or
proceeding, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the
other. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 2.7(f) to the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the
Company) shall be required pursuant to this Section 2.7(f) to contribute any
amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such
indemnifying party from the sale of Registrable Securities in the offering to
which the Losses of the indemnified parties relate exceeds the amount of any
damages which such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue statement or omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

3. Rule 144 and Rule 144A. (a) The Company will file
the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder and
will take such further action as GPA may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable GPA to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by (i) Rule 144, (ii) Rule 144A or (iii) any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of GPA, the Company
will deliver to GPA a written statement as to whether it has complied with such
requirements and will, at its expense, forthwith upon the request of GPA,
deliver to GPA a certificate, signed by the Company's principal financial
officer, stating (A) the Company's name, address and telephone number
(including area code), (B) the Company's Internal Revenue Service
identification number, (C) the Company's SEC file number, (D) the amount of
shares of each class of capital stock outstanding as shown by the most recent
report or statement published by the Company, and (E) whether the Company has
filed the reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act for a period of
at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of such certificate and in addition
has filed the most recent annual report required to be filed thereunder.

(b) If at any time the Company is not required to file
reports in compliance with either Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, the Company at its expense will, forthwith upon the request of GPA, (i)
make available adequate current public information with respect to the Company
within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 144 and (ii) deliver the
information required by Section (d) of Rule 144A (such information to be
"reasonably current" within the meaning of Section (d)(4)(ii) of Rule 144A).

4. Term. This Agreement shall be effective on the date
hereof and, subject to Section 15 hereof, shall continue in full force and
effect until the eighth (8th) anniversary of the date hereof.

5. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified at any time; provided that each of (i) GPA
(so long as GPA or its Affiliates hold

19
<PAGE> 22
Registrable Securities), (ii) the Holders (which may include GPA) of at least
fifty-one percent (51%) in interest of Registrable Securities, and (iii) the
Company has provided its written consent to such amendment, supplement or
modification. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or
on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any party
of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall
be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same term or condition of this
Agreement on any future occasion.

6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all
prior discussions and agreements between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the sole and entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

7. No Third-Party Beneficiary. The terms and provisions
of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party and their
respective Successors and it is not the intention of the parties to confer
third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person other than (i) any
Affiliate of GPA, (ii) any Holder [of Registrable Securities] entitled to
notice of the registration of securities under this Agreement and (iii) any
Participating Holder entitled to indemnity under Section 2.7.

8. Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or
future law, (i) such provision will be fully severable, (ii) this Agreement
will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (iii) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by
the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom
and (iv) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there
will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and
enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

EXHIBIT 10.12

CODE SHARING AGREEMENT

This Agreement is made this 29th day of June, 1994, by and between
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, INC. ("CAL"), a Delaware corporation, and AMERICA WEST
AIRLINES, INC. ("AWA"), Debtor and Debtor-in-Possession, a Delaware corporation.

RECITALS

CAL and AWA are each certificated air carriers providing air transportation
services in their respective areas of operation.

CAL and AWA desire to cooperate in the coordination of schedules by
allowing AWA to market its flight operations under the CO* designator and CAL to
market its flight operations under the HP* designator.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein contained, CAL and AWA hereby agree as follows:

1. Schedules to be Operated. It is the intent of the parties to share
their two letter designator codes, "CO*" in the case of CAL and "HP*" in the
case of AWA. CAL operated Shared Code Segments (as herein defined) will be
marketed under not only CAL's "CO" designator code but also under AWA's "HP*"
designator code, and AWA operated Shared Code Segments will be marketed under
not only AWA's "HP" designator code, but also under CAL's "CO*" designator code.
Schedule 1 hereto sets forth the flight segments where shared code segments
("Shared Code Segments") will operate at the commencement of this Agreement and
some of the Shared Code Segments that will be operated in the future; however,
it is the intent of the carriers to designate, to the maximum extent permitted
by law, all flights operated by either as Share Code Segments during the term of
this Agreement. The carriers shall meet together every six months that this
Agreement is in effect to discuss the appropriateness of expanding or
contracting the list of city pairs on Schedule 1.

2. Code Sharing Licenses.

(a) CO* License.

(i) Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, CAL hereby grants to AWA a nonexclusive, nontransferable,
revocable license to use the CO* designator code on all of its flights
operated as a Shared Code Segments. (AWA flights flown using the CO*
code are hereinafter referred to as "CO* Flights").

(ii) Control of CO* Flights. AWA shall have sole responsibility
for and control over, and CAL shall have no responsibility for, control
over or obligations or duties with respect to, each and every aspect of
AWA's operations including, without limitation, scheduling (except as
provided in Section 12 hereto), pricing (except as provided in Section
13 hereto), planning of flight itineraries and routings, reservations,
reservations control/yield management, dispatch, fueling, weight and
balance, flight release, maintenance, and flight operations and
compliance with applicable rules and regulations.

(b) HP* License.

(i) Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, AWA hereby grants to CAL a nonexclusive, nontransferable,
revocable license to use the HP* designator code on all of its flights
operated as a Shared Code Segment. (CAL flights flown using the HP* code
are hereinafter referred to as "HP* Flights").

(ii) Control of HP* Flights. CAL shall have sole responsibility
for and control over, and AWA shall have no responsibility for, control
over or obligations or duties with respect to, each and every aspect of
CAL's operations including, without limitation, scheduling (except as
provided in

1
<PAGE> 2

Section 12 hereto), pricing (except as provided in Section 13 hereto),
planning of flight itineraries and routings, reservations,
reservations control/yield management, dispatch, fueling, weight and
balance, flight release, maintenance, and flight operations and
compliance with applicable rules and regulations.

3. Confidential Information. Neither AWA nor CAL shall disclose to the
other carrier or be required to disclose by the other carrier any information
relating to its scheduling (except as provided in Section 12 hereto), pricing,
inventory control or flight profitability. Neither AWA nor CAL shall disclose
the terms of this Agreement or any proprietary information with respect to the
other obtained as a result of this Agreement, either during the term hereof or
thereafter except as may be required by law or by any order of a court or
administrative agency, and then on ten days' notice to the other. The parties
hereto recognize that, in the course of the performance of each of the
provisions hereof, each carrier may be given and may have access to confidential
and proprietary information of the other carrier, including proposed schedule
and fare changes, statistical data regarding loads and fares, sales and
promotional programs and other operating and competitive information
("Confidential Information"). Each carrier shall preserve, and shall ensure that
each of its officers, agents, consultants and employees who receive Confidential
Information preserve, the confidentiality of the other carrier's Confidential
Information.

4. Quality of Service. Each carrier shall perform its service with respect
to its flights operated under the designation of the other carrier in a timely,
expert and quality manner. Each carrier agrees that, in conducting flight
operations under the designator of the other carrier, it will employ prudent
safety and loss prevention policies.

5. Audit.

(a) CAL Audit. CAL shall have the right, at its own cost, to inspect,
review, and observe AWA's operations of CO* Flights, and/or to conduct a
full safety and/or service audit of AWA's operations, manuals and
procedures reasonably related to CO* Flights, at such intervals as CAL
shall reasonably request. In the exercise of such right, CAL does not
undertake any responsibility for the performance of AWA's operations. CAL
shall coordinate its safety and service audits with AWA so as to avoid
disruptions of AWA's operations. Any safety audit may include, without
limitation, maintenance and operation procedures, crew planning,
reservations, passenger and baggage handling, customer service, personnel

records, spare parts, inventory records, training records and manuals,
flight, flight training and operational personnel records. This paragraph
shall not entitle AWA access to CAL's records, documents or systems
relating to its pricing, inventory control or flight profitability.

6. Public Relations. In the event of any irregularity in Shared Code
Segments' operations, including, without limitation, any event causing damage to
persons or property, the operating carrier shall identify itself as being
operated independently of the carrier whose code is being used, and as being
solely responsible for its operations. Either carrier may state that it holds a
code sharing license from the other carrier and that it obtains certain services
from the other carrier if third parties inquire as to such relationship.

7. Irregularities in Operations. AWA shall promptly notify CAL of all
irregularities involving a CO* Flight which result in any damage to persons or
property as soon as such information is available and shall furnish to CAL as
much detail as practicable. CAL shall promptly notify AWA of all irregularities

HP* Flight which result in any damage to persons or property as soon as such
information is available and shall furnish to AWA as much detail as practicable.

8. Reporting Obligation.

(a) Changes in Service. Each carrier shall give the other carrier 60
days advance notice (or notice as far in advance as possible if 60 days is

or (ii) material changes to the manner of conducting its business or the
nature of its product. In the event any such change materially affects the
value or risk to the other carrier of this Code Sharing Agreement in the
other carrier's reasonable judgment, the other carrier shall be entitled to
terminate this agreement if the change is implemented.

(b) Correspondence from Government Authorities. AWA shall immediately
provide CAL copies of any correspondence received from government authority
which, with respect to CO* Flights, references (i) any alleged
noncompliance with rules or regulations affecting air transportation, or
(ii) any investigation of AWA performed or proposed by any government
authority, including, without limitation, any communication issued by a
government authority concerning the airworthiness of AWA's aircraft, the
compliance of AWA's personnel with required operational or training
procedures or any other matter relating to the safe operation of AWA
aircraft.

CAL shall immediately provide AWA copies of any correspondence
received from any government authority which, with respect to HP* Flights,
references (i) any alleged noncompliance with rules or regulations
affecting air transportation, or (ii) any investigation of CAL performed or
proposed by any government authority, including, without limitation, any
communication issued by a government authority concerning the airworthiness
of CAL's aircraft, the compliance of CAL's personnel with required
operational or training procedures or any other matter relating to the safe
operation of CAL aircraft.

(c) Notice of Complaints. AWA shall monthly furnish CAL a summary of
complaints, notices or violation, request to cease activity or similar
correspondence which reasonably relate to CO* Flights and which are
received by AWA from passengers, any government authority, or other
parties. CAL shall monthly furnish AWA a summary of complaints, notices or
violation, request to cease activity or similar correspondence which
reasonably relate to HP* Flights and which are received by CAL from
passengers, any government authority, or other parties. Each carrier shall
comply with the other carrier's reasonable requests for actual copies of
any such documents.

9. Flight Display.

(a) All Shared Code Segments will be included in the availability and
fare displays of all computerized reservations systems in which CAL and AWA
participate, the Official Airline Guide (to the extent agreed upon) and
CAL's and AWA's internal reservation systems, under the shared code as well
as the operator's own code, to the extent possible. CAL and AWA will take
the appropriate measures necessary to ensure the display of Shared Code
Segments in accordance with the preceding sentence.

(b) CAL and AWA will disclose and identify the Shared Code Segments to
the public as actually being a flight of and operated by the operating
carrier, in at least the following ways:

(i) a symbol will be used in timetables and computer reservation
system indicating that Shared Code Segments are actually operated by the
other carrier;

(ii) to the extent reasonable, messages on airport flight
information displays will identify the operator of flights shown as
Shared Code Segments;

(iii) CAL and AWA advertising concerning Shared Code Segments and
CAL and AWA reservationists will disclose the operator of each flight;
and

(iv) in any other manner prescribed by law.

<PAGE> 4

10. Terms and Conditions of Carriage and Claims Procedures.

(a) In all cases the contract of carriage between a passenger and a
carrier will be that of the carrier whose designator code is used and not
that of the carrier operating the Shared Code Flight.

(b) The carriers will use existing IATA procedures when handling and
settling claims made by customers in connection with Shared Code Segments.

11. Irregularity Handling.

(a) In the event of flight delays, cancellations or other schedule
irregularities that affect Shared Code Segments, the operating carrier will
inform the carrier whose designator is also used of all pertinent
information concerning an irregularity for customer information purposes.

(b) The parties agree that they will cooperate in all available ways
to accommodate passengers experiencing flight irregularities and that
neither will forbear from providing such assistance because the other may
have been responsible for the flight irregularity. In the event of a flight
irregularity, the carrier causing or experiencing the irregularity shall
bear all related costs associated with accommodating the passengers who
have been delayed. The carriers will review existing procedures for
accommodating interline passengers with respect to flight irregularities
and oversales to determine their adequacy for the purposes of this
Agreement and will make such adjustments in existing procedures as they
find necessary or appropriate.

12. Airport Operational Assistance. CAL and AWA will cooperate to
coordinate and maintain their schedules to minimize the waiting time and to
maximize convenience of passengers who are connecting from a CAL to AWA flight
segment (or vice versa). Each carrier will provide the other with the airport
operational assistance that is required to assure schedule compatibility for
Shared Code Segments for which a Through Fare (as such term is hereinafter
defined) may be applicable. The carriers will use their respective best efforts
to align gates and ticket counter space where Shared Code Segments operate.

13. Pricing and Capacity Control of Shared Code Segments.

[CONFIDENTIAL PORTION DELETED]

15. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. CAL and AWA each represent,
warrant, and agree that performance of its respective obligations under this
Agreement shall be conducted and all of its personnel shall at all times meet,

applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations, and satisfy all applicable
insurance requirements, whether in effect or hereafter promulgated of the United
States National Transportation Safety Board, Department of Transportation of
Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Defense of any country or
territory with jurisdiction over the Shared Code Segments.

16. Independent Parties.

(a) Independent Contractors. It is expressly recognized and agreed
that each carrier, in its performance and otherwise under this Agreement,

with its obligations under this Agreement. Neither CAL nor AWA nor any
officer, employee, representative, or agent of CAL or AWA shall in any
manner, directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, be deemed to
be, or make any representation or take any action which may give rise to
the existence of, any employment, agent, partnership, or other like
relationship as between CAL and AWA but each carrier's relationship as
respects the other carrier in connection with this Agreement is and shall
remain that of an independent contractor.

and for the payment of all taxes, contributions or other payments for
unemployment compensation, vacations, or old age benefits, pensions and all
other benefits now or hereafter imposed upon employers with respect to its
employees by any government or agency thereof or any other party (whether
measured by the wages, salaries, compensation or other remuneration paid to
such employees or otherwise) and each carrier further agrees to make such
payments and to make and file all reports and returns, and to do everything
necessary to comply with the laws imposing such taxes, contributions or
other payments.

RECIPROCAL FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT

This Agreement is made this 25th day of August, 1994, by and between
Continental Airlines, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CAL"), and America West
Airlines, Inc., Debtor and Debtor-in-Possession, a Delaware corporation ("AWA").

RECITALS

CAL and AWA are each certificated air carriers providing air transportation
services in their respective areas of operation.

CAL and AWA have entered into a "Code Sharing Agreement" whereby CAL will
market its flight operations under the HP* designator code and AWA will market
its flight operations under the CO* designator code.

CAL and AWA each maintain frequent flyer programs, "OnePass" in the case
of CAL and "FlightFund" in the case of AWA, whereby members of such programs
earn reward miles for miles flown on the airlines participating in the program
that may be redeemed for various travel related awards.

CAL and AWA desire to allow members of their respective frequent flyer
programs ("OP Members" in the case of CAL and "FF Members" in the case of AWA)
to earn miles in their respective programs when members travel on flights
operated by the other carrier that are utilizing its designator code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein contained, CAL and AWA hereby agree as follows:

1. Mileage Accrual. CAL and AWA will permit OP Members to accrue the
greater of [Confidential Portion Deleted] miles or the number of actual miles
flown in OnePass for travel on flights that are designated as CO* Flights (as
such term is defined in the Code Sharing Agreement) in the same manner as OP
Members accrue miles in OnePass on CAL operated flights utilizing the CO
designator code. AWA and CAL will permit FF Members to accrue the greater of
[Confidential Portion Deleted] miles or the number of actual miles flown in
FlightFund for travel on flights that are designated as HP* Flights (as such
term is defined in the Code Sharing Agreement) in the same manner as FF Members
accrue miles in FlightFund on AWA operated flights utilizing the HP designator
code.

1
<PAGE> 25

2. RECORDING OF MILEAGE CREDIT.

a. AWA shall require each OP Member who desires to accrue mileage in
OnePass and is traveling on a flight designated as a CO* Flight to submit a
OnePass identification card (or such other indicia of membership as CAL may
advise) prior to boarding any flight designated as a CO* Flight. CAL shall
require each FF Member who desires to accrue mileage in FlightFund and is
traveling on a flight designated as an HP* Flight to submit a FlightFund
identification card (or such other indicia of membership as AWA may advise)
prior to boarding any flight designated as an HP* Flight.

b. Each carrier shall transmit to the other carrier by computer tape, or by
means of data transmission (modem), all pertinent data necessary to enable each
carrier to credit mileage. Each carrier shall provide this data in a format
compatible with the other carrier's computer systems and upon receipt of such
data shall credit the members' account. Data to be provided shall include member
name and identification number, carrier code, date of travel, flight number,
city pair and class of service booked and flown. The tape with this information
will be delivered or transmitted daily as noted below:

HP* activity tapes to:

America West Airlines
1930 West University, 52N-ISD
Tempe, Arizona 85281
Attn: Tape Librarian

CO* activity tapes to:

Electronic Data Systems
Tape Librarian
9014 Research Drive
Charlotte, North Carolina 28262

If transmissions are via modem, carriers will establish mutually agreeable
procedures.

c. Individuals who are members of the frequent flyer programs of both
carriers will not be permitted to accrue miles in both programs for travel on
the same flight. Such members shall only be permitted to accrue miles in the
program of the carrier of their election.

2
<PAGE> 26

d. Miles earned by members for flights on Shared Code Segments will be
treated by each carrier in the same manner as any other miles earned or redeemed
in such carrier's program.

3. MILEAGE CHARGE, PAYMENT AND RECONCILIATION.

a. Mileage Charge. AWA will pay to CAL, in accordance with 3.b. below, an
amount equal to the number of actual miles flown by OP Members electing to
receive OnePass miles on flights designated as CO* Flights, multiplied by
$[Confidential Portion Deleted]. CAL will pay, in accordance with 3.b. below, to
AWA an amount equal to the number of actual miles flown by FF Members electing
to receive FlightFund miles on flights designated as HP* Flights, multiplied by
$[Confidential Portion Deleted].

b. Payment. Beginning the first full month that this Agreement is in
effect, and each month thereafter, each carrier will pay the other carrier,
through the Airline Clearing House, the amount due pursuant to 3.a. above for
actual miles flown during the previous month. Neither carrier will invoice the
other carrier for miles until after such time as the miles have been actually
posted.

c. In no case will either carrier be required to pay the other carrier,
pursuant to Section 3.b., more than $500,000 during any calendar year, provided
that if a carrier is owed more than $500,000 during a calendar year and the
other carrier does not pay the carrier an amount equal to the deficiency within
30 days of demand thereof, the carrier that is owed money may terminate this
Agreement by providing the other carrier with 120 days notice of such
termination.

d. Each carrier will provide a monthly report to the other carrier which
tracks the number of miles posted to its members' accounts for activity related
to Shared Code Segments. This report will contain the number of (i) actual and
bonus miles posted (e.g. minimum miles, class of service, double miles, elite
member bonuses, etc.), (ii) city pair, (iii) ticket booking code (Y, F, Q,
etc.), (iv) miles rejected, and (v) retroactive mileage credited. Additionally,
a printout of rejected and retroactively credited transactions will accompany
this report. Such report shall be furnished 30 days after the end of the monthly
period for which such report relates.

e. Requests by members of either carrier's frequent flyer program made
after the date of travel for mileage on Shared Code Segments during the most
recent six (6) month period will be processed by the Service Center of the
carrier that operates the frequent flyer program in which the member seeks to
accrue miles on an on-going basis. The number of retroactive requests that are
credited will be processed by each carrier on a weekly basis. Miles will be
added retroactively only when a copy of the ticket and original boarding pass
or ticket jacket is received by the Service Center. Such documents will be
maintained for one (1) year so that each carrier has the ability to audit them
at its reasonable request.

3
<PAGE> 27

f. In the event that an original boarding pass or ticket jacket is not
provided, retroactive credit will only be credited after a member's request is
reviewed by both carriers and procedural steps have been taken to ensure that a
member does not receive credit for a single transaction in both programs.

4. MILEAGE REDEMPTION.

[Confidential Portion Deleted]

5. REWARD TRAVEL CHARGES, PAYMENT AND RECONCILIATION.

a. Reward Travel Charge. [Confidential Portion Deleted]

for reward travel during the previous month.

c. Reward Travel Reconciliation. Each carrier will comply with the ticket
reconciliation and accounting procedures set forth in Exhibit C hereto.

6. PROGRAM RULES.

a. CAL's obligation to provide OnePass miles to OP Members is subject to
the OP Members' compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
OnePass Members' Guide, as such may be amended and supplemented by CAL from time
to time. AWA's obligation to provide FlightFund miles to FF Members and to
permit FF Members to redeem FlightFund miles for reward travel on flights
operated by CAL is subject to the FF Members' compliance with the terms and
conditions set forth in the FlightFund Members' Guide, as such may be amended
and supplemented by AWA from time to time.

b. Each carrier will seek written approval from the other carrier of
substantial changes to program rules, award levels and copy that affect the
other carrier. Neither carrier will unreasonably withhold its approval or
substantive comments as to the sufficiency of any advertising copy of the other.

4
<PAGE> 28

7. Advertising and Promotional Efforts. During the term of this Agreement,
and at no cost to the other carrier, either carrier, on a periodic basis, may
actively promote its participation in the other carrier's frequent flyer
program.

a. The carriers may choose to advertise such participation in various
media, which may include, but not be limited to, print, radio, television
and member communications.

b. All copy generated must receive prior written approval by the carrier's
designee.

c. It is agreed that any advertising or promotion which contains any
trademark, service mark or copyright of either carrier will be appropriately
identified as a registered trademark, service mark or copyright.

d. Direct access to and use of either carrier's membership name lists,
including preferred status members, for cross marketing purposes outside of the
usual program communications, are subject to further discussion and are not a
part of this Agreement.

e. The carriers agree to meet and discuss short and long term marketing
plans.

8. Additional Frequency Marketing Opportunities.

a. CAL and AWA agree that this travel relationship is not an exclusive
Agreement. Therefore, each carrier, at its discretion, may maintain and promote
other airline relationships through its frequent flyer program.

b. While this Agreement addresses the terms and conditions for
participation in each carrier's frequent flyer program, both carriers agree to
explore other joint possibilities of developing and implementing additional
marketing relationships, programs and strategies designed to create incremental
demand for each carrier's products and services. Separate fees may be required
for such participation and will not conflict in any way with this Agreement or
the Code Sharing Agreement between both carriers.

9. Continuation of Programs. Nothing herein contained shall obligate
either carrier to continue operation of its frequent flyer program and either
carrier may terminate its program without penalty by providing the other carrier
with 180 days' advance notice of such program termination.

5
<PAGE> 29

10. Program Administration and Reward Ticket Issuance.

a. Each carrier shall administer its frequent flyer program and all rules
and regulations that apply to its members. Reward ticket issuance procedures
will be mutually agreed upon by both carriers.

b. Each carrier reserves the right to alter its frequent flyer program at
any time and in any manner consistent with this Agreement, but shall not 
modify or amend the mileage accrual or reward levels which affect the other 
carrier without advance notice.

c. Each carrier will be responsible for communicating directly with its
frequent flyer members to resolve problems regarding reward travel on the other
carrier. However, the carriers will cooperate to the extent reasonable and
necessary to resolve any customer service issues involving reward travel.

d. Both carriers will take prompt and reasonable steps to train their
customer service and accounting personnel regarding the other carrier's program.
This training will include how to: capture and track transactions, issue reward
tickets for travel on the other carrier, refer a passenger regarding specific
program information and execute any other customer service that supports the
frequent flyer programs. This training will include initial as well as recurrent
efforts to ensure administrative efficiency.

11. Future Review

a. The carriers will meet on an annual basis and review the charges
hereunder for redeemed and accrued miles to determine whether the charges should
be adjusted or not. In addition, if the frequent flyer program of either carrier
changes such that the charges hereunder do not produce the results contemplated
herein, the carriers, upon request by the carrier operating the unchanged
program, will meet to determine whether the charges should be adjusted or not.
If, pursuant to meetings held pursuant to this Section it is determined that
adjustment of the charges is necessary, the carriers shall negotiate in good
faith to determine what charges are unable to agree on appropriate charges, the
dispute will be submitted to a committee consisting of an equal number of
members of each carrier's senior management for final resolution.

b. If, during the first 90 days after program members are able to accrue or
redeem miles pursuant this Agreement, either carrier receives a significant
number of complaints from its frequent flyer program members concerning its
participation in this Agreement, then, upon written notice from the carrier
receiving

6
<PAGE> 30

the complaints within 30 days after the end of such 90 day period, the 
carriers will meet to discuss the action that must be taken in order to 
correct the problem(s) that gives rise to the complaints. If the carriers 
are unable to agree on a solution, the carriers will submit the dispute
to a committee consisting of an equal number of members of each carrier's 
senior management for final resolution.

12. INDEPENDENT PARTIES. It is expressly recognized and agreed that each
carrier, in its performance and otherwise under this Agreement, is and shall be
engaged and acting as an independent contractor and in its own independent and
separate business; that each carrier shall retain complete and exclusive control
over its staff and operations and the conduct of its business; and that each
carrier shall bear and pay all expenses, costs, risks and responsibilities
incurred by it in connection with its obligations under this Agreement. Neither
CAL nor AWA nor any officer, employee, representative, or agent of CAL or AWA
shall in any manner, directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, be
deemed to be, or make any representation or take any action which may give rise
to the existence of, any employment, agent, partnership, of other like
relationship as between CAL and AWA but each carrier's relationship as respects

Continental Airlines, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CAL"), and America
West Airlines, Inc., Debtor and Debtor-in-Possession, a Delaware corporation
("AWA").

RECITALS

CAL and AWA are each certificated air carriers providing air transportation
services in their respective areas of operation.

CAL and AWA are each capable of providing various ground handling services,
including customer service, ramp service line maintenance, maintenance of ground
support equipment and aircraft cleaning, and have the facilities and equipment
necessary to perform such services (collectively, the "Services") at airports
where they operate.

CAL and AWA each desire to consolidate various ground handling services,
facilities and equipment at airports where both airlines operate in order to

determine what Services will be provided by one airline for the other airline at
locations where both airlines conduct air carrier operations. The locations
where both airlines conduct operations are set forth in Exhibit A hereto. The
factors that will be considered in determining which airline provides Services
at a particular location will be the number of flights that each airline
operates at the location, the overall savings that may be realized, the presence
of third party constraints, the number of locations that an airline provides or
is likely to provide Services for the other airline, and any legitimate business
concerns. The Services to be provided at each location shall be described
according to Annex A of the SGHA of April 1993, and attached hereto as

for such Carrier supplied ground equipment in accordance with section 3.c(2)
hereof. Such Carrier supplied ground equipment shall at all times be considered

Agreement immediately and exercise such other remedies as may be available at

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
CONCERNING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS
BETWEEN
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, INC. ("CONTINENTAL")
AND AMERICA WEST AIRLINES, INC. ("AMERICA WEST")

1. PURPOSE:

The airline industry is heavily dependent on data processing technology and
the carriers must constantly refresh and update their automation base and
capabilities. Accordingly, Continental and America West expect to make
significant investments from time to time in application software development,
new technology services, and new technology implementation. Continental and
America West wish to take advantage of opportunities to co-fund the development
of new software applications. This Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") is
intended to provide a conceptual foundation upon which the parties may agree to
jointly share in the development costs of new software applications or other
synergistic opportunities common to both in data processing technology.

2. SCOPE AND INTENT:

For purposes of this MOU, the term "Technology" shall mean applications
software and hardware, and/or telecommunications and other systems services,
and all documentation relating thereto. However, the term "Technology" shall
not include the CRS software or documentation or any other software or
documentation owned exclusively by System One or marketed by the Airline
Products and Services Division of EDS. Continental and America West each
understand and intend to make their technology available to the other party to
the extent contractually and legally permissible. Each party understands it
will be necessary to cooperate to achieve cost savings for future software
development and to realize operational synergies between both organizations.
All technology transfers shall be in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions to be specified for each technology transfer project.

1
<PAGE> 83

3. PROCEDURES:

Within ninety (90) days from the Effective Date, the parties will begin
substantive discussions to (i) develop a formal process for evaluating projects,
(ii) develop a mechanism to develop a procedure to track Technology transfers
and (iii) develop guidelines to identify the benefits that may be realized by
each of the parties from the cooperative exchange of technology.

Status Reviews. Each party shall designate an individual as a
representative to meet on no less than a semi-annual basis to (i) review the
status of ongoing projects, (ii) identify objectives for joint development
projects.

Specific Technology licensing and joint development efforts will be
documented and the exchange of information will be pursuant to a master
technology transfer and licensing agreement, the form of which shall be agreed
upon by the parties.

4. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER:

The party obtaining Technology ("Recipient") shall be responsible for all
costs of implementation of the technology in its organization. The party
providing the technology ("Provider") shall grant such licenses that are
reasonably commercially appropriate.

Each project pursuant to which one party licenses technology to the other
party shall include, without limitation, specific terms with respect to (i)
Technology to be licensed, (ii) deliverables, (iii) tasks to be performed by
each party and, (iv) approximate schedule for completion of each task and the
transfer process, (v) estimated out-of-pocket expenses to be paid by the
receiving party.

2

<PAGE> 84

In the event that the Technology to be transferred or any part of the
Technology is third party software, the party providing such software shall be
under no obligation to make such Technology available to the receiving party
without obtaining the third party's permission for such transfer. The receiving
party shall be solely responsible for obtaining all necessary rights from such
third party and shall be solely responsible for all cost related thereto. The
providing party, upon request of the receiving party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain said permission from the third party, but shall not
be required to incur any out of pocket expenses to do so. In the event that the
receiving party is unable to obtain the necessary rights from the third party,
the providing party will be under no further obligation with respect to such
Technology.

5. DEVELOPMENT:

In the event a party is planning a stand-alone information systems
development project estimated to cost more than $200,000.00 the planning party
will notify the other party. The parties will undertake to determine whether a
joint development activity would be beneficial to both parties. If a joint
development project is determined to be beneficial, the parties will enter good
faith negotiations leading to an agreement to proceed jointly with the project.
If the parties cannot reach an agreement to jointly develop the project, that
decision shall be documented with defined reasons for the decision and signed by
both parties.

Each development project to which the parties agree shall include, without
limitation, specific terms with respect to (i) description of the software to be
developed, (ii) the deliverables, (iii) the tasks to be performed by each party,
(iv) the projected time schedule for completing each task and project, (v)
resources each party will provide, and (vi) costs of which each party will be
responsible.

3
<PAGE> 85

6. SYNERGY BENEFITS:

The parties understand that the goal for both parties is to identify
Technology transfers that will synergistically benefit both parties. The synergy
benefits need not be equal for both parties. The parties shall determine such
synergy benefits as follows:

Technology Transfer Benefits. The primary benefit to the receiving party
from a Technology transfer shall be the difference between the fair market value
of the Technology transferred and the costs incurred by the receiving party. The
fair market value shall be the lesser of the cost of acquiring similar
technology from a third party and the cost of developing similar technology
internally. The secondary benefit to the receiving party shall be the reduction
in implementation costs and time resulting from the existence of an operational
technology and the use of existing training materials, cut-over strategies or
test systems. This secondary benefit shall be determined by evaluating the time
and implementation cost savings, if any, and the benefits associated with the
implementation of the Technology as are identified in the business justification
supporting such implementation.

Joint Development Benefits. In the event the parties mutually agree to
carry out joint development projects, the synergy benefit to either party shall
be the difference between that party's portion of the shared costs and the costs
which would have been incurred by that party had that party undertaken the
development on a stand-along basis.

Annual Benefits Determination. At the end of each calendar year, the 
senior information technology executives of both parties or their designated
representatives, shall jointly quantify the synergy benefits to each party for
that year.

<PAGE> 86

7. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:

The parties hereto understand that the Technology of each will be
considered confidential information proprietary to the party supplying the
information. All information deemed proprietary by the supplying party shall be
marked "Confidential and Proprietary" to place the receiving party on notice as
to the nature of the information. Any information provided by the supplying
party marked confidential and proprietary shall not be deemed confidential
information should that information (i) be lawfully in the public domain, (ii)
generally known and disclosed to the receiving party, lawfully by a third party,
(iii) be lawfully in the receiving party's possession prior to the receiving
party's receipt of the information pursuant to this agreement, or (iv)
independently developed by the receiving party and such independent development
is factually documented.

Confidentiality. Each party will safeguard the proprietary and
confidential materials supplied to it by the other party to the same degree and
extent that the party safeguards its own proprietary and confidential
information of the same or similar nature. Confidential and Proprietary
information received by a party shall not be disclosed to any third party
without the prior consent of the party providing the Confidential and
Proprietary information. The party receiving the Confidential and Proprietary
information will disseminate the information only to those employees who have
the need to know the contents of such information to discharge their employment
duties.

Non-Disclosure Agreements. Each party acknowledges that Confidential and
Proprietary information will be exchanged pursuant to Technology transfer
projects between the parties. The transfer of confidential information on each
project shall be pursuant to a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, the
terms of which shall be agreed upon by the parties.

Contractor's scheduled flights operated pursuant to this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Contractor desires to operate, and AWA is willing to contract for,

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in the consideration of the foregoing premises and

thereof, Contractor shall schedule and operate, subject to Paragraph 2.01(c)
below, AMERICA WEST EXPRESS service in the following markets:

</TABLE>

(b) All published schedules to be operated by Contractor pursuant to
Section 2.01(a) above or to add new markets other than those listed in Section
2.01(a) above must be submitted to AWA at least 30 days prior to the effective
date of such schedule. Contractor agrees that in the development of its
schedules, it shall consult with AWA and use its best reasonable efforts to
ensure that the primary needs of both local and connecting traffic in AWA
markets are being met. AWA shall not have the right to approve or disapprove
such schedules. AWA retains the right to withhold the use of its code, logo or
trademarks from any flight operated by the Contractor. AWA shall timely file
Contractor's code-shared schedules with its own schedules in accordance with
industry standards provided Contractor's schedules are timely received by AWA.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2.01, Contractor shall be entitled to operate additional services under its own
name in the markets covered by this Agreement; provided that any aircraft used
in providing such services shall not bear AWA's logo or markings.

(d) Contractor shall be the sole and exclusive air carrier authorized by
AWA to operate as AMERICA WEST EXPRESS (or operate by similar AWA turbo-prop
feeder-operation-designation) for all AMERICA WEST EXPRESS flights serving the
Phoenix hub. In consideration of their exclusive air carrier status, Contractor
shall have a right of first refusal to institute any new services (cities or
flights) which are forecast by AWA to be profitable. Such services shall be
inaugurated within 90 days of recommendation by AWA. If Contractor refuses to
provide the requested service, AWA shall have the right to contract with another
carrier to operate that route as an AMERICA WEST EXPRESS, provided that the
service shall be the same as that proposed to Contractor. Contractor shall have
the right of first refusal to provide service to any additional major cities or
hubs wherein AWA may desire to establish a code-sharing agreement. Contractor
shall have 30 days from the time it is offered the additional agreement to
accept or decline such opportunity. If accepted, Contractor shall have 120 days
to prepare itself to fulfill its obligations at the additional city or hub.

(e) Contractor may withdraw from, reduce service, or suspend service in any
of its AMERICA WEST EXPRESS markets listed in Section 2.01(a) after

[CONFIDENTIAL PORTION DELETED]

Contractor shall then give 30 days' notice to AWA of its desire to affect
service to that market.

<PAGE> 4

(f) Inauguration of services listed in Section 2.01(a) will be accomplished
according to the transition schedule contained in Exhibit A, made a part of this
agreement and attached hereto.

Section 2.02 Aircraft To Be Used

(a) Contractor will provide the scheduled air services described in Section
2.01 with short-to-medium range, multi-engine, turbine-propeller aircraft. Such
aircraft shall have a minimum of 19 seats and appropriate capacity for passenger
baggage, freight and mail.

(b) Upon filing a Plan of Reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court,
Contractor shall begin to repaint its aircraft used in connection with the
services provided under this Agreement with exterior color decor and Trademarks
to be designed by AWA in consultation with Contractor. The Contractor shall
provide the paint and other materials for the exterior aircraft decor and AWA
shall paint the aircraft in its painting facility. Any change to the exterior
color decor and pattern of the aircraft subsequent to the original design shall
be made at the expense of AWA. AWA understands that the flowage of Contractor's
aircraft prevents Contractor from painting all of its aircraft in AWA colors.
Contractor will attempt to maximize the utilization of AWA painted aircraft on
code-shared routes. AWA understands that on occasion an AWA-colored aircraft may
be used in Contractor's "Mesa" system due to aircraft flowage requirements.

In addition to the use of the AWA Trademarks on its aircraft, Contractor
shall use and display a suitable sign on the exterior of its aircraft
identifying Contractor as the operator of the services being provided pursuant
to this Agreement. The use and display of such sign shall be in compliance with
any applicable FAA rule or directive, shall be visible to passengers approaching
the aircraft for boarding and shall be subject to the prior written approval of
AWA as to its nature, size and location on Contractor's aircraft.

Section 2.03 Flight Crews To Be Used

All services performed by Contractor pursuant to this Agreement shall be
operated with crews consisting of a captain or pilot, and a first officer or
co-pilot. All such crew members shall at all times meet all currently applicable
governmental requirements, as such requirements may be amended from time to time
during the life of this Agreement, and shall be fully licensed and qualified for
the services to be performed hereunder.

non-discriminatory basis in accordance with AWA's established methods and
procedures. For passengers originating their travel at points other than those

systems of other airlines, connecting reservations to the services of Contractor
will also be made on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with currently
established industry methods and procedures. In all cases, AWA will confirm the
reservations of Contractor's passengers through the entire itinerary of their
scheduled trips. When a contact number is supplied by the passengers making such
reservations, AWA will assume the responsibility of notifying passengers of any
changes in Contractor's schedules or operations, provided that Contractor
furnishes AWA with sufficient advance notice of such changes. Contractor will
provide AWA with parameters of Contractor's flight capacity and discount seat
inventory levels and AWA will use its best efforts to accommodate Contractor's
directions as to these levels.

in no event later than the 28th day of month following the month in which
services were provided. In the event Contractor fails to pay AWA in full all
Service Charges payable hereunder when due, Contractor agrees to pay to AWA, in
addition to such Service Charges, interest on the unpaid balance of such Service
Charges computed at the rate per annum of one percent (1%) plus the prime rate
which the Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association) from time to time charges
at its principal office in New York on short-term loans to large businesses with
the highest credit standing, with a minimum rate per annum of 10 percent, from
the due date thereof to the date of payment. It is hereby mutually agreed and
understood by the parties hereto that the aforesaid Service Charges

[CONFIDENTIAL PORTION DELETED]

AWA will use only the personnel in its employ and the equipment and facilities
which it owns or leases. In the event AWA is required to employ, retain or
otherwise furnish additional personnel or obtain, by purchase,

<PAGE> 11

lease or otherwise any additional facilities or equipment, or incur in any
manner whatsoever any expenses or disbursements in connection with its
performance of this Agreement in excess of the personnel, facilities or
equipment being provided in the normal course of business, Contractor shall
reimburse AWA in full, through the Clearing House for the actual costs of such
additional personnel, facilities and/or equipment, and for any actual expenses
or disbursements incurred by AWA in connection with its performance under this
Agreement; provided that, prior to incurring any such additional costs or
expenses or making any such disbursements, AWA shall first obtain a written
approval therefor from Contractor.

(b) All payments and/or reimbursements contemplated in this Article shall
be deemed to be in addition to and not in lieu of any other payments and/or
reimbursements required of either party hereto by other articles of this
Agreement.

Section 8.02 Records and Reports

(a) Upon either party's request, and until such time as the party advises
the other that such reports are no longer necessary, each party shall furnish to
the requesting party, within 60 days following the close of the first three
fiscal quarters of the party, unaudited financial statements including the
party's current corporate balance sheets and profit and loss statements, and
within 120 days after the close of its fiscal year, each party shall furnish the
other with audited financial statements of such party (or its parent company)
including, either separately or on a consolidated basis, the balance sheet and
profit and loss statements of that party. The appropriate reports filed on Form
10-Q or 10-K shall be satisfactory to fulfill such obligation.

(b) Each party shall also promptly furnish the other with a copy of every
report that it prepares and is required to submit to the FAA, National
Transportation Safety Board ("NTSB") or any other governmental agency, relating
to any accident or incident involving an aircraft used by it in performing
services under this Agreement, when such accident or incident is claimed to have
resulted in the death of or substantial injury to any person or the loss of,
damage to, or destruction of any property.

(c) Each party shall promptly notify the other in writing of (i) any change
in or relinquishment of control of it, (ii) any agreement contemplating such a
change or relinquishment with a copy of such agreement, if in writing, to the
other party, or (iii) any change or contemplated change in the Chief Executive
Officer position of it.

ARTICLE 9 -- EFFECTIVE DATE, TERMINATION AND CANCELLATION

Section 9.01 Effective Date and Term

(a) This Agreement will become effective on October 1, 1992 and will
continue in effect thereafter for a period of ten years, unless it is terminated
at an earlier date pursuant to one or more of the provisions of this Article 9.
The AMERICA WEST EXPRESS service described in Section 2 shall commence on the
dates specified in Section 2 and the applicable reservations and ticketing
services shall be made available 30 days in advance of the start of such
services.

(b) In the event there is any change in the statutes governing the economic
regulation of air transportation, or in the applicable rules, regulations or
order of the DOT or some successor agency or department of the government having
jurisdiction over air transportation which change or changes materially affect
the rights and/or obligations presently in force with respect to the air
transportation services of AWA or Contractor, or both, then the parties hereto
will consult, within 30 days after any of the occurrences described herein, in
order to determine what, if any, changes to this Agreement are necessary or
appropriate, including but not limited to, the early termination and
cancellation of this Agreement. If the parties hereto are unable to agree
whether any change or changes to this Agreement are necessary and proper, or as
to the terms of such changes, or whether this Agreement should be cancelled in
light of the occurrences described above, and such failure to reach agreement
shall continue for a period of 30 days following the commencement of the
consultations provided for by this Section 9.01(c), then this Agreement may be
cancelled by either AWA or Contractor upon providing the other party a minimum
of 90 days' written notice of such cancellation.

10
<PAGE> 12

Section 9.02 Termination

(a) In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Article, this Agreement
may be cancelled or terminated by either AWA or Contractor if there is an
assignment of this Agreement or any of its rights, duties or obligations created
hereunder with respect to any party to this Agreement without the written
consent of the other party. In the event that this Agreement is assigned,
whether by operation of law or otherwise, without such consent having been given
in writing, the party not making the assignment shall have the right immediately
to terminate the Agreement by telegraphic or written notice to the other party.
If AWA merges, combines or consolidated with another carrier, or if
substantially all of AWA's assets are acquired by another carrier and the "HP"
designator code or the AMERICA WEST EXPRESS will thereafter not be used for the
services of AWA or such other carrier at the Hub, Contractor shall have the
right to use, in accordance with this Agreement, such replacement or substitute
designator code and related trademarks as are utilized by AWA or such other
acquiring or new carrier for its primary services at the Hub. A merger,
combination, or consolidation by or with another person, company or corporation
by Contractor shall be considered an assignment by Contractor; provided,
however, a merger, combination, or consolidation by or with a subsidiary or
affiliate of Contractor or with another corporation in which Contractor is the
surviving corporation and in which there is no substantial change in the
ownership or control of Contractor shall not be considered an assignment by
Contractor.

(b) Recognizing that AWA is presently operating as a Chapter 11 company,
under reorganization, in the event that Contractor shall file a voluntary
petition in bankruptcy or that proceedings in bankruptcy shall be instituted
against it and such party shall be adjudged bankrupt, or that a court shall take
jurisdiction of such party and its assets pursuant to proceedings brought under
the provisions of any federal reorganization act, or that a receiver of such
party's assets shall be appointed and such taking or appointment shall not be
stayed or vacated within a period of 60 days, or if AWA should change to a
Chapter 7 proceeding or re-enter bankruptcy after its discharge from its current
bankruptcy, the other party may thereupon terminate this Agreement by 15 or more
days' prior written notice to the other party.

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, if either party shall fail to
perform, keep, and observe any of the terms, covenants or conditions herein
contained on the part of such party to be performed, kept or observed, the
non-breaching party may give the breaching party notice in writing to correct
such condition or cure such default and, if any such condition or default shall
continue for 30 days after the receipt of such notice by the breaching party
and, if within such period of time the breaching party has not prosecuted with
diligence the correction of such condition or default, the non-breaching party
may then terminate this Agreement upon 15 or more days' prior written notice,
and this Agreement shall thereupon cease and expire at the end of such 15 or
more days in the same manner and to the same effect as if it were the expiration
of the original term.

(d) If either party is required by the FAA or DOT to suspend a substantial
portion of its operations for any safety reason, and has not resumed a major
portion of such operations hereunder within 30 days of suspension, the other
party may terminate this Agreement upon five or more days' prior written notice.

(e) AWA, in addition to the other provisions of this section and Section
9.01 above, may terminate this Agreement upon not less than 30 days' written
notice to the other party hereto should any one of the following conditions
occur during the time this Agreement is in effect:

(1) if, during any two consecutive calendar months during the life of
this Agreement, Contractor's flight completion factor shall fall below 97%
due to cancellations attributable to maintenance or operational
deficiencies within Contractor's normal management control;

(2) if, for any two consecutive calendar months during the life of
this Agreement, Contractor's on-time performance falls below the lower of
either: a.) 75 percent of arrivals within 15 minutes; or b.) AWA's actual
on-time performance during the same period;

(3) if, Contractor fails to comply with the trademark license
provisions of Article 11 of this Agreement;

11
<PAGE> 13

(f) Either AWA or Contractor may terminate this Agreement without cause at
any time after the third year from the effective date hereof upon 180 days'
written notice to the other party.

(g) Any early termination or cancellation of one or more of the provisions
of this Article 9 shall not be construed so as to relieve any party hereto of
any debts or monetary obligations to the other party that shall have accrued
hereunder prior to the effective date of such termination or cancellation.

Section 9.03 Force Majeure

Neither AWA nor Contractor shall be liable for any failure to perform under
this Agreement if such failure is due to causes beyond its control, including,
but not limited to, acts of God or the public enemy, fire, floods, epidemics,
quarantine or strikes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to
the obligations described under Article 7 of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10 -- USE OF CONTRACTOR'S AIRCRAFT

In the event that aircraft owned and/or operated by Contractor bearing the
AMERICA WEST EXPRESS are available and can be utilized without adversely
affecting in any manner the regular scheduled services operated pursuant to
Section 2, such aircraft may be used:

(1) for non-scheduled planeload passenger charters; or

(2) for scheduled or non-scheduled services limited to the
transportation of freight and/or mail in markets other than the markets
described in Section 2.01; or

(3) on an emergency basis in operations in other parts of Contractor's
system not covered by this Agreement.

ARTICLE 11 -- TRADEMARK LICENSE FOR OPERATIONS TO BE CONDUCTED
BY CONTRACTOR PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT

Section 11.01 Grant of Trademark License

Contractor will conduct all operations described in Section 2 above, and
any additional operations undertaken by subsequent amendment hereto under the
servicemark "AMERICA WEST EXPRESS" and shall utilize the AMERICA WEST EXPRESS
Servicemarks consisting of the exterior color decor and patterns on its aircraft
as prescribed by AWA. AWA hereby grants to Contractor a non-exclusive, non-
transferable license to use such AMERICA WEST EXPRESS Servicemarks in connection
with the services to be rendered by Contractor under this Agreement; provided,
however, that subject to the provisions of Section 202(b) hereof, at any time
during the life of this Agreement, AWA may alter, amend or revoke the license
hereby granted and require Contractor's use of any new or different AWA
Servicemarks in conjunction with the air transportation services provided
hereunder as AWA may determine in the exercise of its sole discretion and
judgment.

Section 11.02 Terms and Conditions Governing Trademark License

(a) Contractor hereby acknowledges AWA's ownership of the AWA Servicemarks,
further acknowledges the validity of the AWA Servicemarks, and agrees that it
will not do anything in any way to infringe or abridge AWA's rights in its
Servicemarks or directly or indirectly to challenge the validity of the AWA
Servicemarks.

(b) Contractor agrees that, in providing the services to be provided under
this Agreement in conjunction with one or more of the AWA Servicemarks, it will
conform to such customer service standards (including professional appearance
guidelines and uniform standards; ground equipment appearance standards; ticket
counter and gate area image standards; and other reasonable quality control
measures) as may be reasonably prescribed by AWA either specifically in this
Agreement or by subsequent communications to Contractor. AWA shall have the
rights, through such agents or representatives as it may designate, to inspect
the services and standards being performed by Contractor under this Agreement,
and in the event that, in AWA's opinion,

12
<PAGE> 14

there has been some deviation from such services and/or standards, Contractor
agrees upon written notice from AWA to rectify promptly any such deviation.

(c) Contractor shall not, without AWA's express written consent, advertise
the services to be rendered hereunder, nor make use of the AWA Servicemarks
referred to in Section 11.01 above in any advertising. AWA shall have absolute
discretion to withhold its consent concerning any and all such advertising and
use of the AWA Servicemarks in advertising by Contractor. In the event AWA
approves the use of such AWA Servicemarks in any advertising, such advertising
shall identify AWA as the owner of such servicemark(s), and to the extent that
any mark is registered, shall so specify.

(d) To the extent that Contractor is licensed to use the mark "AMERICA WEST
EXPRESS," Contractor will use said mark only in the mark "AMERICA WEST EXPRESS"
and then only in conjunction with the services specifically embraced by this
Agreement.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give Contractor the
exclusive right to use the AWA Servicemarks, or to abridge AWA's right to use
and/or to license its Servicemarks, and AWA hereby reserves the right to
continue use of the AWA Servicemarks as AWA may desire.

(f) No term or provision of this Agreement shall be construed to preclude
the use of the servicemarks "AMERICA WEST EXPRESS" or the aircraft exterior
color decor and patterns by other individuals or corporations not covered by
this Agreement so long as such use does not place such persons so authorized in
direct competition with Contractor in the markets covered by this Agreement,
subject to Contractor's right of first refusal set forth in Article 2.

(g) Should this Agreement be cancelled or otherwise terminated for any
reason as set forth in Article 9 hereof, the AWA Servicemarks shall revert to
AWA and shall not thereafter be used by Contractor in connection with any
operations of Contractor.

ARTICLE 12 -- ENTIRE AGREEMENT, AMENDMENT, NOTICES AND TITLES

Section 12.01 Entire Agreement and Amendments

(a) This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties
hereto unless subsequently amended as hereinafter provided, and said Agreement
shall not be modified or cancelled by mutual agreement or in any manner except
