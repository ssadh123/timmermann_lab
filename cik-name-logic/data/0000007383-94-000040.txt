Item 5. Other Events.

On October 3, 1994, an agreement in principal was reached among Armco 
Inc. ("Armco"), Eastern Stainless Corporation ("Eastern"), an 84%-owned 
subsidiary of Armco, and Avesta Sheffield Holding Company ("Avesta") for the 
sale of all of the assets of Eastern to Avesta for cash and the assumption 
of certain liabilities. After the proposed transaction is completed, and 
the proceeds have been applied against Eastern's remaining liabilities, 
Armco anticipates that Eastern will have no assets remaining and that 
Eastern as a corporate legal entity will be dissolved without any 
shareholder distribution.

The proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions, 
including completion of a definitive purchase agreement and approvals by 
regulatory authorities, the boards of directors of Eastern and Avesta, and 
Eastern's shareholders.

Armco will assume those of Eastern's liabilities that are neither 
assumed by Avesta nor satisfied by sale proceeds. In connection with the 
transaction, Armco expects to record a $15 million special charge against 
third quarter earnings.
