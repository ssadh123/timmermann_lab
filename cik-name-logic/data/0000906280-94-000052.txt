Item 5. Other Events.

On October 26, 1994, Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. (the
"Company") changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to
Louisiana by merging with a Louisiana corporation organized for
such purpose. The Company's stockholders approved the
reincorporation merger at its 1994 annual meeting as described in
greater detail in its proxy statement dated August 25, 1994. The
reincorporation did not change the name, business or management
of the Company but will significantly reduce the franchise taxes
and other costs incurred by the Company in maintaining a presence
in Delaware.
