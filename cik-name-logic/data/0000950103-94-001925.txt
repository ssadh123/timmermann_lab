Ladies and Gentlemen:

Federal Express Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), proposes that NationsBank of South Carolina, National
Association, acting not in its individual capacity but solely as pass
through trustee (the "Trustee") under the Pass Through Trust Agreement
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Basic Agreement"), as supplemented for each
series (each, a "Series") of pass through certificates (the "Pass Through
Certificates") to be purchased hereunder by a Series Supplement (each, a
"Series Supplement"), in each case between the Company and the Trustee (for

certificates ("Equipment Trust Certificates") which are to be issued as
nonrecourse obligations by an owner trustee, acting not in its individual
capacity but solely as owner trustee (the "Owner Trustee") under the Trust

Each of the thirteen series of Equipment Trust Certificates will be issued
under a separate Trust Indenture and Security Agreement between NationsBank
of Georgia, National Association, as Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture
Trustee") and the Owner Trustee (each, an "Indenture" and, collectively,
the "Indentures"). As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires,

Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). The Company has,
pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, filed with, or transmitted for
filing to, or shall within the required period of time hereafter file with
or transmit for filing to, the Commission a prospectus supplement (the
"Prospectus Supplement") specifically relating to the Offered Certificates,
together with a prospectus relating to pass through certificates. The term
"Registration Statement" means the above-referenced registration statement
in the form in which it became effective, including the exhibits thereto
and the documents incorporated by reference therein, as amended to the date
hereof. The term "Basic Prospectus" means the above-referenced prospectus
relating to pass through certificates. The term "Prospectus" means the
Basic Prospectus supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement. The term
"Preliminary Prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus supplement
specifically relating to the Offered Certificates together with the Basic

incorporated by reference therein. The terms "supplement" and "amendment"
or "amend" as used herein shall include all documents deemed to be
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus that have been filed subsequent
to the date of the Basic Prospectus by the Company with the Commission
pursuant to the Securities Exchange of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act").

shall have the meanings specified in or pursuant to the Pass Through
Agreement or the Indenture relating to each related series of Equipment

SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties.

(a) The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter, as
of the date hereof, as follows:

(i) Due Incorporation and Qualification. The Company has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing
under the laws of the state of Delaware, is a "citizen of the United
States" and a "certificated air carrier" within the meaning of the
Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the "Aviation Act"), has the
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus; and the
Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or
leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the
failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the
condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings, business affairs or
business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as
one enterprise.

(ii) Subsidiaries. Each subsidiary of the Company which is a
significant subsidiary as defined in Rule 405 of Regulation C of the
1933 Act Regulations (each a "Significant Subsidiary") has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required,

security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or
equity.

(iii) Registration Statement and Prospectus. At the time the
Registration Statement became effective, the Registration Statement
complied, and as of the date hereof does comply, in all material
respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act
Regulations and the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission promulgated thereunder. The Registration Statement, at the
time it became effective, did not, and at each time thereafter at which
any amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective and any
Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed by the Company with the Commission,
will not, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, as of the
date hereof does not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that the representations and
warranties in this subsection shall not apply to statements in or
omissions from the Registration Statement or Prospectus made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the
Company in writing by an Underwriter expressly for use in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus, to that part of the Registration
Statement which constitutes the Indenture Trustee's Statement of
Eligibility under the 1939 Act (Form T-1), or to those sections of the
Prospectus captioned "Description of the Letters of Credit" and
"Appendix B -- Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale." No stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been
issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or
threatened by the Commission.

(iv) Incorporated Documents. The documents incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are
filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "1934 Act Regulations"), and,
when read together and with the other information in the Prospectus,
did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(v) Accountants. The accountants who certified the financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus are
independent public accountants as required by the 1933 Act and the 1933
Act Regulations.

(vi) Financial Statements. The financial statements of the Company
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the
Registration Statement present fairly the financial position of the
Company as of the dates thereof and the results of operations, changes
in common stockholders' investment and cash flows of the Company, for
the respective periods covered thereby, all in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis
throughout the entire period involved, except as stated in such
financial statements; and the financial schedules included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement meet the
requirements of the 1933 Act Regulations or the 1934 Act Regulations,
as applicable, and accurately present the information required to be
shown therein.

(vii) Material Changes or Material Transactions. Except as stated in
the Prospectus, subsequent to the respective dates as of which
information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus,
the Company has not incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or
contingent, or entered into any transactions which are material to the
Company, and there has not been any material change in the capital
stock or short-term debt, or any material increase in long-term debt of
the Company, or any material adverse change, or any development
involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition
(financial or other), business, prospects, net worth or results of
operations of the Company.

(viii) No Defaults; Regulatory Approvals. Neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries is in violation of its charter or in default in
the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement,
covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage,
loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which it is a party
or by which it or any of them or their properties may be bound; and the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, each Pass
Through Agreement and any other Operative Agreement to which the
Company is or is to be a party and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein and therein have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and will not conflict with or constitute a
breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of
any lien (other than as will be permitted under the Leases), charge or
encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to, any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan
agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which the Company or any
such subsidiary is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound
or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any such
subsidiary is subject, which conflict, breach or default would have,
individually or in the aggregate with any other such instances, a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or other),
business, prospects, net worth or results of operations of the Company
and its subsidiaries considered as one entity, nor will such action
result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of
the Company or any law, administrative regulation or administrative or
court order or decree currently in effect or in effect at the time of
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Pass Through Agreement
and the other Operative Agreements and applicable to the Company or any
of its subsidiaries; and no consent, approval, authorization, order or
decree of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any Pass Through Agreement or any other Operative Agreement
to which the Company is or is to be a party, except such as may be
required under the 1933 Act, the 1939 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations or
state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Aviation Act, and the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in Delaware and Tennessee.

(ix) Legal Proceedings; Contracts. Except for matters described in
the Prospectus (as to which the Company makes no representation as to
the outcome), there is no pending legal, governmental or administrative
proceeding or series of related proceedings to which the Company is a
party or of which any property of the Company is the subject which is
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate to have a material
adverse effect on the condition (financial or other), business,
prospects, net worth or results of operations of the Company on a
consolidated basis, to the best knowledge of any financial or legal
officer of the Company, no such proceedings are threatened or
contemplated against the Company by governmental authorities or others
and no basis for any such proceedings exists; and there are no
contracts or documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which
are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement by
the 1933 Act or by the 1933 Act Regulations which have not been so
filed.

(x) Compliance with Laws. The Company's business and operations
comply in all material respects with all laws and regulations
applicable thereto and there are no known, proposed or threatened
changes in any laws or regulations which would have a material adverse
effect on the Company or the manner in which it conducts its business;
the Company possesses all valid and effective certificates, licenses
and permits required to conduct its business as now conducted, except
for instances which individually or in the aggregate do not, or will
not, have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
other), business, prospects, net worth or results of operations of the
Company.

(xi) Enforceability of Operative Agreements. Each of the Pass
Through Agreements and the other Operative Agreements to which the
Company is or is to be a party have been duly authorized by the
Company, will each be substantially in the form heretofore supplied to
the Underwriters and, when duly executed and delivered by the Company
and the other parties thereto, will each constitute a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms. The Basic Agreement as executed is
substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement and has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.

(xii) Validity of the Offered Certificates. When executed, issued,
authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of the
applicable Pass Through Agreement and sold and paid for as provided in
this Agreement, each Series of Offered Certificates will constitute
valid and legally binding obligations of the Trustee enforceable in
accordance with their terms; and the Certificateholders of such Offered
Certificates will be entitled to the benefits provided by such Pass
Through Agreement.

(xiii) Equipment Trust Certificates. The Equipment Trust Certificates
to be issued under each applicable Indenture, when duly executed and
delivered by the related Owner Trustee and duly authenticated by the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with the terms of such Indenture, will
be duly issued under such Indenture and will constitute the valid and
binding obligations of such Owner Trustee, and the Holders thereof will
be entitled to the benefits of such Indenture.

(xiv) Due Execution. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company.

(xv) Descriptions. The Offered Certificates, Pass Through
Agreements, Indentures, Participation Agreements, Leases and other
Operative Agreements conform, or will upon execution conform, in all
material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus.

The representations and warranties made by the Company as to the
enforceability of the Pass Through Agreements, the Indentures, the Offered
Certificates, the Equipment Trust Certificates and any other Operative
Agreement to which the Company is or is to be a party set forth in
subparagraphs (xi), (xii) and (xiii) above are limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights or by general equity
principles, and the enforceability of any Pass Through Agreement, Lease and
Indenture is also limited by applicable laws which may affect the remedies
provided therein but which do not affect the validity of such Pass Through
Agreement, Lease or Indenture or make such remedies inadequate for the
practical realization of the benefits intended to be provided thereby.

(b) Lufthansa represents and warrants to each Underwriter and to
the Company that those sections of the Prospectus captioned "Description of
the Letters of Credit" and "Appendix B -- Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale," as of the date hereof, do not contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

(c) Additional Certifications. Any certificate signed by any
officer or general partner, as the case may be, of the Company, Lufthansa
or the Owner Participant and delivered to the Underwriters or to counsel
for the Underwriters in connection with an offering of the Offered
Certificates shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company,
Lufthansa or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, to each Underwriter
participating in such offering as to the matters covered thereby on the
date of such certificate and unless subsequently amended or supplemented
subsequent thereto.

referred to as a "Closing Time"). Delivery of the Offered Certificates
shall be made for the account of the Underwriters as specified in Schedule
II against payment by the Underwriters of the purchase price thereof to, or
upon the order of, the Trustee (or such other person as the Company may
direct) by wire transfer of federal or other immediately available funds or
by intra-bank transfer of immediately available funds. Such Offered
Certificates shall be registered in such names, and in such denominations,
as the Underwriters may request in writing at least two business days prior
to the Closing Time. Such Offered Certificates, which may be in temporary
form, will be made available for examination and packaging by the

their undertakings to distribute Offered Certificates, the Owner
Participant will pay to the Underwriters an amount equal to that percentage
of the aggregate amount of each series of Offered Certificates purchased by
the Underwriters as set forth in the sixth column of Exhibit A as the
underwriting discounts and commissions. Such payment shall be made at the
Closing Time simultaneously with the payment by the Underwriters to the
Trustee of the purchase price of the Offered Certificates as specified in
Section 2(b) hereof. Payment of such compensation shall be made by wire
transfer of federal or other immediately available funds or by intra-bank
transfer of immediately available funds.

SECTION 3. Covenants of the Company.

The Company covenants with each of the Underwriters as follows:

(a) Prospectus Supplement. The Company has prepared a
Preliminary Prospectus containing such information as the Underwriters and
the Company have deemed appropriate, and immediately following the
execution of this Agreement the Company will prepare a Prospectus
Supplement setting forth such information as the Underwriters and the
Company deem appropriate in connection with the offering of the Offered
Certificates. The Company will promptly transmit copies of the Prospectus
Supplement to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933
Act Regulations.

(b) Notice of Certain Events. The Company will notify the
Underwriters immediately (i) of the effectiveness of any amendment to the
Registration Statement, (ii) of the transmittal to the Commission for
filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document to be filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus, (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission with
respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Prospectus
Supplement relating in any way to the offer and sale of the Offered
Certificates, (iv) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to
the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus
or for additional information, and (v) of the issuance by the Commission of
any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. The Company will
make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and,
if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest
possible moment.

(c) Notice of Certain Proposed Filings. The Company will give
notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the
Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus,
whether by the filing of documents pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act
or otherwise, and will furnish the Underwriters with copies of any such
amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed or prepared
a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or preparation, as the
case may be.

(d) Copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The
Company will deliver to the Underwriters one signed copy and as many
conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of
each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated
by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus) as the Underwriters may reasonably request. The Company will
furnish to the Underwriters as many copies of the Prospectus (as amended or
supplemented) as the Underwriters shall reasonably request so long as the
Underwriters are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales
or solicitations of offers to purchase the Offered Certificates.

(e) Revisions of Prospectus -- Material Changes. If at any time
when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in
connection with sales of the Offered Certificates any event shall occur or
condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, to
further amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus
will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is
delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the reasonable
opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the
requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations the Company will
promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendment or supplement,
whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act or
otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission
or to make the Registration Statement and Prospectus comply with such
requirements.

(f) Earnings Statements. The Company will make generally
available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later
than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings
statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the 1933
Act) covering each twelve-month period beginning, in each case, not later
than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the
"effective date" (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration
Statement with respect to each sale of Offered Certificates.

(g) Blue Sky Qualifications. The Company will endeavor, in
cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Offered Certificates for
offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and
other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate,
and will maintain such qualifications in effect for so long as may be

required for the distribution of the Offered Certificates; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general
consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or to
subject itself to taxation as doing business in any jurisdiction in which
it is not otherwise required to be so qualified. The Company will file
such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each
jurisdiction in which the Offered Certificates have been qualified as
provided above.

(h) 1934 Act Filings. The Company, during the period when the
Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, will file
promptly all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to
Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.

(i) Stand-Off Agreement. The Company will not, between the date
of this Agreement and termination of any trading restrictions with respect
to the Offered Certificates (as notified to the Company by the
Underwriters) or the Closing Time, whichever is later, (i) without the
prior written consent of the Underwriters, offer or sell, or enter into any
agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company pursuant to a public
offering of securities registered under the 1933 Act (other than the
Offered Certificates which are to be sold pursuant hereto and commercial
paper in the ordinary course of business), (ii) offer or sell, or enter
into any agreement to sell, any equipment notes, pass through certificates,
equipment trust certificates or equipment purchase certificates secured by
aircraft owned or leased by the Company (or rights relating thereto) unless
the Company has provided the Underwriters at least three business days'
notice thereof, or (iii) as may otherwise be provided in Schedule II.

Prospectus, but shall not otherwise be obligated to pay any other expenses
incident thereto.

If this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriters in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5 or clause (i) of Section 9 hereof, the
Owner Participant shall reimburse upon demand the Underwriters for all of
their out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters that shall have been incurred
by the Underwriters in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of
the Offered Certificates.

SECTION 5. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations.

possible downgrading, and (iii) there shall not have come to the attention

that the Prospectus, including the Prospectus Supplement, at the time it
was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Offered Certificates,

material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances existing at such time, not misleading.

(b) Legal Opinions. At the Closing Time, the Underwriters shall
have received the following documents:

letter from

Arthur Andersen & Co. or their successors as the Company's independent
accountants (the "Independent Accountants"), dated as of the date hereof
and of the Closing Time, as the case may be, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Underwriters, to the effect that:

(i) they are independent public accountants within the meaning of
the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations;

(ii) in their opinion the Company's financial statements and
schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement and Prospectus and covered by their reports included or

statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company
responsible for financial and accounting matters, a reading of the
minute books of the Company, and other specified procedures and
inquiries, nothing has come to their attention that caused them to

do not comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933
Act Regulations or the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations

audited financial statements of the Company incorporated in the
Prospectus;

(B) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the

long-term debt of the Company or, as of such date, there has been
any decrease in assets or common stockholders' investment, in each
case as compared with amounts shown in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included or incorporated
in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except in each
case for changes or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have
occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; or

(C) for the period from the date of the most recent financial

operating revenues, operating income, income before taxes or net

period of the preceding year, except in each case for decreases
which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which
are described in such letter; and

(v) in addition to their audit referred to in their reports included
or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus and the review, inquiries and procedures referred to in
clauses (iii) and (iv) above, such letter shall state that Arthur
Andersen & Co. has performed other specified procedures, with respect
to certain numerical data and information included or incorporated in
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as are requested by an
Underwriter and specified in such letter and have found such data and
information to be in agreement with the accounting records of or
analyses prepared by the Company.

(e) Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent in Participation
Agreements. At the Closing Time, all conditions precedent specified in
each Participation Agreement with respect to the issuance of the related
Equipment Trust Certificates shall have been satisfied; the representations
and warranties of the Company, the Owner Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, the LC Bank and the Owner Participant contained in
each of the Participation Agreements shall be accurate as of the Closing
Time (except to the extent that they relate solely to an earlier date in

Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as
such counsel may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling such
counsel to pass upon the issuance and sale of Offered Certificates as
herein contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence the
accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or
the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all
proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale
of Offered Certificates as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in
form and substance to the Underwriters and to counsel for the Underwriters.

If any condition specified in this Section shall not have been
fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be

SECTION 6. Indemnification.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within
the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act as follows:

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, joint or several, as incurred, arising out of or based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or
the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading;

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, joint or several, as incurred, to the extent of the
aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation
or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or
threatened, or of any claim whatsoever arising out of or based upon any
such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement
or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of
the Company; and

(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever (including the fees and
disbursements of counsel chosen by the Underwriters), joint or several,
as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever arising out of or based upon any such untrue statement or
omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the
extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;

provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
the Company by any Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), made in reliance upon the Trustee's Form T-1 Statement
of Eligibility under the 1939 Act filed as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement or made in those sections of the Prospectus (as amended or
supplemented) captioned "Description of the Letters of Credit" and
"Appendix B -- Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale;" and provided,
further, that the foregoing indemnity agreement, with respect to any
Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter
from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities purchased Offered Certificates, or any person controlling such
Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented
if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto)
was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person,
if required by law so to have been delivered by or on behalf of such
Underwriter, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the
Offered Certificates by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person,
and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the
defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities.

(b) Lufthansa agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Underwriter and each person (if any) who controls any Underwriter within
the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any and all loss,
liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained
in subsection (a) of this Section 6, as incurred, but only with respect to
untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions,
made in the sections of the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) captioned "Description of the Letters of Credit" and "Appendix B
- -- Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale."

(c) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the directors and officers of the Company, each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15
of the 1933 Act and Lufthansa, the directors and officers of Lufthansa and
each person, if any, who controls Lufthansa within the meaning of Section
15 of the 1933 Act against any and all loss, liability,

claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in
subsection (a) of this Section 6, as incurred, but only with respect to
untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions,
made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the
Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto).

(d) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each
indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying
party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it
may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An
indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of
such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local
counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in
connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions
in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances.

SECTION 7. Contribution.

In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 is
for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although
applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, Lufthansa and the
Underwriters of each offering of Offered Certificates shall contribute to
the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the
nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company,
Lufthansa and one or more of the Underwriters in respect of such offering,
as incurred, in such proportions that the Underwriters are responsible for
that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount
appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus in respect of such offering
bears to the initial public offering price appearing thereon and the
Company and Lufthansa, severally, are responsible for the balance, to the
extent set forth in Section 6; provided, however, that no person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution

from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7 to contribute are several
in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls an
Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the
same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, each director of the
Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement,
and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of
Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as
the Company and each director and officer of Lufthansa and each person, if
any, who controls Lufthansa within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933
Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Lufthansa.

SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.

All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company or
Lufthansa submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
any party hereto, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of
the Offered Certificates.

SECTION 9. Termination of Agreement.

The Underwriters may also terminate this Agreement, immediately
upon notice to the Company, at any time prior to the Closing Time (i) if
there has been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material
adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the
earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company, whether or
not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there shall have
occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United
States or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or
international calamity or crisis, the effect of which shall be such as to
make it, in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable to market the
Offered Certificates or enforce contracts for the sale of the Offered
Certificates, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company shall
have been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or
if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York
Stock Exchange shall have

been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have been
fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall have been
required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any
other governmental authority, or if a banking moratorium shall have been
declared by either federal or New York authorities. In the event of any
termination of this Agreement, the covenant set forth in Section 3(f)
hereof, the provisions of Section 4 hereof, the indemnity and contribution
agreements set forth in Sections 6 and 7 hereof, and the provisions of
Sections 8 and 13 hereof shall remain in effect.

SECTION 10. Default by One or More of the Underwriters.

If any Underwriter shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the
Offered Certificates which it is obligated to purchase hereunder (the
"Defaulted Certificates"), then the remaining Underwriter (the "Non-
Defaulting Underwriter") shall have the right, but not the obligation,
within 24 hours thereafter, to arrange for another party or parties to
purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Certificates upon the
terms herein set forth; if, however, the Non-Defaulting Underwriter shall
not have completed such arrangements for the purchase of all of the
Defaulted Certificates within such 24-hour period, then this Agreement
shall terminate without liability on the part of the Non-Defaulting
Underwriter.

No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any
defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default under this
Agreement.

In the event of any such default which does not result in a
termination of this Agreement, either the Non-Defaulting Underwriter or the
Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not
exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or
arrangements. With respect to the Defaulted Certificates, the term
"Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person
substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had
originally been a party to this Agreement.

Exhibit B

Opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell,
Special Counsel for the Company

The opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, special
counsel for the Company, to be delivered pursuant to
Section 5(b)(1) of the Underwriting Agreement shall be
to the effect that:

1. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.

2. The Registration Statement has become
effective under the 1933 Act and the Basic Agreement
has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.

3. Although we are not aware of any judicial
authority, none of the Pass Through Trusts is required
to be registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

4. The Pass Through Trusts will not be
classified as associations taxable as corporations,
but, rather, will be classified as grantor trusts
under subpart E, Part I of Subchapter J of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and each
Certificateholder will be treated as the owner of a
pro rata undivided interest in each of the Equipment
Trust Certificates and any other property held in the
related Pass Through Trust. With respect to all other
matters addressed in the Basic Prospectus under the
caption "Federal Income Tax Consequences," we are also
of the opinions ascribed to us therein.

We have considered the matters required to be
included in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus and the information contained therein. In
our opinion (i) the statements in the Basic Prospectus
under the captions "Description of the Pass Through
Certificates" and "Description of the Equipment Trust
Certificates" and in the Prospectus Supplement under
the captions "Description of the Pass Through
Certificates" and Description of the Equipment Trust
Certificates," insofar as such statements constitute a
summary of the Pass Through Agreement, the Leases, the
Agreement to Lease, the Participation Agreements, the
Indentures and the Collateral Agreements fairly
present the information called for by the 1933 Act and
the 1933 Act Regulations with respect thereto and
fairly summarize the material provisions thereof and
(ii) the statements in the Basic Prospectus in the
____ paragraph under the caption "Description of the
Equipment Trust Certificates -- Security" and in the
Prospectus Supplement in the ___ paragraph under the
caption "Description of the Equipment Trust
Certificates -- Remedies," insofar as such statements
constitute a description of Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code as such Section would be applicable to
the Offered Certificates, fairly summarize the
material provisions of such Section as such Section
would be applicable to the Equipment Trust
Certificates. The Offered Certificates conform in all
material respects to the summary descriptions thereof
contained in the Prospectus.

We have not ourselves checked the accuracy or
completeness of, or otherwise verified, the
information furnished with respect to other matters in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. We have
generally reviewed and discussed with certain officers
and employees of the Company, its independent public
accountants and your representatives and counsel the
information furnished, whether or not subject to our
check and verification. On the basis of such
consideration, review and discussion, but without
independent check or verification, except as stated,
(i) we are of the opinion that the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented (except for the financial statements and
other financial and statistical information set forth
or incorporated by reference therein and the section
of the Prospectus Supplement captioned "Appendix B --
Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale," as to which we
are not called upon to express any opinion) comply as
to form in all material respects with the 1933 Act and
the applicable 1933 Act Regulations and (ii) we have
no reason to believe that the Registration Statement
(except for the financial statements and other
financial information set forth or incorporated by
reference therein and the Statement of Eligibility
(Form T-1) under the 1939 Act of NationsBank of South
Carolina, National Association, as to all of which we
are not called upon to express a belief) at the time
the Registration Statement became effective contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or that, as of its date or as of the
Closing Time, the Prospectus (except for the financial
statements and other financial information set forth
or incorporated by reference therein and the section
of the Prospectus Supplement captioned "Appendix B --
Westdeutsche Landesbank Gironzentrale," as to which we
are not called upon to express a belief), contained or
contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.
In expressing the foregoing opinion and belief we do
not assume any responsibility for the adequacy or
accuracy of the derivation or compilation from the
Company's financial statements or financial records of
any financial or statistical data included in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the
following qualifications:

(a) We are members of the Bar of the State
of New York and the foregoing opinions are limited to
the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of
the United States of America and the General
Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware.

(b) We express no opinion as to the scope,
effect or other matters arising under the Federal
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, or the rules and
regulations thereunder or as to matters involving
filing and recording with the Federal Aviation
Administration.

(c) This opinion is issued solely to you in
connection with the above matter and may not be relied
upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or
furnished to any other person without our prior
written consent.

Re: Federal Express Corporation
Pass Through Certificates (the "Offered Certificates")
------------------------------------------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is directed to the Underwriters pursuant to Section
5(b)(2) of the Underwriting Agreement dated March __, 1994 (the
"Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, LLG Aircraft Leasing, L.P.,
Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft and you, with respect to the offer
and sale of the Offered Certificates. All terms defined or used in the
Underwriting Agreement have the same meaning when used herein, unless
otherwise noted.

I am Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company and
have acted as such in connection with the Offered Certificates and the
Underwriting Agreement. I or attorneys under my supervision have made such
examination and investigation as we have deemed necessary in order to give
the following opinion.

Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that:

(i) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and
validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and the Company has full corporate power and authority under such laws to
own its properties and to conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus; the Company is a "certificated air carrier" and a "citizen of
the United States" within the meaning of the Aviation Act; the Company is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which it owns or leases real property or in which the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except for such instances which in
the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the Company;

(ii) Each subsidiary of the Company which is a significant
subsidiary as defined in Rule 405 of Regulation C of the 1933 Act
Regulations (each a "Significant Subsidiary") has been duly incorporated
and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described
in the Registration Statement, and, to the best of my knowledge, is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required,
except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse
effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings, business
affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as one enterprise; all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of each Significant Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly
issued and is fully paid and nonassessable, and all of such capital stock,
except for directors' qualifying shares, is owned by the Company, directly
or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any mortgage, pledge, lien,
encumbrance, claim or equity;

(iii) Except for matters described in the Prospectus (as
to which I express no opinion concerning the outcome), there is no pending
legal, governmental or administrative proceeding or series of related
proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any property of the
Company is the subject which is reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
other), business, prospects, net worth or results of operations of the
Company; and, to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are
threatened or contemplated against the Company by governmental authorities
or others and no basis for any such proceedings exists;

(iv) Each of the Operative Agreements to which the
Company is a party has been duly and validly authorized and, except for the
Leases and Lease Supplements covering the Aircraft and the Tax Indemnity
Agreements, has been executed and delivered by the Company.

(v) The Equipment Trust Certificates are in due and
proper form and have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action;

(vi) The Company possesses all permits, approvals,
franchises and other rights from federal aviation, aeronautical,
communications, transportation and shipping authorities which are requisite
for the conduct of its business as described in the Prospectus or for the
actions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the offering
contemplated by the Prospectus; and the actions contemplated by the
Underwriting Agreement and the Operative Agreements,
and the offering contemplated by the Prospectus, are not in violation of
any federal statute or regulation relating to aviation, aeronautics,
communications, transportation or shipping;

(vii) The Basic Agreement is qualified under the 1939
Act; I have reviewed or caused to be reviewed by attorneys under my
supervision the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and each amendment
and supplement thereto (including the documents incorporated by reference)
and have no reason to believe that, as of their respective effective or
issue dates, or as of the Closing Time, either the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement (or any such
documents incorporated by reference) (except for the sections of the
Prospectus Supplement captioned "Description of the Letters of Credit" and
"Appendix B - Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale," as to which I express
no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading;

(viii) I do not know of any statute or regulation or
legal or governmental proceeding required to be described in the Prospectus
which is not described as required, nor of any contract or document of a
character required to be described in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement which
is not described and filed as required; and the descriptions in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus of the contracts and other
documents (except for the Letters of Credit, as to which I express no
opinion) therein described are accurate and fairly present the information
required to be shown;

(ix) The execution and delivery by the Company of the
Underwriting Agreement and each of the Operative Agreements to which the
Company is a party, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
herein and therein contemplated and compliance with the terms of the
Underwriting Agreement and such Operative Agreements do not and will not
conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms of the Certificate
of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, and will not conflict with or
result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, credit or note
agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument material to the Company
to which the Company is a party or by which it or any or its properties are
bound, or any existing applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or
decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court,
having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties;

(x) The statements in the Basic Prospectus under the
captions "Description of the Pass Through Certificates" and "Description of
the Equipment Trust Certificates" and in the Prospectus Supplement under
the captions "Description of the Pass Through Certificates," "The Pre-
Funding Periods" and "Description of the Equipment Trust Certificates,"
insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the Pass Through
Agreements, the Offered Certificates, the Leases, the Participation
Agreements, the Indentures, the Collateral Agreements and the Agreement to
Lease, are accurate summaries of the material provisions thereof and fairly
present the information called for by the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act
Regulations with respect thereto;

(xi) No authorization, approval, consent or license of
any regulatory body or authority (other than under the 1933 Act, the 1939
Act and the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states) is required
for the valid authorization, issuance, sale and delivery of the Offered
Certificates as herein contemplated or the valid authorization, execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and
the Operative Agreements to which the Company is a party or the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein, or, if so required, all such authorizations, approvals, consents
and licenses, specifying the sale, have been obtained and are in full force
and effect;

(xii) The Registration Statement has become effective
under the 1933 Act and, to the best of my knowledge, no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued
and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or
contemplated under the 1933 Act; the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement thereto (except for the
financial statements and schedules included therein, as to which I express
no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects to the requirements
of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and, as to documents
incorporated therein, to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act
Regulations in effect at the time such documents were filed with the
Commission; and

(xiii) Each of the Underwriting Agreement and the
Indemnification Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement thereof is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights or by general equity principles and
subject to any principles of public policy limiting the right to enforce
the indemnification and contribution provisions contained in Sections 6
and 7 of the Underwriting Agreement and Sections 2 and 3 of the
Indemnification Agreement.

In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that (i) all
signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine and that where any
such signature (other than a signature purporting to have been made on
behalf of the Company) purports to have been made in a corporate,
governmental, fiduciary or other capacity, the person who affixed such
signature had the due authority to do so, (ii) certain factual matters
contained in certificates of public officials are accurate, true and
correct and (iii) photostatic copies of such documents, records and
certificates conform to the originals.

This opinion is intended solely for the benefit of the
Underwriters and is not to be relied on by, and no copies of it are to be
delivered to, any other person without my prior written consent, except
that Underwriters' counsel may rely upon this opinion as to all matters of
Tennessee law or Delaware corporate law in rendering its opinion of even
date herewith. I am not assuming any professional responsibility to any
other person by rendering this opinion.

It is understood that this opinion speaks as of the date given,
notwithstanding any delivery as contemplated above on any other date.

accordance with Section 2.01(c) shall equal in the
aggregate the aggregate principal amount of the

Pass Through Trustee pursuant to the related
Participation Agreements and evidence the entire
ownership of the related Pass Through Trust. The Pass
Through Trustee shall issue and sell such Pass Through

facsimile signatures of such officer and minor errors
or defects in any reproduction of any such signature
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
Pass Through Certificate which has been duly
authenticated and delivered by the Pass Through
Trustee.

If any officer of the Pass Through Trustee
who signs any of the Pass Through Certificates
subsequently ceases to be such officer before the Pass
Through Certificate so signed is authenticated and
delivered or disposed of by the Pass Through Trustee,
such Pass Through Certificate nevertheless may be
authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though
the person who signed such Pass Through Certificate
had not ceased to be such officer of the Pass Through
Trustee; and any Pass Through Certificate may be
signed on behalf of the Pass Through Trustee by such
person or persons as, at the actual date of the
execution of such Pass Through Certificate, are the

Trust. Only such Pass Through Certificates of such

authentication substantially in the form set forth in

manual or facsimile signature of one of its authorized
officers, shall be entitled to the benefits of the
related Pass Through Trust or be valid or obligatory

Trustee upon any Pass Through Certificate for such
Series executed by the Pass Through Trustee shall be

evidenced on the Register for such Series, is entitled
to the benefits of the related Pass Through Trust.

SECTION 2.07. Form of Pass Through

Pass Through Agreement or the related Series

as provided in Section 3.02, and the Pass Through
Trustee shall execute, authenticate and deliver in
exchange therefor the Pass Through Certificate or Pass
Through Certificates which the Certificateholder
making the exchange shall be entitled to receive,
bearing numbers not contemporaneously or previously
outstanding.

All Pass Through Certificates presented for
registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or
payment shall (if so required by the Pass Through
Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Pass Through Trustee duly executed
by, the Certificateholder or his attorney duly
authorized in writing.

The Pass Through Trustee may require payment
from the Certificateholder of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any exchange or
registration of transfer of Pass Through Certificates.
No service charge to the Certificateholder shall be
made for any such transaction.

All Pass Through Certificates issued upon any
transfer or exchange of Pass Through Certificates
shall evidence ownership in the same Pass Through
Trust and be entitled to the same benefits under this
Pass Through Agreement and the applicable Series
Supplement, as the Pass Through Certificates
surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

SECTION 2.09. Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed,
Lost and Stolen Pass Through Certificates. If any
temporary or definitive Pass Through Certificate
becomes mutilated, defaced or is apparently destroyed,
lost or stolen, the Pass Through Trustee in its
discretion may execute, authenticate and deliver, a
new Pass Through Certificate of like Fractional
Undivided Interest in the related Pass Through Trust,
bearing a number not contemporaneously or previously
outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the
mutilated or defaced Pass Through Certificate, or in
lieu of and substitution for the Pass Through
Certificate so apparently destroyed, lost or stolen.
In every case the applicant for a substitute Pass
Through Certificate shall furnish to the Pass Through
Trustee and any agent of the Pass Through Trustee such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to
indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless
from any such substitution and, in every case of
destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their
satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or
theft of such Pass Through Certificate and of the
ownership thereof.

Upon the issuance of any substitute Pass
Through Certificate, the Pass Through Trustee may
require payment from the Certificateholder of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other reasonable expenses (including the reasonable
fees and expenses of the Pass Through Trustee)
connected therewith. If any Pass Through Certificate
of a Pass Through Trust for which a notice of
termination has been or is about to be given pursuant
to Section 12.01 becomes mutilated or defaced or is
apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Pass Through
Trustee may, instead of issuing a substitute Pass
Through Certificate, pay or authorize the payment of
the same (without surrender thereof except in the case
of a mutilated or defaced Pass Through Certificate),
if the applicant for such payment furnishes to the
Pass Through Trustee and any agent of the Pass Through
Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may
require to save each of them harmless from all risks,
however remote, resulting from such payment and, in
every case of apparent destruction, loss or theft, the
applicant shall also furnish to the Pass Through
Trustee and any agent of the Pass Through Trustee
evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent
destruction, loss or theft of such Pass Through
Certificate and of the ownership thereof.

Every substitute Pass Through Certificate
issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by
virtue of the fact that any Pass Through Certificate
is apparently destroyed, lost or stolen will
constitute conclusive evidence of the Fractional
Undivided Interest in the applicable Pass Through
Trust evidenced by the Pass Through Certificate that
it replaces, whether or not the apparently destroyed,
lost or stolen Pass Through Certificate may be
enforceable at any time by anyone and will be entitled
to all the benefits of (but will be subject to all the
limitations of rights set forth in) the applicable
Pass Through Trust equally and proportionately with
any and all other Pass Through Certificates duly
authenticated and delivered therefor. All Pass
Through Certificates will be held and owned upon the
express condition that, to the extent permitted by
law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with
respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated,
defaced, or apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Pass
Through Certificates and will preclude any and all
other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or
statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary
with respect to the replacement or payment of
negotiable instruments or other securities without
their surrender.

SECTION 2.10. Cancellation of Pass Through
Certificates; Destruction Thereof. All Pass Through
Certificates surrendered for payment, redemption,
registration of transfer or exchange, if surrendered
to any agent of the Pass Through Trustee, shall be
delivered to the Pass Through Trustee for cancellation
or, if surrendered to the Pass Through Trustee, shall
be cancelled by it; and no Pass Through Certificates
shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly
permitted by any of the provisions of this Pass
Through Agreement or the applicable Series Supplement.
The Pass Through Trustee shall destroy cancelled Pass
Through Certificates held by it.

SECTION 2.11. Temporary Pass Through
Certificates. Pending the preparation of definitive
Pass Through Certificates of any Series, the Pass
Through Trustee may execute, authenticate and deliver
temporary Pass Through Certificates for such Series
(printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise
reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the
executing officer of the Pass Through Trustee, as
evidenced by such officer's execution thereof). Such
temporary Pass Through Certificates shall be issuable
as registered Pass Through Certificates without
coupons, of any authorized denomination, and
substantially in the form of the definitive Pass
Through Certificates of such Series but with such
omissions, insertions and variations as may be
appropriate for temporary Pass Through Certificates,
all as may be determined by the executing officer of
the Pass Through Trustee, as evidenced by such
officer's execution thereof. Temporary Pass Through
Certificates may contain such reference to any
provisions of this Pass Through Agreement or the
applicable Series Supplement as may be appropriate.
Every such temporary Pass Through Certificate shall be
executed and authenticated by the Pass Through Trustee
upon the same conditions and in substantially the same
manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Pass
Through Certificates of such Series. Without
unreasonable delay the Company shall furnish
definitive Pass Through Certificates for such Series
and thereupon temporary Pass Through Certificates
shall be surrendered in exchange therefor without
charge at any office or agency to be maintained by the
Pass Through Trustee for the purpose pursuant to
Section 3.02, and the Pass Through Trustee shall
execute, authenticate and deliver in exchange for such
temporary Pass Through Certificates such definitive
Pass Through Certificates evidencing a like aggregate
Fractional Undivided Interest in the applicable Pass
Through Trust in authorized denominations. Until so
exchanged, temporary Pass Through Certificates shall
be entitled to the same benefits under the applicable
Pass Through Trust as definitive Pass Through
Certificates of the applicable Series.

substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Company under this Agreement and each
Series Supplement with the same effect as if such
successor corporation or such Person, as the case may

successor corporation which shall theretofore have
become such in the manner prescribed in this Section
from its liability hereunder or under any Series

(b) For each Pass Through Trust, on each

related Pass Through Trust for such calendar year or,
in the event such Person was a Certificateholder of
such Series during a portion of such calendar year,

SECTION 5.04. Investment of Special Payment
Moneys. Any money received by the Pass Through

Special Payment that is not to be promptly distributed
shall, to the extent practicable, be invested by the
Pass Through Trustee in Permitted Investments selected
by the Company pending distribution of such Special

make the payment required under Section 5.02 on the
applicable Special Distribution Date and the Pass

maturity of any Permitted Investment shall not be
reinvested pending distribution. The Pass Through
Trustee shall have no liability with respect to any
investment made pursuant to this Section, other than
by reason of the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Pass Through Trustee. All income
and earnings from such investments shall be
distributed on such Special Distribution Date as part
of such Special Payment.

SECTION 5.05. Withholding Taxes. The Pass
Through Trustee shall withhold any taxes required to
be withheld on payments to any Certificateholder,
except to the extent that such Certificateholder has
furnished evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Pass
Through Trustee of any exemption from withholding
claimed by such Certificateholder, and under no
circumstances shall the failure of any such
Certificateholder to receive any amounts so withheld
constitute an Event of Default. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary herein, if the Company is
required to pay any withholding tax or any interest or
penalty thereon, the Pass Through Trustee shall be
entitled to retain any payments otherwise
distributable to such Certificateholder that was
subject to such withholding until such amounts shall
have been recovered in full by the Pass Through
Trustee.

substantially similar instruments signed by such

Act, such record date shall be a date not more than 15
days prior to the first solicitation of such vote or
consent.

Certificates shall be proved by the Register or by a
certificate of the Registrar.

SECTION 6.03. Certificateholders to Be
Treated as Owners. Prior to due presentment for
registration of transfer of any Pass Through
Certificate, each related Indenture Trustee, the Pass
Through Trustee, any agent of any such related
Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, the
Paying Agent, if any, the Registrar and the Company
may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Pass
Through Certificate shall be registered upon the
Register as the absolute owner of such Pass Through
Certificate (whether or not such Pass Through
Certificate shall be overdue and notwithstanding any
notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for
the purpose of receiving payment on account of the
principal payable with respect to and, subject to the
provisions of this Pass Through Agreement, interest
payable with respect to such Pass Through Certificate
and for all other purposes; and neither any such
related Indenture Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee
(nor any agent of any such related Indenture Trustee
or the Pass Through Trustee) nor the Paying Agent, if
any, nor the Registrar nor the Company shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary. All such
payments so made to any such person, or upon his
order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum
or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge
the liability for moneys payable upon any such Pass
Through Certificate.

SECTION 6.04. Pass Through Certificates
Owned by the Company and Related Owner Trustees Deemed
Not Outstanding. In determining whether the
Certificateholders of the requisite aggregate
Fractional Undivided Interest of Pass Through
Certificates of any Series have concurred in any
direction, consent or waiver under this Pass Through
Agreement, Pass Through Certificates of such Series
that are owned by the Company, any Related Owner
Trustee or Related Owner Participant or any obligor on
such Pass Through Certificates or by any Affiliate of
the Company, any such Related Owner Trustee or Related
Owner Participant or any obligor on such Pass Through
Certificates shall be disregarded and deemed not to be
Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination;
provided that for the purpose of determining whether
the Pass Through Trustee shall be protected in relying
on any such direction, consent or waiver, only if a
Responsible Officer of the Pass Through Trustee has
actual knowledge that certain Pass Through
Certificates are so owned shall such Pass Through
Certificates be so disregarded; and provided further
that if all Pass Through Certificates of such Series
that would be deemed Outstanding in the absence of the
foregoing provision are owned by the Company, any
Related Owner Trustee or Related Owner Participant or
any obligor on such Pass Through Certificates or by
any Affiliate of the Company, any such Related Owner
Trustee or Related Owner Participant or any obligor on
such Pass Through Certificates, then such Pass Through
Certificates shall be deemed Outstanding for the
purpose of any such determination. Pass Through
Certificates so owned that have been pledged in good
faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee
establishes to the satisfaction of the Pass Through
Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to
such Pass Through Certificates and that the pledgee is
not the Company, any Related Owner Trustee or Related
Owner Participant or any obligor upon the Pass Through
Certificates or any Affiliate of the Company, any
Related Owner Trustee or Related Owner Participant or
any obligor on such Pass Through Certificates. In
case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of
counsel shall be full protection in respect of any
decision made by the Pass Through Trustee in
accordance with such advice. For any Series, upon
request of the Pass Through Trustee, the Company, the
Related Owner Trustees and the Related Owner
Participants shall furnish to the Pass Through Trustee
promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and
identifying all Pass Through Certificates of such
Series, if any, known by the Company or any such
Related Owner Trustee or Related Owner Participant to
be owned or held by or for the account of any of the
above-described persons; and the Pass Through Trustee
shall be entitled to accept such Officers'
Certificates as conclusive evidence of the facts set
forth therein and of the fact that all Pass Through
Certificates of such Series not listed therein are
Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
For the purpose of determining whether Pass Through
Certificates of a Series are Outstanding as described
in this Section, an "obligor" on such Pass Through
Certificates shall include any obligor or any
Affiliate of any such obligor on any Equipment Trust
Certificates that constitute Trust Property of the
related Pass Through Trust.

SECTION 6.05. Right of Revocation of Action
Taken. For any Series, at any time prior to (but not
after) the evidencing to the Pass Through Trustee, as
provided in Section 6.01, of any action taken by the
related Certificateholders of the percentage in
aggregate of Fractional Undivided Interests in the
related Pass Through Trust specified in this Pass
Through Agreement in connection with such action, any
Certificateholder of a Pass Through Certificate of
such Series, the serial number of which is shown by
the evidence to be included among the serial numbers
of the Pass Through Certificates of such Series, the
Certificateholders of which have consented to such
action, may, by filing written notice at the Corporate
Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in
this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns
such Pass Through Certificate. Except as aforesaid,
any such action taken shall be conclusive and binding
upon such Certificateholder for such Pass Through
Certificate and upon all future Certificateholders and
owners of such Pass Through Certificate and of any
Pass Through Certificates issued in exchange or
substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not
any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such
Pass Through Certificate or otherwise. Any action
taken by such Certificateholders of the percentage in
aggregate of Fractional Undivided Interests in the
related Pass Through Trust specified in this Pass
Through Agreement in connection with such action shall
be conclusively binding upon the Pass Through Trustee
and all the Certificateholders of such Series.

SECTION 6.06. ERISA Plan Prohibition.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Series
Supplement, no employee benefit plan subject to Title
I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or individual retirement
account or plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code
(hereinafter collectively referred to as an "ERISA
Plan"), may acquire or hold any of the Pass Through
Certificates. The purchase by any person of any Pass
Through Certificate constitutes a representation by
such person to the Company, the Related Owner
Participants, the Related Owner Trustees, the Related
Indenture Trustees and the Pass Through Trustee that
such person is not an ERISA Plan and that such person
is not acquiring, and has not acquired, such Pass
Through Certificate with assets of an ERISA Plan.

ARTICLE VII

REMEDIES OF PASS THROUGH TRUSTEE
AND CERTIFICATEHOLDERS

SECTION 7.01. Events of Default. If, for
any Pass Through Trust, an Indenture Event of Default
under an Indenture relating to any Equipment Trust
Certificate that constitutes Trust Property of such
Pass Through Trust (an "Event of Default") shall occur
and be continuing, then, and in each and every case,
the Pass Through Trustee may vote all of the Equipment
Trust Certificates under such Indenture held by such
Pass Through Trust, and upon the direction of the
Majority In Interest of Certificateholders of the
related Series, the Pass Through Trustee shall vote a
corresponding majority of such Equipment Trust
Certificates in favor of directing the applicable
Related Indenture Trustee to declare the unpaid
principal of such Equipment Trust Certificates then
outstanding, together with interest accrued but unpaid
thereon and all other amounts due under such Equipment
Trust Certificates and the related Indenture, to be
due and payable under, and in accordance with the
provisions of, such Indenture. In addition, if such
Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Pass Through Trustee may in accordance
with such related Indenture vote such Equipment Trust
Certificates to direct the applicable Related
Indenture Trustee regarding the exercise of remedies
provided in such Indenture.

If, for any Pass Through Trust, an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Pass Through Trustee also may in its discretion, and
upon the direction of the Majority In Interest of
Certificateholders of the related Series shall, by
such officer or agent as it may appoint, sell, convey,
transfer and deliver any Equipment Trust Certificates
held in such Pass Through Trust that are subject to
the corresponding Indenture Event of Default, without
recourse to or warranty by the Pass Through Trustee or
any Certificateholder of such Series, to any Person.
In any such case, the Pass Through Trustee shall sell,
assign, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of and
deliver any such Equipment Trust Certificates in one
or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at
any location or locations at the option of the Pass
Through Trustee, all upon such terms and conditions as
it may reasonably deem advisable and at such prices as
it may reasonably deem advisable, for cash. If the
Pass Through Trustee so decides or is required to sell
or otherwise dispose of any Equipment Trust
Certificates pursuant to this Section, the Pass
Through Trustee shall take such of the actions
described above as it may reasonably deem most
effective to complete the sale or other disposition of
such Equipment Trust Certificates, so as to provide
for the payment in full of all amounts due on such
Equipment Trust Certificates with respect to the
related Series. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
action taken by the Pass Through Trustee under this
Section shall not, in the reasonable judgment of the
Pass Through Trustee, be adverse to the best interests
of the Certificateholders of such Series.

SECTION 7.02. Incidents of Sale of Equipment
Trust Certificates. Upon any sale of all or any part
of the Equipment Trust Certificates held in any Pass
Through Trust made either under the power of sale
given under this Pass Through Agreement or the related
Series Supplement or otherwise for the enforcement of
this Pass Through Agreement and the related Series
Supplement, the following shall be applicable:

(1) Any Certificateholder of the related
Series, the Pass Through Trustee in its
individual or any other capacity or any other
Person may bid for and purchase any of such
Equipment Trust Certificates, and upon compliance
with the terms of sale, may hold, retain, possess
and dispose of such Equipment Trust Certificates
in its or their own absolute right without
further accountability.

(2) The receipt of the Pass Through Trustee
or of the officer making such sale shall be a
sufficient discharge to any purchaser for his
purchase money, and, after paying such purchase
money and receiving such receipt, such purchaser
or its personal representative or assigns shall
not be obliged to see to the application of such
purchase money, or be in any way answerable for
any loss, misapplication or non-application
thereof.

(3) Any moneys collected by the Pass Through
Trustee upon any sale made either under the power
of sale given by this Pass Through Agreement or
the related Series Supplement or otherwise for
the enforcement of the related Pass Through
Trust, shall be deposited and distributed as a
Special Payment as provided in Article V.

SECTION 7.03. Pass Through Trustee May Prove
Debt. If any amount payable under any Equipment Trust
Certificate held by any Pass Through Trust is not paid
when due and payable, the Pass Through Trustee, in its
own name and as trustee of an express trust, as holder
of such Equipment Trust Certificate shall be, to the
extent permitted by and in accordance with the terms
of the related Indenture Documents, entitled and
empowered to institute any action or proceedings at
law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due
and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or
proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce any such judgment or final decree against the
applicable Owner Trustee or other obligor upon such
Equipment Trust Certificate and collect in the manner
provided by law out of the property of such Owner
Trustee or such other obligor upon such Equipment
Trust Certificate, as the case may be, wherever
situated, the moneys adjudged or decreed to be
payable.

All rights of action and of asserting claims
under this Pass Through Agreement, or under any of the
Pass Through Certificates, may be prosecuted and
enforced by the Pass Through Trustee without the
possession of any of such Pass Through Certificates or
the production thereof in any trial or other
proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or
proceedings instituted by the Pass Through Trustee
shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an
express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject
to the payment of the expenses, disbursements and
compensation of the Pass Through Trustee, each
predecessor Pass Through Trustee and their respective
agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit
of the Certificateholders of the related Series.

In any proceedings brought by the Pass
Through Trustee (and also any proceedings involving
the interpretation of any provision of this Pass
Through Agreement or any Series Supplement to which
the Pass Through Trustee shall be a party) the Pass
Through Trustee shall be held to represent all the
Certificateholders of the related Series, and it shall
not be necessary to make any such Certificateholders
parties to any such proceedings.

SECTION 7.04. Remedies Cumulative. Each and
every right, power and remedy given to the Pass
Through Trustee specifically or otherwise under any
Pass Through Trust shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other right, power and remedy
specifically given thereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each and
every right, power and remedy whether specifically
given thereunder or otherwise existing may be
exercised from time to time and as often and in such
order as may be deemed expedient by the Pass Through
Trustee or the Certificateholders of the related
Series, and the exercise or the beginning of the
exercise of any power or remedy shall not be construed
to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same
time or thereafter any other right, power or remedy.
No delay or omission by the Pass Through Trustee or of
any such Certificateholder in the exercise of any
right, remedy or power or in the pursuance of any
remedy shall impair any such right, power or remedy or
be construed to be a waiver of any default on the part
of the applicable Owner Trustee, or to be an
acquiescence therein.

SECTION 7.05. Suits for Enforcement. If an
Indenture Event of Default has occurred, has not been
waived and is continuing, the Pass Through Trustee may
in its discretion and subject to its rights of
appropriate indemnification under Sections 7.07 and
8.03 and Article IX hereof, to the extent permitted by
and in accordance with the Indenture Documents,
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and rights
of the Certificateholders of the related Series by
such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Pass
Through Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect
and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in
equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the
specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement
under the related Pass Through Trust or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted thereunder or to enforce
any other legal or equitable right vested in the Pass
Through Trustee or the Certificateholders under such
Pass Through Trust or by law; provided that any sale
of any portion of the related Trust Property shall be
done in accordance with Section 7.02.

SECTION 7.06. Discontinuance of Proceedings.
If the Pass Through Trustee or any Certificateholder
of any Series institutes any proceeding to enforce any
right, power or remedy under the related Pass Through
Trust, and such proceeding is discontinued or
abandoned for any reason or is determined adversely to
the Pass Through Trustee or such Certificateholder,
then and in every such case the applicable Owner
Trustee, and the applicable Indenture Trustee, the
Pass Through Trustee, the Certificateholders of such
Series and the Company shall, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, be restored to their
former positions and rights under such Pass Through
Trust with respect to the Trust Property and all
rights, remedies and powers of the Pass Through
Trustee and such Certificateholders shall continue as
if no such proceeding had been instituted.

SECTION 7.07. Limitations on Suits by
Certificateholders. No Certificateholder of any
Series shall have any right by virtue or by availing
of any provision of the related Pass Through Trust to
institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity
or in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with
respect to such Pass Through Trust, or for the
appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator,
custodian or other similar official or for any other
remedy thereunder, unless such Certificateholder
previously has notified the Pass Through Trustee in
writing of an Event of Default under such Pass Through
Trust and of the continuance thereof, as provided
herein, and the Certificateholders of the related Pass
Through Certificates then Outstanding (or the proxy
therefor) representing in the aggregate not less than
25% of the Fractional Undivided Interests of Pass
Through Certificates then Outstanding under such Pass
Through Trust have requested in writing that the Pass
Through Trustee institute such action or proceedings
in its own name as trustee under such Pass Through
Trust and have offered to the Pass Through Trustee
such reasonable indemnity as it may require against
the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred
therein or thereby, and the Pass Through Trustee for
60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and
offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
action or proceedings and no direction inconsistent
with such written request has been given to the Pass
Through Trustee pursuant to Section 7.10; it being
understood and intended, and being expressly
covenanted by such Certificateholder with every other
Certificateholder of such Series and the Pass Through
Trustee, that no one or more Certificateholders of
such Series shall have any right in any manner
whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of
any other Certificateholder of such Series or to
obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference
to any other Certificateholder of such Series or to
enforce any right under the related Pass Through
Trust, except in the manner provided therein and for
the equal, ratable and common benefit of all
Certificateholders of such Series. For the protection
and enforcement of the provisions of this Section,
each and every Certificateholder of the related Series
and the Pass Through Trustee shall be entitled to such
relief as can be given either at law or in equity.

SECTION 7.08. Unconditional Right of
Certificateholders to Receive Principal, Interest and
Premium, and to Institute Certain Suits. Nothwithstanding
any other provision in this Pass Through Agreement, any
Series Supplement or any Pass Through Certificate issued
pursuant to such Series Supplement, the right of any
Certificateholder of the related Series to receive
distributions on such Pass Through Certificate of Scheduled
Payments or Special Payments pursuant to Article V on or
after the respective due dates set forth in such Series
Supplement, or, subject to Section 7.07, to institute
suit for the enforcement of any such distribution on
or after such respective dates as provided herein or
therein, shall not be impaired or affected without the
consent of such Certificateholder. The purchase by
any Certificateholder of any Pass Through Certificate
constitutes the consent of such Certificateholder to
the retention by the Pass Through Trustee of certain
amounts otherwise distributable to such
Certificateholder in accordance with Section 5.05.

SECTION 7.09. Control by Certificateholders.
A Majority In Interest of Certificateholders of any
Series has the right with respect to the related Pass
Through Trust to direct the Pass Through Trustee as to
the time, method, and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Pass
Through Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Pass Through Trustee under such Pass
Through Trust; provided that such direction is not
otherwise than in accordance with law and the
provisions of such Pass Through Trust and the Pass
Through Trustee has received, to the extent provided
in Sections 7.07 and 8.03 and Article IX hereof, such
reasonable indemnification as it may require against
the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred by
the Pass Through Trustee; and provided further that
the Pass Through Trustee has the right to decline to
follow any such direction if the Pass Through Trustee,
being advised by counsel, determines that the action
or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or
if the Pass Through Trustee in good faith by its board
of directors, the executive committee, or a trust
committee of directors or Responsible Officers of the
Pass Through Trustee determines that the action or
proceedings so directed would involve the Pass Through
Trustee in personal liability or if the Pass Through
Trustee in good faith so determines that the actions
or forebearances specified in or pursuant to such
direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interests
of the Certificateholders of such Series not joining
in the giving of said direction, it being understood
that the Pass Through Trustee shall have no duty to
ascertain whether or not such actions or forebearances
are unduly prejudicial to such Certificateholders.

Nothing in this Pass Through Agreement or any
Series Supplement shall impair the right of the Pass
Through Trustee in its discretion to take any action
deemed proper by the Pass Through Trustee with respect
to the related Pass Through Trust and which is not
inconsistent with such direction by Certificateholders
of the related Series.

SECTION 7.10. Waiver of Past Events of
Default. Upon written instructions from a Majority in
Interest of Certificateholders of any Series, the Pass
Through Trustee shall waive any past Event of Default
under the related Pass Through Trust and its
consequences and upon such waiver such Event of
Default will cease to exist and any Event of Default
arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured
for every purpose of such Pass Through Trust, but no
such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other
Event of Default thereunder or impair any right
consequent thereon; provided that any such waiver will
be effective to waive any such past Event of Default
and its consequences as described above if, but only
if, the correlative Indenture Event of Default has
been waived under the related Indenture by the
requisite holders of the Equipment Trust Certificates
outstanding thereunder; and provided further that in
the absence of written instructions from all
Certificateholders of any Series (or the proxy
therefor), the Pass Through Trustee shall not waive
any Event of Default (i) consisting of the failure to
pay any principal of, or premium (if any), or interest
on, or other amounts due under, any Equipment Trust
Certificate held by the related Pass Through Trust and
the consequent failure to distribute any related
Scheduled Payment or Special Payment pursuant to
Article V on or after the respective due date therefor
set forth in the related Series Supplement or (ii) in
respect of a covenant or provision under any Pass
Through Trust that, under Article XI hereof or the
related Series Supplement, cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of each Certificateholder
of the related Series (or the proxy therefor).

SECTION 7.11. Notice of Pass Through
Defaults. The Pass Through Trustee shall, in the
manner and to the extent required by Section 313(c) of
the Trust Indenture Act, notify the Certificateholders
of any Series of all Pass Through Defaults under the
related Pass Through Trust actually known to a
Responsible Officer of the Pass Through Trustee,
unless such Pass Through Defaults have been cured
before the giving of such notice; provided that under
no circumstances shall the Pass Through Trustee give
such notice until the earlier of the time at which
such Pass Through Default becomes an Event of Default
or the expiration of a period of 60 days from the
occurrence of such Pass Through Default; and provided
further that, except in the case of the failure to pay
any principal of or interest on or any other amount
due under any of the Equipment Trust Certificates held
by any Pass Through Trust and the consequent failure
to distribute any related Scheduled Payment or Special
Payment pursuant to Article V on or after the
respective due date therefor set forth in the related
Series Supplement, the Pass Through Trustee shall be
protected in withholding such notice if and so long as
the board of directors, the executive committee, or a
trust committee of directors or trustees or
Responsible Officers of the Pass Through Trustee in
good faith determines that the withholding of such
notice is in the interests of the Certificateholders
of the related Series.

ARTICLE VIII

CONCERNING THE PASS THROUGH TRUSTEE

SECTION 8.01. Acceptance by Pass Through
Trustee. The Pass Through Trustee, upon the execution
and delivery of a Series Supplement creating a Pass
Through Trust and providing for the issuance of a
Series of Pass Through Certificates, shall acknowledge
its acceptance of all right, title and interest in and
to the Equipment Trust Certificates to be acquired as
Trust Property of such Pass Through Trust pursuant to
the applicable Participation Agreements and Section
2.02, and shall declare that the Pass Through Trustee
holds and will hold such right, title, and interest,

Trust Property of such Pass Through Trust, for the
benefit of all then present and future
Certificateholders of such Series, upon the trusts set
forth in such Pass Through Trust.

SECTION 8.02. Pass Through Trustee's Liens.
The Pass Through Trustee agrees that it will, in its
individual capacity and at its own cost and expense
(but without any right of indemnity in respect of any
such cost or expense under Article IX hereof) promptly
take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge
all Liens on any part of the Trust Property of any
Pass Through Trust that result from claims against it
in its individual capacity not related to the
administration of such Trust Property or any other
transaction pursuant to this Pass Through Agreement or
the related Series Supplement.

SECTION 8.03. Certain Rights of the Pass
Through Trustee. Subject to Section 315 of the Trust

opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
bond, debenture, note, coupon, security or other
paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties;

(b) any request of any Related Indenture
Trustee or Related Owner Trustee in connection

evidenced by an Officers' Certificate (unless
other evidence in respect thereof is specifically
prescribed herein) upon which the Pass Through
Trustee may rely to prove or establish a matter
set forth therein;

(c) the Pass Through Trustee may consult
with counsel and any advice or Opinion of Counsel
shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with such advice
or Opinion of Counsel;

(d) the Pass Through Trustee shall not be
obligated to exercise any of the trusts or powers
vested in it under any Pass Through Trust at the

Through Trustee reasonable security or indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which

(e) the Pass Through Trustee shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it in
good faith and believed by it to be authorized or

upon it under any Pass Through Trust;

(f) prior to the occurrence of an Event of
Default under any Pass Through Trust and after
the curing or waiving of all Events of Default

request, consent, order, approval, appraisal,
bond, debenture, note, coupon, security, or other

do so by the Majority in Interest of
Certificateholders of the related Series;
provided that if the payment within a reasonable
time to the Pass Through Trustee of the costs,
expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by
it in the making of such investigation is, in the
opinion of the Pass Through Trustee, not
reasonably assured to the Pass Through Trustee by
the security afforded to it by the terms of such
Pass Through Trust, the Pass Through Trustee may
require reasonable indemnity against such
expenses or liabilities as a condition to
proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such
examination shall be paid by the Company or, if
paid by the Pass Through Trustee or any
predecessor trustee, shall be repaid by the
Company upon demand;

(g) the Pass Through Trustee may execute any
of the trusts or powers under any Pass Through

agent or attorney appointed by it with due care;
and

(h) the Pass Through Trustee shall not be
required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur personal financial liability in
the performance of any of its duties or in the
exercise of any of its rights or powers under any
Pass Through Trust, if the Pass Through Trustee
has determined in good faith that the repayment
of such funds or adequate indemnity against such
liability is not reasonably assured to it.

SECTION 8.04. Pass Through Trustee Not
Responsible for Recitals. The Pass Through Trustee
assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the
recitals contained herein or in any Pass Through
Certificates, except for the execution and
authentication of such Pass Through Certificates by
the Pass Through Trustee in accordance with Section

SECTION 8.05. Pass Through Trustee and
Agents May Hold Pass Through Certificates;
Collections. The Pass Through Trustee and any agent
of the Pass Through Trustee, in its individual or any
other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of

such agent and, subject to the applicable provisions
of the Trust Indenture Act, may otherwise deal with
the Company, any Related Indenture Trustee or Related
Owner Trustee and receive, collect, hold and retain
collections therefrom with the same rights it would
have if it were not the Pass Through Trustee or such
agent.

SECTION 8.06. Moneys Held by Pass Through
Trustee. Subject to Sections 5.04 and 12.04 hereof,
all moneys received by the Pass Through Trustee shall,
until used or applied as provided herein, be held in
trust for the purposes for which they were received,
but need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent required by mandatory provisions of law.
Subject to Section 5.04, neither the Pass Through
Trustee nor any agent thereof shall be under any
liability for interest on any moneys received by it
hereunder.

SECTION 8.07. Right of Pass Through Trustee
to Rely on Officers' Certificate. Subject to Section
8.03, whenever in the administration of any Pass
Through Trust the Pass Through Trustee shall deem it
necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or
established prior to taking or suffering or omitting
any action thereunder, such matter (unless other
evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed
herein) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part
of the Pass Through Trustee, be deemed to be
conclusively proved and established by an Officers'
Certificate delivered to the Pass Through Trustee by
the Company, any Related Indenture Trustee or any
Related Owner Trustee, as the case may be, and such
certificate, in the absence of bad faith on the part
of the Pass Through Trustee, shall be full warrant to
the Pass Through Trustee for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this
Pass Through Agreement upon the faith thereof.

SECTION 8.08. Compensation. The Company
covenants and agrees to pay, and the Pass Through
Trustee shall be entitled to receive, reasonable
compensation and payment or reimbursement for its
reasonable advances, expenses and disbursements
(including the reasonable compensation and expenses
and disbursements of its counsel, agents and other
persons not regularly in its employ) in connection
with its services rendered hereunder or in any way
relating to or arising out of the administration of
any Pass Through Trust or the related Trust Property,
except any such advance, expense or disbursement
attributable to the Pass Through Trustee's negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith or incurred as a
result of the breach of its representation and
covenant set forth in Section 8.02, and shall have a
priority claim on such Trust Property for the payment
of such compensation, advances, expenses and
disbursements to the extent that such compensation,
advances, expenses and disbursements shall not be paid
by the Company.

In addition, the Pass Through Trustee shall
be entitled to reimbursement from, and shall have a
priority claim on, all property and funds held or
collected by the Pass Through Trustee with respect to
any Series or the related Pass Through Trust in its
capacity as Pass Through Trustee for any tax incurred

its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of such Pass Through
Trust (other than any tax attributable to the Pass
Through Trustee's compensation for serving as such),
including any costs and expenses incurred in
contesting the imposition of any such tax. If the
Pass Through Trustee reimburses itself from the Trust
Property of such Pass Through Trust for any such tax
it shall within 30 days mail a brief report setting

Certificateholders of the related Series as their
names and addresses appear in the related Register.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION OF
PASS THROUGH TRUSTEE BY THE COMPANY

The Company hereby agrees, whether or not any
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, to assume liability for, and does hereby
indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless the Pass
Through Trustee, in its individual capacity, and its
successors, assigns, agents and servants, with respect
to the claims of the Pass Through Trustee for payment
or reimbursement under Section 8.08 and from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, taxes (excluding any taxes payable
by the Pass Through Trustee on or measured by any
compensation received by the Pass Through Trustee for
its services under this Pass Through Agreement,
claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements (including legal fees and expenses) of
any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Pass Through
Trustee in its individual capacity (whether or not
also agreed to be indemnified against by any other
Person under any other document) in any way relating
to or arising out of this Pass Through Agreement, or
any Series Supplement or the enforcement of any of the
terms of any thereof, or in any way relating to or
arising out of the administration of any Pass Through
Trust or the related Trust Property or the action or
inaction of the Pass Through Trustee hereunder, except
only (i) in the case of negligence, willful misconduct
or bad faith of the Pass Through Trustee in the
performance of its duties hereunder or under any
Series Supplement, (ii) as may result from the
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the

indemnification, from the related Trust Property, for
any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty,
claim, action, suit, cost, expense or disbursement
indemnified against pursuant to this Article IX to the
extent not reimbursed by the Company or others, but
without releasing any of them from their respective
agreements of reimbursement; and to secure the same,
the Pass Through Trustee shall have a prior Lien on
such Trust Property. The indemnities contained in
this Article IX shall survive the termination of this
Pass Through Agreement or any Pass Through Trust and
the resignation or removal of the Pass Through Trustee
hereunder or thereunder.

SUCCESSOR TRUSTEES

SECTION 10.01. Resignation and Removal of
Pass Through Trustee; Appointment of Successor. (a)
The Pass Through Trustee may resign at any time as
trustee of any Pass Through Trust without cause by
giving at least 30 days prior written notice to the
Company, the Related Indenture Trustees and the
Related Owner Trustees, such resignation to be
effective upon the acceptance of the trusteeship by a
successor Pass Through Trustee. In addition, a
Majority in Interest of Certificateholders of any
Series may at any time remove the related Pass Through
Trustee without cause by an instrument in writing
delivered to the Company, the Related Owner Trustees,
the Related Indenture Trustees and the Pass Through
Trustee, and the Pass Through Trustee shall promptly
notify each Certificateholder of such Series of such
removal in writing, such removal to be effective upon
the acceptance of the trusteeship by a successor Pass
Through Trustee. In the case of the resignation or
removal of the Pass Through Trustee, a Majority in
Interest of Certificateholders of the related Series
may appoint a successor Pass Through Trustee by an
instrument signed by such Certificateholders. If a
successor Pass Through Trustee shall not have been
appointed within 90 days after such notice of
resignation or removal, the Pass Through Trustee, the
Company or any Certificateholder of the related Series
may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor Pass Through Trustee to act until
such time, if any, as a successor shall have been
appointed as provided above. The successor Pass
Through Trustee so appointed by such court shall
immediately and without further act be superseded by
any successor Pass Through Trustee appointed as
provided above within one year from the date of the
appointment by such court.

(b) If at any time any of the following
occurs with respect to any Pass Through Trust:

(i) the Pass Through Trustee fails to comply
with the requirements of Section 310 of the Trust
Indenture Act after written request for such
compliance by any Certificateholder of the
related Series who has been a bona fide
Certificateholder of such Series for at least six
months; or

(ii) the Pass Through Trustee ceases to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.02 to act as trustee for such Pass
Through Trust and fails to resign after written
request for such resignation by the Company or by
any such bona fide Certificateholder; or

(iii) the Pass Through Trustee becomes
incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or
liquidator of the Pass Through Trustee or of its
property shall be appointed, or any public
officer takes charge or control of the Pass
Through Trustee or of its property or affairs for
the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation;

then the Company may remove the Pass Through Trustee
and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument,
in duplicate, executed by a Responsible Officer of the
Company, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to the Pass Through Trustee so removed and
one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the
provisions of Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture
Act, any Certificateholder of the related Series who
has been a bona fide Certificateholder of such Series
for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and
all others similarly situated, petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Pass
Through Trustee and the appointment of a successor
trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice,
if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove
the Pass Through Trustee and appoint a successor
trustee, which removal and appointment shall become
effective upon acceptance of appointment by the
successor trustee as provided in Section 10.03. The
successor Pass Through Trustee so appointed by such
court shall immediately and without further act be
superseded by any successor Pass Through Trustee
appointed by the Certificateholders of the related
Series as provided in subsection (a) above within one
year from the date of appointment by such court.

SECTION 10.02. Persons Eligible for
Appointment as Pass Through Trustee. Each Pass
Through Trust shall at all times have a Pass Through
Trustee which shall be a Person eligible to act as
trustee under Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture
Act and shall be a corporation organized and doing
business under the laws of the United States of
America or of any State or the District of Columbia
having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$100,000,000, or a direct or indirect subsidiary of
such a corporation, or a member of a bank holding
company group, having a combined capital and surplus
of at least $100,000,000 and such subsidiary or member
itself having a capital and surplus of at least
$10,000,000, which corporate trustee shall be a
citizen of the United States as defined in Section
101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
amended, and which is authorized under such laws to
exercise corporate trust powers and is subject to
supervision of examination by Federal, State or
District of Columbia authority. If such corporation
publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of the
aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for
the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and
surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most
recent report of condition so published. If at any
time the Pass Through Trustee ceases to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section to act
as trustee for any Pass Through Trust, the Pass
Through Trustee shall resign immediately as Pass
Through Trustee for such Pass Through Trust in the
manner and with the effect specified in Section 10.01.

SECTION 10.03. Acceptance of Appointment by
Successor Trustee. Any successor trustee appointed as
provided in Section 10.01 for any Pass Through Trust
shall execute and deliver to the Company and to its
predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment with respect to such Pass Through Trust,
and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor trustee shall become effective and such
successor trustee, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become vested with all rights,
powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor with
respect to such Pass Through Trust, as if such
successor trustee was originally named as trustee of
such Pass Through Trust. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, on the written request of the Company or
the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act
shall, upon payment of its charges then unpaid and
subject to Section 12.04, pay over to the successor
trustee all moneys at the time held by it with respect
to such Pass Through Trust and shall execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor
trustee all such rights, powers, duties and
obligations. Upon request of any such successor
trustee, the Company shall execute any and all
instruments in writing for more fully and certainly
vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee
all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to
act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all
property or funds held or collected by such trustee
with respect to such Pass Through Trust to secure any
amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of
Article IX.

If a successor trustee is appointed with
respect to all the Pass Through Trusts created
pursuant to this Pass Through Agreement, a supplement
to this Pass Through Agreement executed and delivered
by the Company, the predecessor trustee and the
successor trustee shall be sufficient with respect to
each such Pass Through Trust to effect the removal of
the predecessor trustee and to vest the successor
trustee all rights, powers, duties and obligations of
its predecessor under each such Pass Through Trust, as
if such successor trustee was originally named as Pass
Through Trustee hereunder and thereunder.

No successor trustee shall accept appointment
as provided in this Section unless at the time of such
acceptance such successor trustee shall be eligible
under the provisions of Section 10.02 to act as
trustee of the relevant Pass Through Trust.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor
trustee as provided in this Section, the successor
trustee shall notify the Certificateholders of the
related Series of such appointment by first-class mail
at their last addresses as they shall appear in the
Register, and shall mail a copy of such notice to the
Company, the Related Indenture Trustees and the
Related Owner Trustees, if any. If the acceptance of
appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the
resignation, then the notice called for by the
preceding sentence may be combined with the notice
called for by Section 10.01.

SECTION 10.04. Merger, Conversion,
Consolidation or Succession to Business of Pass
Through Trustee. Any corporation into which the Pass
Through Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation
to which the Pass Through Trustee is a party, or any
corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business
of the Pass Through Trustee, shall be the successor to
the Pass Through Trustee hereunder, provided that,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, such
corporation shall be eligible under the provisions of
Section 10.02 to act as trustee hereunder, without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto.

If, with respect to any Pass Through Trusts
at the time of such succession to the Pass Through
Trustee, any of the Pass Through Certificates of the
related Series have been authenticated but not
delivered, such successor may adopt the certificate of
authentication of any such predecessor Pass Through
Trustee and deliver such Pass Through Certificates so
authenticated; and, if at that time any of such Pass
Through Certificates have not been authenticated, such
successor may authenticate such Pass Through
Certificates either in the name of any of its
predecessor or in its own name as the successor Pass
Through Trustee; and in all such cases such
certificate of authentication shall have the full
force of the certificate of authentication of the Pass
Through Trustee set forth in Section 2.01; provided
that the right to adopt the certificate of
authentication of any predecessor Pass Through Trustee
or to authenticate Pass Through Certificates in the
name of any predecessor Pass Through Trustee shall
apply only to its successor or successors by merger,
conversion or consolidation.

SECTION 10.05. Appointment of Separate Pass
Through Trustees. (a) At any time or times, for the
purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any
jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property
of any Pass Through Trust may at the time be located
or in which any action of the Pass Through Trustee may
be required to be performed or taken, the Pass Through
Trustee, by an instrument in writing signed by it, may
appoint one or more individuals or corporations to act
as separate trustee or separate trustees or
co-trustee, acting jointly with the Pass Through
Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, to
the full extent that local law makes it necessary for
such separate trustee or separate trustees or
co-trustee, acting jointly with the Pass Through
Trustee, to act.

(b) The Pass Through Trustee and, at the
request of the Pass Through Trustee, the Company,
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
instruments as may be required by the legal
requirements of any jurisdiction or by any such
separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee
for the purpose of more fully confirming such title,
rights or duties to such separate trustee or separate
trustees or co-trustee. Upon the acceptance in
writing of such appointment by any such separate
trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee, it, he,
she or they shall be vested with such title to such
Trust Property or any part thereof, and with such
rights, powers, duties and obligations, as shall be
specified in the instrument of appointment, and such
rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be
conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed
by the Pass Through Trustee, or the Pass Through
Trustee and such separate trustee or separate trustees
or co-trustee jointly with the Pass Through Trustee
subject to all the terms of this Pass Through
Agreement, except to the extent that under any law of
any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts
are to be performed the Pass Through Trustee shall be
incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or
acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
obligations shall be exercised and performed by such
separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee,
as the case may be. Any separate trustee or separate
trustees or co-trustee may, at any time by an
instrument in writing, constitute the Pass Through
Trustee its, her or his attorney-in-fact and agent
with full power and authority to do all acts and
things and to exercise all discretion on its, her or
his behalf and in its, her or his name. In case any
such separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, the title
to any Trust Property and all assets, property,
rights, powers, duties and obligations of such
separate trustee or co-trustee shall, so far as
permitted by law, vest in and be exercised by the Pass
Through Trustee, without the appointment of a
successor to such separate trustee or co-trustee
unless and until a successor is appointed.

(c) All provisions of this Pass Through
Agreement which are for the benefit of the Pass
Through Trustee (including without limitation Article
IX hereof) shall extend to and apply to each separate
trustee or co-trustee appointed pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 10.06.

(d) For any Pass Through Trust, every
additional trustee and separate trustee hereunder
shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed
and act and the Pass Through Trustee shall act,
subject to the following provisions and conditions:

(i) all powers, duties, obligations and
rights conferred upon the Pass Through Trustee in
respect of the receipt, custody, investment and
payment of moneys shall be exercised solely by
the Pass Through Trustee;

(ii) all other rights, powers, duties and
obligations conferred or imposed upon the Pass
Through Trustee shall be conferred or imposed and
exercised or performed by the Pass Through
Trustee and such additional trustee or trustees
and separate trustee or trustees jointly except
to the extent that under any law of any
jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts
are to be performed, the Pass Through Trustee
shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
such act or acts, in which event such rights,
powers, duties and obligations (including the
holding of title to the Trust Property in any
such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and
performed by such additional trustee or trustees
or separate trustee or trustees;

(iii) no power hereby given to, or
exercisable by, any such additional trustee or
separate trustee shall be exercised hereunder by
such additional trustee or separate trustee
except jointly with, or with the consent of, the
Pass Through Trustee; and

(iv) no trustee hereunder shall be
personally liable by reason of any act or
omission of any other trustee hereunder.

If at any time the Pass Through Trustee shall deem it
no longer necessary or prudent in order to conform to
any such law, the Pass Through Trustee shall execute
and deliver all instruments and agreements necessary
or proper to remove any additional trustee or separate
trustee.

(e) Any request, approval or consent in
writing by the Pass Through Trustee to any additional
trustee or separate trustee shall be sufficient
warrant to such additional trustee or separate
trustee, as the case may be, to take such action as
may be so requested, approved or consented to.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 10.06, the powers of any additional
trustee or separate trustee shall not exceed those of
the Pass Through Trustee hereunder.

Any supplemental agreement contemplated by
this Section may be executed without the consent of
the Certificateholders of the Outstanding Pass Through

Trust to become taxable as an association within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4; and
provided further that, without the consent of each
Certificateholder of such Series (or the proxy
therefor), no such amendment of or supplement to this
Pass Through Agreement or such related Series

Through Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not
be obligated to, enter into such supplemental
agreement.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of
the Certificateholders of any Series under this
Section to approve the particular form of any proposed
supplemental agreement, but it shall be sufficient if
such consent shall approve the substance thereof.

Promptly after the execution by the Company
and the Pass Through Trustee of any supplemental
agreement relating to any Pass Through Trust pursuant
to the provisions of this Section, the Pass Through
Trustee shall mail a notice thereof by first-class
mail to the related Certificateholders at their
addresses as they shall appear on the related
Register, setting forth in general terms the substance

Pass Through Trustee to mail such notice, or any
defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair
or affect the validity of any such supplemental
agreement.

SECTION 11.03. Effect of Supplemental
Agreements. Upon the execution of any supplemental
agreement pursuant to the provisions hereof and of any
applicable Series Supplement, this Pass Through
Agreement and such Series Supplement shall be and be

provided for by such supplemental agreement. If the
Company or the Pass Through Trustee shall so
determine, new Pass Through Certificates for such
Series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of
the Company and the Pass Through Trustee, to any
modification of this Pass Through Agreement contained
in any such supplemental agreement may be provided by
the Company, executed and authenticated by the Pass
Through Trustee and delivered in exchange for the
Outstanding Pass Through Certificates of such Series.

SECTION 11.06. Trust Indenture Act. Any
supplemental agreement executed pursuant to the terms
of this Article shall on the date of the execution
thereof conform to the provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act as in force on such date.

SECTION 11.07. Revocation and Effect of
Consents. Until an amendment or waiver becomes
effective, a consent to it by a Certificateholder is a
continuing consent by such Certificateholder and every
subsequent Certificateholder of the related Pass
Through Certificate, even if notation of the consent
is not made on such Pass Through Certificate.
However, any such Certificateholder or subsequent
Certificateholder may revoke the consent as to his
Pass Through Certificate if the Pass Through Trustee
receives the notice of revocation before the date the
amendment or waiver becomes effective. After an
amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind
every Certificateholder affected by such amendment or
waiver.

SECTION 11.08. Amendments, Waivers, etc., of
Related Indenture Documents. If the Pass Through
Trustee, as holder of any Equipment Trust Certificate
in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders of
any Series, receives a request for a consent to any
modification, amendment or supplement to any related
Indenture or other related Indenture Document or to
give any consent, waiver, authorization or approval
under such related Indenture or such other related
Indenture Documents, the Pass Through Trustee shall
forthwith notify each Certificateholder of such
Series, as shown on the related Register as of such
date, of such request. Such notice shall request

to such request. Subject to Section 7.10, the Pass
Through Trustee shall, as the holder of such Equipment
Trust Certificate, consent or vote with respect
thereto in the same proportion as so instructed by the
respective Certificateholders of the related Pass
Through Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
but subject to Section 7.09, if an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pass
Through Trustee may, in its own discretion and at its
own direction, consent and notify the Related
Indenture Trustee of such consent to any modification,
amendment, supplement or waiver under any related
Indenture Document.

ARTICLE XII

UNCLAIMED MONEYS

SECTION 12.01. Termination of Pass Through
Trusts. For any Pass Through Trust, such Pass Through
Trust and the respective obligations and responsibilities

Pass Through Trust shall terminate upon the distribution
to all Certificateholders of the related Series and the Pass
Through Trustee of all amounts required to be distributed
to them pursuant to this Pass Through Agreement and the
related Series Supplement and the disposition of all
property held as part of the Trust Property of such Pass
Through Trust; provided that in no event shall such Pass
Through Trust continue beyond the final expiration
date determined as provided in such Series Supplement.

Notice of termination of any Pass Through
Trust, specifying the applicable Distribution Date
upon which the Certificateholders of the related
Series may surrender their Pass Through Certificates
to the Pass Through Trustee for payment of the final

promptly by the Pass Through Trustee to such
Certificateholders not earlier than the 60th day and
not later than the 20th day next preceding such final

such distribution will be made only upon presentation
and surrender of the related Pass Through Certificates
at the office or agency of the Pass Through Trustee
specified therein, (ii) the amount of any such final
distribution, and (iii) that the Record Date otherwise
applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable.
The Pass Through Trustee shall notify the related

amounts distributable on such Pass Through Certificates
on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 5.02.

SECTION 12.02. Application by Pass Through
Trustee of Funds Deposited for Payment of Pass Through

of the particular Pass Through Certificates for the
payment or redemption of which such moneys have been
deposited with the Pass Through Trustee, of all sums
due and to become due thereon; but such money need not
be segregated from other funds except to the extent

In the event that all of the

their Certificates for cancellation within six months
after the date specified in the above-mentioned

second written notice to the remaining
Certificateholders of such Series to surrender their
Certificates for cancellation and to receive the final
distribution with respect thereto.

SECTION 12.03. Repayment of Moneys Held by
Paying Agent. In connection with the satisfaction and
discharge of any Pass Through Trust, all moneys then
held by any Paying Agent for such Pass Through Trust
shall, upon demand of the Pass Through Trustee, be
repaid to it and thereupon such Paying Agent shall be
released from all further liability with respect to
such moneys.

SECTION 12.04. Transfer of Moneys Held by
Pass Through Trustee and Paying Agent Unclaimed for
Two Years and Eleven Months. Any moneys deposited
with or paid to the Pass Through Trustee or any Paying

unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of
applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property
law, be paid to the applicable Related Indenture
Trustees by the Pass Through Trustee or such Paying
Agent and the applicable Certificateholder shall,
unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of
applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property
laws, thereafter look only to such Related Indenture
Trustees for any payment which such Certificateholder

the Trust Property of the related Pass Through Trust.
No transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, of any

entitle such Certificateholder or any successor or
transferee of such Certificateholder to an accounting
or to the transfer to it of legal title to any part of
such Trust Property.

SECTION 13.03. Certificates Nonassessable
and Fully Paid. No Certificateholder of any Series
shall be personally liable for obligations of the
related Pass Through Trust, the Fractional Undivided
Interests represented by the Pass Through Certificates
of such Series shall be nonassessable for any losses
or expenses of such Pass Through Trust or for any
reason whatsoever, and upon authentication of such
Pass Through Certificates by the Pass Through Trustee
pursuant to Section 3.02, such Pass Through
Certificates will be and shall be deemed fully paid.
No Certificateholder of such Series shall have any
right (except as expressly provided herein) to vote or
in any manner otherwise control the operation and
management of the related Trust Property, the related
Pass Through Trust, or the obligations of the parties
hereto, nor shall anything set forth herein, in the
related Series Supplement or in the related Pass
Through Certificates be construed so as to constitute
the Certificateholders of such Series from time to
time as partners or members of an association.

SECTION 13.04. Pass Through Agreement for
the Benefit of the Company, the Pass Through Trustee
and the Certificateholders. Nothing in this Pass
Through Agreement, in any Series Supplement or in any
Pass Through Certificate, whether express or implied,
shall be construed to give to any person other than
the Company, the Pass Through Trustee, as trustee and
in its individual capacity, and the Certificateholders
of the respective related Series any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect
of this Pass Through Agreement, any Pass Through Trust
or any such Pass Through Certificate.

SECTION 13.05. Limitation on Rights of
Certificateholders. The death or incapacity of any
Certificateholder of any Series shall not operate to
terminate the related Pass Through Trust, nor entitle
such Certificateholder's legal representatives or
heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or
commence any proceeding in any court for a partition
or winding up of such Pass Through Trust, nor
otherwise affect the rights, obligations, and
liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them. No
Certificateholder of any Series shall be entitled to
revoke the related Pass Through Trust.

SECTION 13.06. Notices. Unless otherwise
expressly specified or permitted by the terms hereof,
all notices, requests, demands, authorizations,
directions, consents, waivers or documents provided or
permitted by this Pass Through Agreement to be made,
given, furnished or filed shall be in writing, mailed
by certified mail, postage prepaid, or by confirmed
telecopy, and (i) if to the Pass Through Trustee, at
its office at 1301 Gervis Street, 4th Floor, Columbia,
South Carolina 29201 (telecopier (803) 929-5922),
Attention: Corporate Trust Administration (with a copy
to NationsBank of Georgia, National Association, at
600 Peachtree Street, N.E., Suite 900, Atlanta,
Georgia 30308 (telecopier (404) 607-6534), Attention:

change the address to which notices to such party will

Where this Pass Through Agreement or any
Series Supplement provides for notice to
Certificateholders of any Series, such notice shall be
sufficiently given (unless otherwise expressly
provided herein) if in writing and mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to each such Certificateholder
entitled thereto, at his last address as it appears in
the related Register. In any case where notice to
Certificateholders of any Series is given by mail,
neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any
defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular
Certificateholder shall affect the sufficiency of such
notice with respect to other Certificateholders of
such Series. Where this Pass Through Agreement or any
Series Supplement provides for notice in any manner,
such notice may be waived in writing by the person
entitled to receive such notice, either before or
after the event, and such waiver shall be the
equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by
Certificateholders shall be filed with the Pass
Through Trustee, but such filing shall not be a
condition precedent to the validity of any action
taken in reliance upon such waiver.

In case, by reason of the suspension of or
irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be
impracticable to mail notice to any Certificateholders
when such notice is required to be given pursuant to
any provision of this Pass Through Agreement or any
related Series Supplement, then any manner of giving
such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Pass
Through Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient
giving of such notice.

SECTION 13.07. Officers' Certificates and
Opinions of Counsel; Statements to Be Contained
Therein. Upon any application or demand by the
Company to the Pass Through Trustee to take any
action, the Company shall furnish to the Pass Through
Trustee (i) an Officers' Certificate stating that all
conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this
Pass Through Agreement and the applicable Series
Supplement relating to the proposed action have been
complied with and that the proposed action is in
conformity with the requirements of this Pass Through
Agreement and such Series Supplement, and (ii) an
Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such
counsel all such conditions precedent, if any, have
been complied with, except that in the case of any
such application or demand as to which the furnishing
of such documents is specifically required by any
provision of this Pass Through Agreement or such
Series Supplement relating to such particular
application or demand, no additional certificate or
opinion need be furnished.

Each certificate or opinion required by this
Pass Through Agreement or any Series Supplement and
delivered to the Pass Through Trustee with respect to
compliance with a condition or covenant provided for
in this Pass Through Agreement or such Series
Supplement, except for the certificate required by
Section 4.03(d) shall include (a) a statement that the
person making such certificate or opinion has read
such covenant or condition, (b) a brief statement as
to the nature and scope of the examination or
investigation upon which the statements or opinions
contained in such certificate or opinion are based,
(c) a statement that, in the opinion of such person,
he has made such examination or investigation as is
necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion
as to whether or not such covenant or condition has
been complied with and (d) a statement as to whether
or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition
or covenant has been complied with.

Any certificate, statement or opinion of
counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual
matters information with respect to which is in the
possession of the Company, upon the certificate,
statement or opinion of or representations by an
officer or officers of the Company unless such counsel
knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or
representations with respect to the matters upon which
his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as
aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know that the same are
erroneous.

Any certificate, statement or opinion of an
officer of the Company or of counsel thereto may be
based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters,
upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by
an accountant or firm of accountants employed by the
Company unless such officer or counsel, as the case
may be, knows that the certificate or opinion or
representations with respect to the accounting matters
upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may
be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the
exercise of reasonable care should know that the same
are erroneous.

Any certificate or opinion of any independent
firm of public accountants filed with the Pass Through
Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is
independent.

SECTION 13.08. Conflict of Any Provision of
Pass Through Agreement with the Trust Indenture Act.
If and to the extent that any provision of this Pass
Through Agreement limits, qualifies or conflicts with
another provision included in this Pass Through
Agreement by operation of Sections 310 to 317,
inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act (an
"incorporated provision"), such incorporated provision
shall control.

SECTION 13.09. Severability. Any provision
of this Pass Through Agreement or any Series
Supplement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof or thereof, and any such prohibition
or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

Continuing Waivers. No terms or provisions of this
Pass Through Agreement, any Series Supplement, or any
Pass Through Certificates may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an

discharge or termination is sought; and any waiver of
the terms hereof or thereof shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose
given.

SECTION 13.11. Successors and Assigns. All
covenants and agreements contained herein shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, each of the
parties hereto and the successors and permitted
assigns of each, all as herein provided. Any request,
notice, direction, consent, waiver or other instrument
or action by any Certificateholder shall bind the
successors and assigns of such Certificateholder.

SECTION 13.12. Headings. The headings of
the various Articles and Sections herein and in the
table of contents hereto are for the convenience of
reference only and shall not define or limit any of
the terms or provisions hereof.

SECTION 13.13. Normal Commercial Relations.

the contrary notwithstanding, the Pass Through Trustee
and any Certificateholder, or any bank or other
affiliate of any such party, may conduct any banking

to the same extent as if this Pass Through Agreement

Company for any purpose whatsoever, whether related to
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise.

The Pass Through Certificates do not
represent a direct obligation of, or an obligation
guaranteed by, or an interest in, the Company or the
Pass Through Trustee or any affiliate thereof. The
Pass Through Certificates are limited in right of
payment, all as more specifically set forth on the
face hereof and in the Pass Through Agreement and the
Series Supplement. All payments or distributions made
to Certificateholders under the Pass Through Agreement
shall be made only from the Trust Property and only to
the extent that the Pass Through Trustee shall have
sufficient income or proceeds from the Trust Property
to make such payments in accordance with the terms of
the Pass Through Agreement and the Series Supplement.
Each Certificateholder of this Pass Through
Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, agrees that it
will look solely to the income and proceeds from the
Trust Property to the extent available for
distribution to such Certificateholder as provided in
the Pass Through Agreement and the Series Supplement.
In connection with withholding taxes, under certain
circumstances the Pass Through Trustee may retain
certain amounts otherwise distributable to a
Certificateholder. The purchase by any
Certificateholder of any Pass Through Certificate
constitutes the consent of such Certificateholder to
such retention in accordance with the terms of the
Pass Through Agreement. This Pass Through Certificate
does not purport to summarize the Pass Through
Agreement and the Series Supplement and reference is
made to the Pass Through Agreement and the Series
Supplement for information with respect to the
interests, rights, benefits, obligations, proceeds and
duties evidenced hereby. A copy of the Pass Through
Agreement and the Series Supplement may be examined
by any Certificateholder upon request during normal
business hours at the principal office of the Pass
Through Trustee, and at such other places designated
by the Pass Through Trustee.

As of the date of issuance of this Pass
Through Certificate, and assuming that no prepayment,
purchase or default in respect of the Equipment Trust
Certificates shall occur, the aggregate scheduled
repayments of principal on the Equipment Trust
Certificates for the Pass Through Trust and the
resulting Pool Factors for the Pass Through Trust
after taking into account each such repayment are set

therein, the amendment thereof and the modification of
the rights and obligations of the Company and the
rights of the Certificateholders under the Pass
Through Trust at any time by the Company and the Pass
Through Trustee with the consent of the Majority In
Interest of Certificateholders in the Pass Through
Trust. Any such consent by the Certificateholder of
this Pass Through Certificate shall be conclusive and
binding on such Certificateholder and upon all future
Certificateholders of this Pass Through Certificate
and of any Pass Through Certificate issued upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu
hereof whether or not notation of such consent is made
upon this Pass Through Certificate. The Pass Through
Agreement and the Series Supplement also permit the
amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances,
without the consent of the Certificateholders of any
of the Pass Through Certificates.

As provided in the Pass Through Agreement and
the Series Supplement and subject to certain
limitations set forth therein, the transfer of this
Pass Through Certificate is registrable in the
Register upon surrender of this Pass Through
Certificate for registration of transfer to the Pass
Through Trustee in its capacity as Registrar, or by
any successor Registrar, duly endorsed or accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Pass Through Trustee and the
Registrar duly executed by the Certificateholder
hereof or such Certificateholder's attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Pass Through Certificates of authorized denominations
evidencing the same aggregate Fractional Undivided
Interest in the Pass Through Trust will be issued to
the designated transferee or transferees.

The Pass Through Certificates are issuable
only as registered Pass Through Certificates without
coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 Fractional
Undivided Interest and integral multiples thereof. As
provided in the Pass Through Agreement and the Series
Supplement and subject to certain limitations set
forth therein, the Pass Through Certificates are
exchangeable for new Pass Through Certificates of
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
Fractional Undivided Interest in the Pass Through
Trust, as requested by the Certificateholder
surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made for any such
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Pass
Through Trustee shall require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge
payable in connection therewith.

The Pass Through Trustee, the Registrar, and
any agent of the Pass Through Trustee or the Registrar
may treat the person in whose name this Pass Through
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, and neither the Pass Through Trustee, the
Registrar, nor any such agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

The obligations and responsibilities created
by the Pass Through Agreement and the Series
Supplement and the Pass Through Trust created thereby
shall terminate upon the distribution to
Certificateholders of all amounts required to be
distributed to them pursuant to the Pass Through
Agreement and the Series Supplement and the
disposition of all property held as part of the Trust
Property.

Each Certificateholder of this Pass Through

distribution to such Certificateholder as provided in
the Pass Through Agreement and the Series Supplement.
In connection with withholding taxes, under certain
circumstances the Pass Through Trustee may retain
certain amounts otherwise distributable to a

constitutes the consent of such Certificateholder to
such retention in accordance with the terms of the
Pass Through Agreement. This Pass Through Certificate
does not purport to summarize the Pass Through
Agreement and the Series Supplement and reference is
made to the Pass Through Agreement and the Series
Supplement for information with respect to the
interests, rights, benefits, obligations, proceeds and

any successor Registrar, duly endorsed or accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer in form

evidencing the same aggregate Fractional Undivided
Interest in the Pass Through Trust will be issued to
the designated transferee or transferees.

The Pass Through Certificates are issuable
only as registered Pass Through Certificates without

payable in connection therewith.

any agent of the Pass Through Trustee or the Registrar
may treat the person in whose name this Pass Through
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, and neither the Pass Through Trustee, the
Registrar, nor any such agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

The obligations and responsibilities created
by the Pass Through Agreement and the Series

HABENDUM CLAUSE

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the aforesaid property
unto the Indenture Trustee, its successors and
assigns, in trust for the equal and ratable benefit
and security of the Holders from time to time of the
Certificates, without any priority of any one
Certificate over any other and for the uses and
purposes and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Indenture.

It is expressly agreed that anything
contained in this Indenture to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Owner Trustee shall remain liable
under the Indenture Documents to perform all of the
obligations assumed by it under any of those
documents, all in accordance with and pursuant to the
terms and provisions of those documents, and the
Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Certificates
shall have no obligation or liability under the
Indenture Documents by reason of or arising out of the
assignment under this Indenture, nor shall the
Indenture Trustee or the Holders of the Certificates
be required or obligated in any manner to perform or
fulfill any obligations of the Owner Trustee under or
pursuant to the Indenture Documents or, except as
expressly provided in this Indenture, to make any
payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or
sufficiency of any payment received by it, or present
or file any claim, or take any action to collect or
enforce the payment of any amounts which may have been
assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any
time or times.

The Owner Trustee hereby constitutes the
Indenture Trustee the true and lawful attorney of the
Owner Trustee, irrevocably, with full power (in the
name of the Owner Trustee or otherwise), subject to
the terms and conditions of this Indenture, to ask,
require, demand, receive, compound and give
acquittance for any and all Basic Rent, Supplemental
Rent payable to the Owner Trustee, Stipulated Loss
Value and Termination Value payments, insurance
proceeds and any and all moneys and claims for moneys
due and to become due under or arising out of the
Lease (subject to Section 8.01 hereof) or the other
Indenture Documents (other than Excepted Payments), to
endorse any checks or other instruments or orders in
connection with the same and to file any claims, take
any action or institute any proceeding which the
Indenture Trustee may deem to be necessary or
advisable in the premises.

Under the Lease the Lessee will be directed
to make all payments of Rent on or after the Exchange
Date (other than Excepted Payments) payable to the
Owner Trustee and all other amounts (other than
Excepted Payments) which are required to be paid to or
deposited with the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Lease
directly to the Indenture Trustee at such address in
the United States of America as the Indenture Trustee
shall specify for application as provided in this
Indenture. The Owner Trustee agrees that if,
notwithstanding such provision, it shall have received
any such amounts, promptly on receipt of any such
payment, it will transfer to the Indenture Trustee any
and all moneys from time to time received by the Owner
Trustee constituting part of the Trust Indenture
Estate for distribution by the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to this Indenture, except that the Owner
Trustee shall accept for distribution pursuant to the
Trust Agreement (i) any amounts distributed to it by
the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture, and (ii)
any Excepted Payments.

The Owner Trustee agrees that at any time and
from time to time, upon the written request of the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee will promptly and
duly execute and deliver or cause to be duly executed
and delivered any and all such further instruments and
documents as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably deem
desirable in obtaining the full benefits of the
assignment hereunder and of the rights and powers
herein granted; provided, however, that the Owner
Trustee shall have no obligation to execute and
deliver or cause to be executed or delivered to the
Indenture Trustee any such instrument or document if
such execution and delivery would result in the
imposition of additional liabilities on the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant or would result in a
burden on the Owner Participant's business activities,
unless the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, as
the case may be, is indemnified to its reasonable
satisfaction against any losses, liabilities and
expenses incurred in connection with such execution
and delivery pursuant to any Operative Agreement.

The Owner Trustee does hereby warrant and
represent that it has not assigned or pledged, and
hereby covenants that it will not assign or pledge, so
long as the assignment hereunder shall remain in
effect, any of its right, title or interest hereby
assigned, to anyone other than the Indenture Trustee,
and that it will not, except as provided in or
permitted by this Indenture, accept any payment from
the Lessee, enter into an agreement amending or
supplementing any of the Operative Agreements, execute
any waiver or modification of, or consent under the
terms of any of the Operative Agreements, settle or
compromise any claim (other than claims in respect of
Excepted Payments) against the Lessee arising under
any of the Operative Agreements, or submit or consent
to the submission of any dispute, difference or other
matter arising under or in respect of any of the
Operative Agreements, to arbitration thereunder.

Concurrently with the delivery of this
Indenture the Owner Trustee has delivered to the
Indenture Trustee executed counterparts of the Trust
Agreement, the Agreement to Lease and the sole
original counterparts of the Demand Notes, and executed
counterparts or certified copies of the Sales
Agreement, the Modification Agreement and the Parts
and Services Agreement. On the Commencement Date, the
Owner Trustee will deliver to the Indenture Trustee
executed copies of the Trust Agreement Supplement. On
the Exchange Date, the Owner Trustee will deliver to
the Indenture Trustee in New York the chattel paper
original counterparts of the Lease and the Lease
Supplement.

It is hereby further covenanted and agreed by
and between the parties as follows: (i) subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent to
commencement of the Lease and to the Indenture
Trustee's obligations set forth in Section 4 of the
Agreement to Lease and Sections 4.02 and 4.03, as the
case may be, of the Participation Agreement (such
satisfaction or waiver to be confirmed by a
certificate of the Owner Participant), on the Exchange
Date the Indenture Trustee shall release from the
Collateral Account any Demand Note Collateral then
held by the Indenture Trustee, and (ii) the Indenture
Trustee shall not demand any payment under the Demand
Notes except as under circumstances set forth in the
Collateral Agreement or as contemplated by Section
7.02 or 7.03 hereof.

Article I

DEFINITIONS

SECTION 1.01. Definitions. Unless the
context otherwise requires, capitalized terms utilized
herein shall have the meanings set forth in Schedule
II hereto for all purposes of this Indenture and shall
be equally applicable to both the singular and plural
forms of the terms defined.

Article II

ISSUE, EXECUTION, FORM AND
REGISTRATION OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01. Authentication and Delivery of
Certificates. Forthwith upon the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, and from time to time
thereafter, Certificates in an aggregate principal
amount not in excess of the amount specified in
Section 2.04 hereof (except as otherwise provided in
Sections 2.06 and 2.07 hereof) shall be executed by
the Owner Trustee and delivered to the Indenture
Trustee for authentication, and the Indenture Trustee
shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said
Certificates to or upon the oral or written order of
the Owner Trustee, signed, if written, by an
authorized officer of the Owner Trustee, without any
further action by the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 2.02. Execution of Certificates.
The Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the
Owner Trustee by an authorized officer of First
Security. Such signatures may be the manual or
facsimile signatures of such officer and minor errors
or defects in any reproduction of any such signature
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
Certificate which has been duly authenticated and
delivered by the Indenture Trustee.

In case any officer of First Security who
shall have signed any of the Certificates shall cease
to be such officer before the Certificate so signed
shall be authenticated and delivered by the Indenture
Trustee or disposed of by First Security, such
Certificate nevertheless may be authenticated and
delivered or disposed of as though the person who
signed such Certificate had not ceased to be such
officer of the Owner Trustee; and any Certificate may
be signed on behalf of the Owner Trustee by such
person or persons as, at the actual date of the
execution of such Certificate, shall be the proper
officers of First Security, although at the date of
the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such
person was not such an officer. Certificates bearing
the facsimile signatures of individuals who were
authorized officers of First Security at the time such
Certificates were issued shall bind the Owner Trustee,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them
have ceased to hold such offices prior to the
authentication and delivery of such Certificates or
did not hold such offices at the respective dates of
such Certificates.

SECTION 2.03. Certificate of Authentication.
Only such Certificates as shall bear thereon a
certificate of authentication substantially in the
form set forth in Exhibit B, executed by the Indenture
Trustee by manual signature of one of its authorized
officers, shall be entitled to the security and
benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory
for any purpose. Such certificate by the Indenture
Trustee upon any Certificate executed by the Owner
Trustee shall be conclusive evidence that the Certifi-
cate so authenticated has been duly authenticated and
delivered hereunder and that the Holder, as evidenced
on the Register, is entitled to the security and
benefits of this Indenture.

SECTION 2.04. Form and Terms of
Certificates; Payments of Principal, Make-Whole
Premium and Interest. The Certificates and the
Indenture Trustee's certificate of authentication
shall be substantially in the form set forth in
Exhibit B hereto. Certificates may differ with
respect to Maturity and as to other terms. The
Certificates shall be issuable as registered
securities without coupons and shall be numbered,
lettered, or otherwise distinguished in such manner or
in accordance with such plans as the Owner Trustee
executing the same may determine with the approval of
the Indenture Trustee.

The aggregate principal amount of
Certificates that may be authenticated and delivered
under this Indenture is limited as provided in the
form of Certificate attached as Exhibit B hereto. The
Certificates shall be issued in registered form only
and in denominations of $1,000 and any integral
multiple thereof, shall be dated the Closing Date, and
shall be issued in the Maturities and principal
amounts, and shall bear interest at the rates per
annum, specified in the form of Certificate set forth
in Exhibit B.

Any of the Certificates may be issued with
appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
variations, and may have imprinted or otherwise
reproduced thereon such legend or legends, not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, as
may be required to comply with any law or with any
rules or regulations pursuant thereto, or with the
rules of any securities market in which the
Certificates are admitted to trading, or to conform to
general usage.

Each Certificate shall bear interest from the
date of original issuance thereof or from the most
recent date to which interest has been paid and duly
provided for, as the case may be, which shall be
payable on the dates specified on the face of the form
of Certificate set forth in Exhibit B hereto until the
principal thereof is paid. Interest shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, each
Certificate shall bear interest at the Past Due Rate
on any principal, interest and any other amount
payable hereunder or under such Certificate, which
shall not be paid in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or
otherwise), for the period from and including the due
date thereof to but excluding the date the same is
paid in full, payable from time to time on demand of
the Indenture Trustee.

The principal of, and Make-Whole Premium, if
any, and interest on, the Certificates shall be
payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture
Trustee or at any office or agency maintained for such
purpose pursuant to Section 3.02 hereof; provided,
however, that interest may be payable at the option of
the Indenture Trustee or its Paying Agent, as defined
in Section 3.04, by mailing checks for such interest
payable to or upon the written order of the Holders
entitled thereto as they shall appear on the Register;
provided further, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, interest payable with
respect to the Certificates as to which the Pass
Through Trustee is the Holder shall be sent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts in the United States previously specified
by the Pass Through Trustee to the Indenture Trustee.

The Holder at the close of business on any
Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date
shall be entitled to receive the interest if any
payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding
any transfer or exchange of such Certificate
subsequent to the Record Date and prior to such
Interest Payment Date, except if and to the extent the
Owner Trustee shall default in the payment of the
interest due on such Interest Payment Date, in which
case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the
Holder at the close of business on a subsequent Record
Date (which shall be not less than five (5) or more
than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date of
payment of such defaulted interest) established by
notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Owner
Trustee to the Holders not less than fifteen (15) days
preceding such subsequent Record Date.

SECTION 2.05. Payments from Trust Indenture
Estate Only. All payments to be made by the Owner
Trustee under this Indenture shall be made only from
the income and the proceeds from the Lessor's Estate
to the extent included in the Trust Indenture Estate
and from any other amounts (i) of the type described
in Section 5.01 hereof to the extent actually received
by the Indenture Trustee and (ii) from the Letter of
Credit, and only to the extent that the Owner Trustee
shall have sufficient income or proceeds from the
Lessor's Estate to the extent included in the Trust
Indenture Estate (and such other amounts) to enable
the Indenture Trustee to make distributions of the
amounts due in respect of the Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof. Each
Holder by its acceptance of a Certificate agrees that
it will look solely to the income and proceeds from
the Trust Indenture Estate (and such other amounts of
the type contemplated by clause (i) and (ii) above) to
the extent actually received by the Indenture Trustee
and available for distribution to it as provided
herein and that neither the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee, First Security nor the Indenture
Trustee is personally liable to such Holder for any
amounts payable under this Indenture or such
Certificate or for any amounts payable or liability
under any Certificate or this Indenture, except as
expressly provided herein in the case of First
Security, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee,
or in the case of the Owner Participant, except as
expressly provided in the Participation Agreement.

First Security is not personally liable to
any Holder, the Lessee, the Owner Participant or the
Indenture Trustee for any amounts payable under this
Indenture or for any liability under this Indenture or
the Certificates, except as a result of First
Security's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or
as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the
Participation Agreement.

If (1) all or any part of the Lessor's Estate
becomes the property of a debtor subject to the
reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Code,
(2) pursuant to such reorganization provisions,
including Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Owner Participant is required, by reason of First
Security or the Owner Participant being held to have
recourse liability to the Indenture Trustee or any
Holder, directly or indirectly, to make payment on
account of any amount payable as principal of or
interest, Make-Whole Premium or other amounts payable
on the Certificates and (3) the Indenture Trustee
actually receives any Recourse Amount which reflects
any payment by the Owner Participant on account of (2)
above, then, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, and subject to the receipt by the Indenture
Trustee prior to its disbursement of such Recourse
Amount of written notice from the Owner Participant or
the Owner Trustee reasonably relating to the refund
obligation in this sentence, the Indenture Trustee
shall promptly refund to the Owner Participant such
Recourse Amount. The Indenture Trustee hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by law the benefit of
the provisions of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to recourse against First Security
and the Owner Participant on account of any amount
payable as principal of or interest, Make-Whole
Premium or other amounts payable on the Certificates.
Nothing contained in this paragraph shall prevent the
Indenture Trustee from enforcing any personal recourse
obligation (and retaining the proceeds thereof) of the
Owner Participant under the Participation Agreement, this
Indenture (other than referred to in clause (2) above),
the Trust Agreement (and any exhibits or annexes thereto)
or any other Operative Agreement, or from retaining any
amount paid by the Owner Participant under Sections 5.01,
8.02 and 8.03 hereof. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as requiring any Holder to refund any amount
distributed to such Holder pursuant to this Indenture.

SECTION 2.06. Registration, Transfer and
Exchange. The Indenture Trustee will keep, on behalf
of the Owner Trustee, at each office or agency to be
maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.02
hereof a Register or Registers on which, subject to
such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it
will register, and will register the transfer of,
Certificates as provided in this Article. Such
Register shall be in written form in the English
language or in any other form capable of being
converted into such form within a reasonable time.

Upon due presentation for registration of
transfer of any Certificate at any such office or
agency, the Owner Trustee shall execute and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in
the name of the transferee or transferees a new
Certificate or Certificates of the same Maturity and
interest rate and in authorized denominations for an
equal aggregate principal amount.

Any Certificate or Certificates may be
exchanged for a Certificate or Certificates of the
same Maturity and interest rate but in other
authorized denominations, in an equal aggregate
principal amount. Certificates to be exchanged shall
be surrendered at any office or agency to be
maintained by the Indenture Trustee for the purpose as
provided in Section 3.02 hereof, and the Owner Trustee
shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the
Certificate or Certificates which the Holder making
the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing
numbers not contemporaneously or previously
outstanding.

All Certificates presented for registration
of transfer, exchange, prepayment or payment shall (if
so required by the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee duly executed by the Holder or its attorney
duly authorized in writing and (except in the case of
transfers pursuant to Section 15 of the Participation
Agreement) the Indenture Trustee may require evidence
satisfactory to it as to the compliance of any such
transfer with the Securities Act.

The Indenture Trustee may require payment
from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any exchange or registration of
transfer of Certificates. No service charge shall be
levied for any such transaction.

The Indenture Trustee shall not be required
to exchange or register a transfer of any Certificates
(a) for a period of fifteen (15) days immediately
preceding the first mailing of notice of prepayment of
such Certificates or (b) with respect to which notice
of prepayment has been given pursuant to Section 6.03
hereof and such notice has not been revoked.

All Certificates issued upon any transfer or
exchange of Certificates shall be valid obligations of
the Owner Trustee, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefits under this
Indenture, as the Certificates surrendered upon such
transfer or exchange.

SECTION 2.07. Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed,
Lost and Stolen Certificates. In case any temporary
or definitive Certificate shall become mutilated,
defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen,
the Owner Trustee in its discretion may execute, and
upon the oral or written request of any officer of
First Security, the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, a new Certificate of like
Maturity, bearing a number not contemporaneously or
previously outstanding, in exchange and substitution
for the mutilated or defaced Certificate, or in lieu
of and substitution for the Certificate so apparently
destroyed, lost or stolen. In case of any Certificate
so apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the applicant
for a substitute Certificate shall furnish to the
Owner Trustee and to the Indenture Trustee such
security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by
them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them
harmless from issuance of such substitute Certificate
(in the case of the Pass Through Trustee, a personal
agreement to indemnify shall be sufficient for this
purpose) and, in any case of destruction, loss or
theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent
destruction, loss or theft of such Certificate and of
the ownership thereof.

Upon the issuance of any substitute
Certificate, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee may require payment from the Holder of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other reasonable expenses connected therewith. In
case any Certificate which has matured or is about to
mature, or has been called for prepayment in full,
shall become mutilated or defaced or be apparently
destroyed, lost or stolen, the Owner Trustee may,
instead of issuing a substitute Certificate, pay or
authorize the payment of the same (without surrender
thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced
Certificate), if the applicant of any Certificate so
apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, for such payment
shall furnish to the Owner Trustee and to the
Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as any of
them may require to save each of them harmless and the
applicant shall also furnish to the Owner Trustee and
the Indenture Trustee evidence to their satisfaction
of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such
Certificate and of the ownership thereof.

Every substitute Certificate issued pursuant
to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the
fact that any Certificate is apparently destroyed,
lost or stolen shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Owner Trustee, whether
or not the apparently destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificate shall be enforceable at any time by anyone
and shall be entitled to all the security and benefits
of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of
rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Certificates
duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be held and owned upon the express
condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the
foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, or
apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates and
shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies
notwithstanding any law or statute existing or
hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the
replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or
other securities without their surrender.

SECTION 2.08. Cancellation of Certificates;
Destruction Thereof. All Certificates surrendered for
payment, prepayment, registration of transfer or
exchange, if surrendered to the Owner Trustee or any
agent of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee,
shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee for
cancellation or, if surrendered to the Indenture
Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Certificates
shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly
permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture.
The Indenture Trustee shall deliver the cancelled
Certificates to the Owner Trustee for destruction. If
the Owner Trustee shall acquire any of the
Certificates, such acquisition shall not operate as a
prepayment or satisfaction of the indebtedness
represented by such Certificates unless and until the
same are delivered to the Indenture Trustee for
cancellation.

SECTION 2.09. Temporary Certificates.
Pending the preparation of definitive Certificates,
the Owner Trustee may execute and, upon the oral or
written request of an officer of the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver
temporary Certificates (printed, lithographed,
typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in
form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee).
Temporary Certificates shall be issuable as registered
Certificates without coupons, of any authorized
denomination, and substantially in the form of the
definitive Certificates but with such omissions,
insertions and variations as may be appropriate for
temporary Certificates, all as may be determined by
the Owner Trustee with the concurrence of the
Indenture Trustee. Temporary Certificates may contain
such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as
may be appropriate. Every temporary Certificate shall
be executed by the Owner Trustee and, upon the oral or
written request of an authorized officer of the Owner
Trustee, be authenticated by the Indenture Trustee
upon the same conditions and in substantially the same
manner, and with like effect, as the definitive
Certificates. Without unreasonable delay the Owner
Trustee shall execute and shall furnish definitive
Certificates and thereupon temporary Certificates
shall be surrendered in exchange therefor without
charge at any office or agency to be maintained by the
Indenture Trustee for the purpose pursuant to Section
3.02 hereof, and, upon the oral or written request of
an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in
exchange for such temporary Certificates an equal
aggregate principal amount of definitive Certificates
of the same Maturities and interest rates and in
authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, tempo-
rary Certificates shall be entitled to the same
security and benefits under this Indenture as
definitive Certificates.

SECTION 2.10. Termination of Interest in
Trust Indenture Estate. A Holder shall not, as such,
have any further interest in, or other right with
respect to, the Trust Indenture Estate when and if the
principal amount of and Make-Whole Premium, if any,
and interest on and other amounts due under all
Certificates held by such Holder and all other sums
payable to such Holder hereunder and under such
Certificates shall have been paid in full.

SECTION 2.11. Certificates in Respect of
Replacement Engines. Upon the execution and delivery
of an Indenture and Security Agreement Supplement
covering a Replacement Engine, as provided in Section
9.09 hereof, each Certificate shall be deemed to have
been issued in connection with such Replacement Engine

tions 5.02(b), 5.04(b), 5.04(c) and 5.05(b) hereof,
all payments received and all amounts held or realized
by the Indenture Trustee (a) after an Indenture Event

by each such Holder, the accrued but unpaid
interest thereon to the date of distribution and
all other amounts due hereunder and thereunder
(but without Make-Whole Premium, except to the
extent otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.02

prior to the payment in full of all obligations to the
Holders secured by the Lien of this Indenture, in the
order of priority specified in Section 5.01 hereof,
and (b) to the extent received or realized at any time
after payment in full of all obligations to the

Any amounts distributed hereunder by the Indenture
Trustee to the Owner Trustee shall be paid, subject to

and the time periods specified therein), to the Owner
Trustee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds of the type received by the Indenture Trustee at
such office and to such account or accounts of such

Whole Premium, if any, and, to the extent permitted by
law, interest and other amounts due thereunder,
second, to the payment of any other amount (other than
the principal of such Certificate) due hereunder to
the Holder of such Certificate or under such
Certificate, third, to the payment of the principal of
such Certificate if then due hereunder or under such
Certificate and fourth, the balance, if any remaining

SECTION 5.08. Investment of Amounts Held by
Indenture Trustee. Amounts held by the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to Section 5.02(b) hereof or pursuant
to any provision of any Indenture Document providing
for investment of sums pursuant to Section 23.01 of
the Lease or this Section 5.08 shall be invested by
the Indenture Trustee from time to time in securities
selected by (i) so long as no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee or (ii) so
long as an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Indenture Trustee and in each case
shall be of the type listed in clauses (i) through
(iv) of Section 23.01 of the Lease. Unless otherwise
expressly provided in this Indenture, any income
realized as a result of any such investment, net of
the Indenture Trustee's reasonable fees and expenses
in making such investment, shall be held and applied
by the Indenture Trustee in the same manner as the
principal amount of such investment is to be applied
and any losses, net of earnings and such reasonable
fees and expenses, shall be charged against the
principal amount invested. The Lessee shall be
responsible for and will promptly pay to the Indenture
Trustee or the Lessor, as the case may be, on demand,
the amount of any loss realized as the result of any
such investment (together with any fees, commissions
and other costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the
Indenture Trustee or the Lessor in connection with
such investment), such amount to be disposed of in
accordance with the terms hereof or the Lease, as the
case may be. The Indenture Trustee shall not be
liable for any loss resulting from any investment made
by it under this Indenture in accordance with
instructions from the Lessee other than by reason of
its willful misconduct or gross negligence, and any
such investment may be sold (without regard to its
maturity) by the Indenture Trustee without
instructions whenever the Indenture Trustee reasonably
believes such sale is necessary to make a distribution
required by this Indenture.

Unless otherwise confirmed in writing, an
account statement delivered by the Indenture Trustee
to the Owner Trustee (with a copy to the Lessee) shall
be deemed written confirmation by the Owner Trustee
that the investment transactions identified therein
accurately reflect the investment directions given to
the Indenture Trustee by or on behalf of the Owner
Trustee, unless the Owner Trustee (or the Lessee on
its behalf) notifies the Indenture Trustee in writing
to the contrary within 30 days of the date of receipt
of such statement.

SECTION 5.09. Withholding Taxes. The
Indenture Trustee shall withhold any Taxes required to
be withheld, except to the extent that the Holder has
furnished evidence satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee of any exemption from withholding claimed by
such Holder, and under no circumstances shall the
failure of any such Holder to receive any amounts so
withheld constitute an Indenture Event of Default.

in Section 6.06 hereof), the Owner Trustee shall, to
the extent that, after the Pre-Funding Period, an
amount equal to the Prepayment Price or the Sinking
Fund Redemption Price (as defined in Section 6.06
hereof) as the case may be, shall not then be held in
the Trust Indenture Estate, deposit with the Indenture
Trustee in immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the difference between (a) the amount then
held in the Trust Indenture Estate and (b) the
Prepayment Price or the Sinking Fund Redemption Price,
as the case may be. If there shall so be on deposit
and/or deposited the applicable Prepayment Price or
Sinking Fund Redemption Price on or prior to a
Prepayment Date or Sinking Fund Redemption Date,
interest shall cease to accrue in respect of all or,
in the case of a mandatory sinking fund redemption,
the relevant portion being prepaid of, the outstanding
Certificates on and after such Prepayment Date or such
Sinking Fund Redemption Date.

SECTION 6.05. Certificates Payable on
Prepayment Date. On the Prepayment Date, the
outstanding Certificates shall (except if the Owner
Trustee has requested the Indenture Trustee to revoke
such notice of prepayment in accordance with Section
6.03 hereof) become due and payable and from and after
such Prepayment Date (unless there shall be a default
in the payment of the Prepayment Price) such
Certificates shall cease to bear interest. Upon
surrender by any Holder of its Certificate for
prepayment in accordance with said notice, such Holder
shall be paid the principal amount of its Certificate
then outstanding, accrued interest thereon to the
Prepayment Date, all other sums due to such Holder
hereunder, under the Participation Agreement or the
Lease, plus, if a Make-Whole Premium is payable
pursuant to Section 6.02(b) hereof, the Make-Whole
Premium in respect of such Certificate.

If any Certificate called for prepayment
shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for
prepayment, the principal shall, until paid, continue
to bear interest from the Prepayment Date at the
interest rate applicable to such Certificate.

SECTION 6.06. Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption. The Certificates with a Maturity of
September 23, 2006, the Certificates with a Maturity of
September 23, 2008, and the Certificates with a Maturity of
March 23, 2010 shall be subject to partial redemption,
on a pro rata basis on each date specified in this
Section (a "Sinking Fund Redemption Date"). The Owner
Trustee shall deposit funds sufficient to pay the
Sinking Fund Redemption Price with the Indenture
Trustee as provided in Section 6.04 hereof. The
Indenture Trustee shall pay from the amounts so
deposited on each applicable Sinking Fund Redemption
Date to the Holders of each Certificate then
outstanding on a pro rata basis the aggregate
principal amount set forth below, together with
accrued interest to such Sinking Fund Redemption Date,
but without Make-Whole Premium (the "Sinking Fund
Redemption Price"):

or a trustee, custodian, receiver or
liquidator which is either final and non-
appealable, or (b) an opinion of counsel
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee shall
be provided by the Owner Participant, in each
case to the effect that no part of the
Lessor's Estate (except for the Owner
Participant's beneficial interest in the
Lessor's Estate) and no right, title or

guaranteeing the obligations of the Owner
Participant, and such order shall not be
dismissed within 90 days; provided that an
event referred to in this Section 7.01(vii)

if (a) an order, judgment or decree shall be

trustee, custodian, receiver or liquidator
which is either final and non-appealable, or
(b) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the

(viii) at any time on or after the Exchange
Date while the Aircraft is registered in the

the Owner Participant or any Person guaranteeing
the obligations of the Owner Participant shall do
or fail to do any act expressly required by the
Operative Agreements to be performed by the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant, as the case may
be, or shall meet or fail to meet any condition
expressly required by the Operative Agreements to
be satisfied by the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant, or as the case may be, and as a
result thereof the Lien of this Indenture shall
cease to be a valid first priority perfected Lien
on the Indenture Estate.

SECTION 7.02. Remedies. (a) If an
Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and so long as the same shall be continuing
unremedied, then and in every such case, the Indenture
Trustee may, and when required by the provisions of
Article IX or Section 7.02(c) hereof, shall (i)
exercise any or all of the rights and powers and
pursue any and all of the remedies pursuant to this
Article VII and (ii) in the event such Indenture Event
of Default is an Indenture Event of Default referred
to in paragraph (a) of Section 7.01 hereof, exercise
any and all of the remedies pursuant to Article 17 of
the Lease. The Indenture Trustee may take possession
of all or any part of the properties covered or
intended to be covered by the Lien and security
interest created hereby or pursuant hereto and may
exclude the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the
Lessee and any transferee of the Lessee and all
persons claiming under any of them wholly or partly
therefrom. In addition, the Indenture Trustee may
exercise any other right or remedy in lieu of or in
addition to the foregoing that may be available to it
under applicable law, or proceed by appropriate court
action to enforce the terms hereof, of the Lease, or
both, or to terminate or rescind the Lease. Without
limiting any of the foregoing, it is understood and
agreed that the Indenture Trustee may exercise any
right of sale of the Aircraft available to it, even
though it shall not have taken possession of the
Aircraft and shall not have possession thereof at the
time of such sale.

While an Indenture Event of Default is in
existence that is also an Event of Default and no
other Indenture Event of Default exists, the Indenture
Trustee may only exercise remedies hereunder if the
Indenture Trustee simultaneously commences the
exercise of one or more remedies under clauses (i)
through (vi) of Section 17.01(a) of the Lease (such as
commencement of suit for overdue Basic Rent);
provided, however, that such requirement to exercise
one or more of such remedies under the Lease shall not
apply in circumstances where the Indenture Trustee is,
and has been, for a continuous period in excess of 60
days or such other period as may be specified in
Section 1110(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code (such 60-day
or other period being the "Section 1110 Period"),
involuntarily stayed or prohibited by applicable law
or court order from exercising such remedies under the
Lease (a "Continuous Stay Period"); provided, further,
however, that the requirement to exercise one or more
of such remedies under the Lease shall nonetheless be
applicable during a Continuous Stay Period subsequent
to the expiration of the Section 1110 Period to the
extent that the continuation of such Continuous Stay
Period subsequent to the expiration of the Section
1110 Period (A) results from an agreement by the
Lessee during the Section 1110 Period with the
approval of the relevant court to perform the Lease in
accordance with Section 1110(a) of the Bankruptcy Code
or (B) is an extension of the Section 1110 Period with
the consent of the Indenture Trustee pursuant to
Section 1110(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or (C) results
from the Lessee's assumption during the Section 1110
Period with the approval of the relevant bankruptcy
court of the Lease pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code or (D) is the consequence of the
Indenture Trustee's own failure to give any requisite
notice to any Person or (E) is pursuant to a judicial
stay pending the resolution of litigation with respect
to the applicability of Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code and there is either no Event of Default other
than one arising solely from the Lessee's bankruptcy
or any such other Event of Default has been cured;
provided, further, however, that the requirement to
exercise one or more of such remedies under the Lease
during a Continuous Stay Period subsequent to the
expiration of the Section 1110 Period based upon a
judicial stay as provided in this clause (E) shall in
any event cease to be applicable subsequent to the
120th day of such Continuous Stay Period; it being
understood and agreed that the Indenture Trustee may
take such action and commence such processes as it may
determine are necessary or advisable to foreclose on
the Lien of this Indenture but all such actions and
processes shall, during such period, not be completed
to effect a foreclosure. If the limitation upon cures
of the Lessee's failure to pay Basic Rent as provided
in Section 8.03(a) hereof would otherwise prohibit the
Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee from making a
payment to cure an Event of Default for purposes of
clause (E) above, the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee shall nonetheless be entitled to make such
payment. If the Indenture Trustee shall acquire title
to the Aircraft through foreclosure during a
Continuous Stay Period without having exercised one or
more of such remedies under the Lease by virtue of the
Continuous Stay Period having continued beyond its
120th day as provided above in clause (E) and the
Indenture Trustee shall have received prior to the
183rd day subsequent to its acquisition of the title
to the Aircraft, the proceeds from its sale of the
Aircraft, the Indenture Trustee shall, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Indenture, distribute to
the Owner Trustee the amount, if any, by which such
proceeds (net of the Indenture Trustee's costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and other experts and agents retained by it),
commissions and other costs and expenses with respect
to such foreclosure, the maintenance and preservation
of the Aircraft and such sale (including amounts in
respect of any thereof paid by others to whom the
Indenture Trustee has a reimbursement obligation) and
any other amounts to which the Indenture Trustee is
entitled pursuant to Section 9.11 hereof or otherwise)
exceed an amount equal to the aggregate of the
principal amount of the Certificates outstanding on
the date of such foreclosure, together with interest
accrued thereon to such foreclosure date and an amount
equal to the amount of interest that would have
accrued (at the rate per annum applicable under the
Certificates) on such principal amount from the date
of such foreclosure to the date of the distribution by
the Indenture Trustee of such proceeds for the benefit
of the Holders if such principal amount had remained
outstanding. References in this subsection (iii) to
particular sections of the Bankruptcy Code as in
effect on the date of the amendment and restatement of
this Indenture shall include any substantially similar
successor provisions.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.02(c) hereof,
if an Indenture Event of Default referred to in clause
(v), (vi) or (vii) of Section 7.01 hereof shall have
occurred, or an Event of Default referred to in clause
(e), (f) or (g) of Section 16.01 of the Lease shall
have occurred, then and in every such case the unpaid
principal of all outstanding Certificates, together
with interest accrued but unpaid thereon and all other
amounts due thereunder and hereunder, but without
Make-Whole Premium, shall immediately and without
further act become due and payable, without present-
ment, demand, protest or notice, all of which are
hereby waived.

(c) If any Indenture Event of Default not
described in the preceding paragraph (b) shall have
occurred and be continuing, then and in every such
case, the Indenture Trustee may on its own accord or
at the direction of Holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of Outstanding
Certificates, at any time, by written notice or
notices to the Owner Trustee and, if after the
Commencement Date, the Lessee, declare the principal
of all the Certificates to be due and payable,
whereupon the unpaid principal of all outstanding
Certificates, together with accrued but unpaid
interest thereon and all other amounts due thereunder,
but without Make-Whole Premium (except to the extent a
Make-Whole Premium was theretofore payable by virtue
of Section 6.02(b) hereof), shall immediately become
due and payable without presentment, demand, protest
or other notice, all of which are hereby waived. At
any time after such declaration and prior to the sale
or disposition of the Trust Indenture Estate, however,
the Holders of a Majority in Interest of Certificate
Holders, by notice to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee and, if after the Commencement Date, the
Lessee, may rescind such declaration, whether made by
the Indenture Trustee on its own accord or as
directed, if (x) there has been paid or deposited with
the Indenture Trustee (other than pursuant to the
Collateral Agreement) a sum sufficient to pay all
overdue installments of interest on all Certificates
(together, to the extent permitted by law, with
interest on such overdue installments of interest),
the principal on any Certificates that has become due
otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration,
all sums paid or advanced by the Indenture Trustee
hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee,
its agents and counsel, or (y) all Indenture Events of
Default (other than the nonpayment of principal that
has become due solely because of such acceleration)
have been either cured or waived as provided in
Section 7.11 hereof. No such rescission shall affect
any subsequent default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

(d) Each Holder shall be entitled at any
sale to a credit against any purchase price bid at
such sale by such Holder all or any part of the unpaid
obligations owing to such Holder secured by the Lien
of this Indenture.

SECTION 7.03. Return of Trust Indenture
Estate, etc. Subject to Section 7.02 hereof: (a) If
an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, at the request of the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee shall promptly execute and
deliver to the Indenture Trustee such instruments of
title and other documents as the Indenture Trustee may
deem necessary or advisable to enable the Indenture
Trustee or an agent or representative designated by
the Indenture Trustee, at such time or times and place
or places as the Indenture Trustee may specify, to
obtain possession of all or any part of the Trust
Indenture Estate to which the Indenture Trustee shall
at the time be entitled hereunder. If the Owner
Trustee shall for any reason fail to execute and
deliver such instruments and documents after such
request by the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee may (i) obtain a judgment conferring on the
Indenture Trustee the right to immediate possession
and requiring the Owner Trustee to execute and deliver
such instruments and documents to the Indenture
Trustee, to the entry of which judgment the Owner
Trustee hereby specifically consents, and (ii) pursue
all or part of the Trust Indenture Estate wherever
such Trust Indenture Estate may be found and may, in
the name of the Owner Trustee or otherwise, enter any
of the premises of the Lessee and search for and take
possession of and remove the Trust Indenture Estate.
All expenses of obtaining such judgment or of
pursuing, searching for and taking such property
shall, until paid, be secured by the Lien of this
Indenture.

(b) Upon every such taking of possession or
title, the Indenture Trustee may, from time to time,
at the expense of the Trust Indenture Estate, make all
such expenditures for maintenance, insurance, repairs,
replacements, alterations, additions and improvements
to and of the Trust Indenture Estate, as it may deem
proper. In each such case, the Indenture Trustee
shall have the right to maintain, use, operate, store,
lease, control or manage the Trust Indenture Estate
and to carry on the business and, without limiting the
express provisions of Section 8.01 hereof, to exercise
all rights and powers of the Owner Participant and the
Owner Trustee relating to the Trust Indenture Estate,
as the Indenture Trustee shall deem necessary or
appropriate, including the right to enter into any and
all such agreements with respect to the maintenance,
insurance, use, operation, storage, leasing, control,
management or disposition of the Trust Indenture
Estate or any part thereof as the Indenture Trustee
may determine; and, except for Excepted Payments
(other than Excepted Payments payable to the Indenture
Trustee), the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to
collect and receive directly all rents (including
Rent), revenues, issues, income, products and profits
of the Trust Indenture Estate and every part thereof
without prejudice to the right of the Indenture
Trustee under any provision hereof to collect and
receive all cash held by, or required to be deposited
with, the Indenture Trustee hereunder. Such rents
(including Rent), revenues, issues, income, products
and profits shall be applied to pay the expenses of
the use, operation, storage, leasing, control,
management or disposition of the Trust Indenture
Estate and of conducting the business thereof, and of
all maintenance, repairs, replacements, alterations,
additions and improvements, and to make all payments
which the Indenture Trustee may be required or may
elect to make, if any, for taxes, assessments,
insurance or other proper charges upon the Trust
Indenture Estate or any part thereof (including the
employment of engineers and accountants to examine,
inspect and make reports upon the properties and books
and records of the Owner Trustee), and all other
payments which the Indenture Trustee may be required
or authorized to make under any provision of this
Indenture, as well as just and reasonable compensation
for the services of the Indenture Trustee, and of all
persons properly engaged and employed by the Indenture
Trustee.

(c) If an Indenture Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing and the Indenture
Trustee shall be entitled to exercise remedies
hereunder, and (other than with respect to Collateral)
subject to Article VIII hereof, the Indenture Trustee,
either with or without taking possession, and either
before or after taking possession, and without
instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, may
sell, assign, transfer and deliver the whole or, from
time to time, to the extent permitted by law, any part
of the Trust Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or
interest therein, at any private sale or public
auction, with or without demand, advertisement or
notice, except as expressly provided for below in this
Section 7.03(c), for cash or credit or for other
property, for immediate or future delivery, and for
such price or prices and on such terms as the
Indenture Trustee in its sole discretion may
determine; provided, that any such action shall be at
the time lawful and that all mandatory legal
requirements shall be complied with. Other than with
respect to Collateral, the Indenture Trustee shall, to
the extent permitted by law, give the Owner Trustee,
the Owner Participant and, if after the Exchange Date,
the Lessee at least 30 days' notice of any public or
private sale. Such notice, in the case of a public
sale, shall state the time and place fixed for such
sale. Any such public sale shall be held at such time
or times within ordinary business hours as the
Indenture Trustee shall fix in the notice of such
sale. At any such sale, the Trust Indenture Estate
may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate
lots. The Indenture Trustee shall have and may
exercise with respect to the Collateral any or all of
the rights and remedies of a secured party under the
Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of New
York, and as otherwise granted herein or under any
other applicable law. To the extent permitted by law,
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Owner Trustee expressly waives any notice of sale
or other disposition of Collateral and all other
rights or remedies of the Owner Trustee or formalities
prescribed by law relative to sale or disposition of
Collateral or exercise of any other right or remedy of
the Indenture Trustee with respect to Collateral
existing after default hereunder; and to the extent
any such notice is required and cannot be waived, the
Owner Trustee agrees that if such notice with respect
to Collateral is given at least three (3) days before
the time of the sale or disposition, such notice shall
be deemed reasonable and shall fully satisfy any
requirement for giving of said notice.

The Indenture Trustee shall not be obligated
to make any sale pursuant to notice provided as
contemplated above. The Indenture Trustee may,
without notice or publication, adjourn any public or
private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from
time to time by announcement at the time and place
fixed for such sale, and any such sale may be made at
any time or place to which the same may be so
adjourned without further notice or publication. The
Indenture Trustee may exercise such right of sale
without possession or production of the Certificates
or proof of ownership thereof, and as representative
of the Holders may exercise such right without notice
to the Holders or without including the Holders as
parties to any suit or proceedings relating to the
foreclosure of any part of the Trust Indenture Estate.
The Owner Trustee shall execute any and all such bills
of sale, assignments and other documents, and perform
and do all other acts and things requested by the
Indenture Trustee in order to permit consummation of
any sale of the Trust Indenture Estate in accordance
with this Section 7.03(c) and to effectuate the
transfer or conveyance referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 7.03(c). Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Indenture, the Indenture
Trustee shall not sell the Trust Indenture Estate or
any part thereof unless the Certificates shall have
been accelerated.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Indenture Trustee or any Holder may be a
purchaser of the Trust Indenture Estate or any part
thereof or any interest therein at any sale thereof,
whether pursuant to foreclosure or power of sale or
otherwise. The Indenture Trustee may apply against
the purchase price therefor the amount then due
hereunder or under any of the Certificates secured
hereby and any Holder may apply against the purchase
price therefor the amount then due to it hereunder,
under any other Indenture Document or under the
Certificates held by such Holder to the extent that
such portion of the purchase price as it would have
received had it been entitled to share any
distribution thereof. The Indenture Trustee or any
Holder or nominee thereof shall, upon any such
purchase, acquire good title to the property so
purchased, free of the Lien of this Indenture and, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, free of all
rights of redemption in the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant in respect of the property so purchased.

(e) Subject to Article VIII hereof and if an
Indenture Event of Default is continuing, the Owner
Trustee hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes
the Indenture Trustee the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee in its name and
stead and on its behalf, for the purpose of
effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or

bills of sale, assignments and other instruments as
the Indenture Trustee may consider necessary or
appropriate, with full power of substitution, and the
Owner Trustee hereby ratifies and confirms all that
such attorney or any substitute shall lawfully do by
virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by the
Indenture Trustee or any purchaser, the Owner Trustee
shall ratify and confirm any such sale, assignment,
transfer or delivery, by executing and delivering to
the Indenture Trustee or such purchaser all bills of
sale, assignments, releases and other proper
instruments to effect such ratification and

(f) The Indenture Trustee shall, as a matter
of right, be entitled to the appointment of a receiver
(who may be the Indenture Trustee or any successor or
nominee) for all or any part of the Trust Indenture
Estate, whether such receivership be incidental to a
proposed sale of the Trust Indenture Estate or the
taking of possession thereof or otherwise, and the
Owner Trustee hereby consents to the appointment of
such receiver and will not oppose any such

hereunder, shall be a perpetual bar against the Owner
Trustee after the expiration of the period, if any,
during which the Owner Trustee shall have the benefit
of prepayment laws which may not be waived pursuant to
Section 7.13 hereof.

SECTION 7.04. Indenture Trustee May Prove
Debt. If the Owner Trustee shall fail to pay any
amount payable hereunder or under the Certificates,
the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as trustee
of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered
to institute any action or proceedings at law or in
equity for the collection of the sums so due and
unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceed-
ings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any
such judgment or final decree against the Owner
Trustee and collect in the manner provided by law out
of the property of the Owner Trustee wherever
situated, the moneys adjudged or decreed to be
payable; provided, that any sale of any portion of the
Trust Indenture Estate shall be done in accordance
with Section 7.03(c) hereof.

In case there shall be pending proceedings
relative to the Owner Trustee or the Lessor's Estate
under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable
federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or
trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator,
sequestrator or similar official shall have been
appointed for or taken possession of the Lessor's
Estate or the Owner Trustee or its property, or in
case of any other comparable judicial proceedings
relative to the Lessor's Estate or the Owner Trustee,
or to the creditors or property of the Lessor's Estate
or the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
irrespective of whether the principal of the
Certificates shall then be due and payable as therein
or herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Indenture Trustee shall
have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of
this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:

(a) to file and prove a claim or claims for
the whole amount of principal, interest and other
amounts owing and unpaid in respect of the
Certificates or hereunder, and to file such other
papers or documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the
Indenture Trustee (including any claim for
reasonable compensation to the Indenture Trustee
and each predecessor Indenture Trustee, and their
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for
reimbursement of the Indenture Trustee and each
predecessor Indenture Trustee, except as a result
of negligence or bad faith) and of the Holders
allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to
the Owner Trustee or to the creditors or property
of the Owner Trustee,

(b) unless prohibited by applicable law and
regulations, to vote on behalf of the Holders in
any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in
arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or person
performing similar functions in comparable
proceedings, and

(c) to collect and receive any moneys or
other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims, and to distribute all amounts received
with respect to the claims of the Holders and of
the Indenture Trustee on their behalf;

and any trustee, receiver, or liquidator, custodian or
other similar official is hereby authorized by each of
the Holders to make payments to the Indenture Trustee,
and, in the event that the Indenture Trustee shall
consent to the making of payments directly to the
Holders, to pay to the Indenture Trustee such amounts
as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable
compensation to the Indenture Trustee, each
predecessor Indenture Trustee and their respective
agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses
and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by
the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor Indenture
Trustee except as a result of negligence or willful
misconduct.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
authorize the Indenture Trustee to authorize or
consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Certificates
or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize
the Indenture Trustee to vote in respect of the claim
of any Holder in any such proceeding except, as
aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in
bankruptcy or similar person.

All rights of action and of asserting claims
under this Indenture, under any of the Certificates or
under the Collateral Agreement, may be prosecuted and
enforced by the Indenture Trustee without the
possession of any of the Certificates or the
production thereof in any trial or other proceedings
relative thereto, and any such action or proceedings
instituted by the Indenture Trustee shall be brought
in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and
any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of
the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the
Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee
and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be
for the ratable benefit of the Holders.

In any proceedings brought by the Indenture
Trustee (and also any proceedings involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Indenture or
the Collateral Agreement to which the Indenture
Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall
be held to represent all the Holders of the Certifi-
cates, and it shall not be necessary to make any
Holders parties to any such proceedings.

SECTION 7.05. Remedies Cumulative. Each and
every right, power and remedy given to the Indenture
Trustee specifically or otherwise in this Indenture or
the Collateral Agreement shall be cumulative and shall
be in addition to every other right, power and remedy
specifically given herein or in the Collateral
Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law, in
equity or by statute, and each and every right, power
and remedy whether specifically given herein or in the
Collateral Agreement or otherwise existing may be
exercised from time to time and as often and in such
order as may be deemed expedient by the Indenture
Trustee or the Holders, and the exercise or the
beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy shall
not constitute or be construed to be a waiver of the
right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any
other right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by
the Indenture Trustee or of any Holder in the exercise
of any right, remedy or power or in the pursuance of
any remedy shall impair any such right, power or
remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default
on the part of the Owner Trustee or the Lessee or to
be an acquiescence therein.

SECTION 7.06. Suits for Enforcement. If an
Indenture Event of Default has occurred, has not been
waived and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may in
its discretion and subject to its rights of
appropriate indemnification under Sections 7.08 and
9.03 and Article XI hereof proceed to protect and
enforce its rights and rights of the Holders by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Indenture
Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and
enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity
or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the
specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise
of any power granted in this Indenture or in the
Collateral Agreement or to enforce any other legal or
equitable right vested in the Indenture Trustee or the
Holders by this Indenture or the Collateral Agreement
or by law; provided, that any sale of any portion of
the Trust Indenture Estate shall be done in accordance
with Section 7.03(c) hereof.

SECTION 7.07. Discontinuance of Proceedings.
In case the Indenture Trustee or any Holder shall have
instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power
or remedy under this Indenture or the Collateral
Agreement by foreclosure, entry or otherwise, and such
proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned
for any reason or shall have been determined adversely
to the Indenture Trustee or such Holder, then and in
every such case the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee, the Holders and the Lessee shall, subject to
any determination in such proceeding, be restored to
their former positions and rights hereunder with
respect to the Trust Indenture Estate, and all rights,
remedies and powers of the Indenture Trustee and the
Holders shall continue as if no such proceeding had
been instituted.

SECTION 7.08. Limitations on Suits by
Holders. No Holder of any Certificate shall have any
right by virtue or by availing of any provision of
this Indenture or the Collateral Agreement to insti-
tute any action or proceeding at law or in equity or
in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with
respect to this Indenture or the Collateral Agreement,
or for the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official or for
any other remedy hereunder or under the Collateral
Agreement, unless such Holder previously shall have
given to the Indenture Trustee written notice of an
Indenture Event of Default and of the continuance
thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and the Holders of
not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of
Outstanding Certificates shall have made written
request upon the Indenture Trustee to institute such
action or proceedings in its own name as trustee
hereunder and shall have offered to the Indenture
Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred therein or thereby and the Indenture Trustee
for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request
and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute
any such action or proceedings and no direction
inconsistent with such written request shall have been
given to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section
7.10 hereof; it being understood and intended, and
being expressly covenanted by the Holder of each
Certificate with every other Holder of each other
Certificate and the Indenture Trustee, that no one or
more Holders shall have any right in any manner
whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of
any other Holder or the Lien of this Indenture or any
part of the Trust Indenture Estate or to obtain or
seek to obtain priority over or preference to any
other such Holder or to enforce any right under this
Indenture or the Collateral Agreement, except in the
manner provided herein or therein and for the equal,
ratable and common benefit of all Holders. For the
protection and enforcement of the provisions of this
Section, each and every Holder and the Indenture
Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be
given either at law or in equity.

SECTION 7.09. Unconditional Right of Holders
to Receive Principal, Interest and Make-Whole
Premium, and to Institute Certain Suits.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture,
in the Collateral Agreement or any Certificate, the
right of any Holder to receive payment of the
principal of and interest and Make-Whole Premium, if
any, on such Certificate on or after the respective
due dates and in the manner expressed in such
Certificate, or, subject to Section 7.08 hereof, to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment
on or after such respective dates as provided herein,
shall not be impaired or affected without the consent
of such Holder.

SECTION 7.10. Control by Holders. The
Majority in Interest of Certificate Holders shall have
the right to direct the Indenture Trustee as to the
time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Indenture Trustee by this Indenture or the Collateral
Agreement; provided that such direction shall not be
otherwise than in accordance with law and the
provisions of this Indenture and the Indenture Trustee
shall have received, to the extent provided in
Sections 7.08 and 9.03 and Article XI hereof, such
reasonable indemnification as it may require against
the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred by
the Indenture Trustee; and provided further that
(subject to the provisions of Section 9.02 hereof) the
Indenture Trustee shall have the right to decline to
follow any such direction if the Indenture Trustee,
being advised by counsel, shall determine that the
action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be
taken or if the Indenture Trustee in good faith by its
board of directors, the executive committee, or a
trust committee of directors or Responsible Officers
of the Indenture Trustee shall determine that the
action or proceedings so directed would involve the
Indenture Trustee in personal liability or if the
Indenture Trustee in good faith shall so determine
that the actions or forebearances specified in or
pursuant to such direction shall be unduly prejudicial
to the interests of Holders not joining in the giving
of said direction, it being understood that (subject
to Section 9.02 hereof) the Indenture Trustee shall
have no duty to ascertain whether or not such actions
or forebearances are unduly prejudicial to such
Holders.

Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the
right of the Indenture Trustee in its discretion to
take any action deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee
and which is not inconsistent with the direction by
the Majority in Interest of Certificate Holders or
this Indenture.

SECTION 7.11. Waiver of Past Indenture
Default. Upon written instructions from the Majority
in Interest of Certificate Holders, the Indenture
Trustee shall waive any past Indenture Default and its
consequences and upon any such waiver such Indenture
Default shall cease to exist and any Indenture Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have
been cured for every purpose of this Indenture, but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
Indenture Default or impair any right consequent
thereon; provided, however, that in the absence of
written instructions from all Holders, the Indenture
Trustee shall not waive any Indenture Default (a) in
the payment of the principal of, or Make-Whole
Premium, if any, or interest on, or other amounts due
under, any Certificate then Outstanding, or (b) in
respect of a covenant or provision hereof which, under
Article XIII hereof, cannot be modified or amended
without the consent of each Holder.

SECTION 7.12. Notice of Indenture Default.
The Indenture Trustee shall transmit to the Owner
Trustee, the Holders and to the Owner Participant
notice of all Indenture Defaults actually known to a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee, such
notice to be transmitted by mail to the Holders within
90 days, and to the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant promptly after the occurrence thereof,
unless such Indenture Default shall have been cured
before the giving of such notice; provided that under
no circumstances shall the Indenture Trustee give such
notice to the Holders until the expiration of a period
of 60 days from the occurrence of such Indenture
Default; and provided further that, except in the case
of default in the payment of the principal of or
interest on or any other amount due under any of the
Certificates, the Indenture Trustee shall be protected
in withholding such notice to the Holders if and so
long as the board of directors, the executive
committee, or a trust committee of directors or
trustees and/or Responsible Officers of the Indenture
Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding
of such notice is in the interests of the Holders.

SECTION 7.13. Waiver of Appraisement, etc.;
Laws. The Owner Trustee covenants (to the extent that
it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time
insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever
claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any
appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, redemption
or prepayment law wherever enacted, now or at any time
hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the
enforcement of this Indenture or the execution of any
power granted herein or therein to the Indenture
Trustee, or the absolute sale of the Trust Indenture
Estate, or any part thereof, or the possession thereof
by any purchaser at any sale under this Article VII;
and the Owner Trustee for itself and all who may claim
under it, so far as it or any of them now or hereafter
lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all such
laws. The Owner Trustee for itself and all who may
claim under it waives, to the extent that it lawfully
may, all right to have the property in the Trust
Indenture Estate marshalled upon any foreclosure
hereof, and agrees that any court having jurisdiction
to foreclose this Indenture may order the sale of the
Trust Indenture Estate as an entirety.

If any law referred to in this Section 7.13
and now in force, of which the Owner Trustee or its
successors might take advantage despite this Section
7.13, shall hereafter be repealed or cease to be in
force, such law shall not thereafter be deemed to
constitute any part of the contract herein contained
or to preclude the application of this Section 7.13.

SECTION 8.02. Owner Participant's Right to
Elect to Prepay or Purchase the Certificates. (a) In
the event that (A) at any time one or more Events of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing for a
period of 180 days or more but less than one year (or
a period of less than 180 days if any such Event of
Default shall be an Event of Default under Section
16.01(a) of the Lease) and the Certificates shall not
have been accelerated or (B) the Certificates shall
have been accelerated pursuant to Section 7.02(b) or
7.02(c) hereof or after one or more Events of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing for a period of
one year or more (or a period of 180 days or more if
such Event of Default shall be an Event of Default
under Section 16.01(a) of the Lease), the Owner
Participant (or the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Owner Participant) may, but shall be under no
obligation to, do either of the following:

(1) direct the Owner Trustee to cause the
prepayment of all, but not less than all, of the
Certificates then Outstanding by notifying the
Indenture Trustee of such election, which notice
in order to be effective shall state that it is
irrevocable and shall designate a Prepayment Date
which shall be a Rent Payment Date or monthly
anniversary thereof and which shall be not less
than 30 days after the date of such notice on
which the Owner Trustee shall, in the manner
provided for in Section 6.04 hereof, deposit the
sum of amounts contemplated by paragraph "first"
under Section 5.03 and the aggregate Prepayment
Price of all such Certificates with the Indenture
Trustee. If such payment by the Owner Trustee to
the Indenture Trustee is made, the Certificates
shall cease to accrue interest from and after the
Prepayment Date, and after distribution of such
payment to the Holders, the Indenture Trustee
shall release the Trust Indenture Estate from the
Lien of this Indenture; or

(2) purchase all, but not less than all, of
the Outstanding Certificates by notifying the
Indenture Trustee of such election, which notice
in order to be effective shall state that it is
irrevocable and shall designate a date which
shall be a Rent Payment Date or monthly
anniversary thereof and which shall be not less
than 30 days after the date of such notice on
which the Owner Trustee shall pay to the
Indenture Trustee an amount equal to the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all
Outstanding Certificates, together with accrued
interest on such amount to the date of purchase,
the aggregate amount of any Make-Whole Premium in
the case of a purchase pursuant to clause (A)
above, plus all other sums due any Holder or the
Indenture Trustee hereunder or under the
Participation Agreement or the Lease. Upon
receipt by the Indenture Trustee of such amount,
each Holder will be deemed, whether or not
Certificates shall have been delivered to the
Indenture Trustee on such date, to have thereupon
sold, assigned, transferred and conveyed (and, if
such Holder is the Pass Through Trustee, shall
promptly take such actions as the Owner
Participant shall reasonably request to evidence
such sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance)
to the Owner Participant (without recourse or
warranty of any kind except for its own acts),
all of the right, title and interest of such
Holder in and to the Trust Indenture Estate, this
Indenture, and the Participation Agreement and
all Certificates held by such Holder and the
former Holders shall not be entitled to receive
any interest on the principal amount of such
Certificates after the date on which such
purchase is effected (and payment of the purchase
price is made), and the Owner Participant shall
be deemed to have assumed (and shall promptly
take such actions as any Holder shall reasonably
request to evidence such assumption) all of such
Holder's obligations under the Participation
Agreement, the Certificates and this Indenture
arising upon or subsequent to such sale. If the
Owner Trustee shall so request, such Holder will
comply with all the provisions of Section 2.06 of
this Indenture to enable new Certificates to be
issued to the Owner Participant in such
authorized denominations as the Owner Participant
shall request. All charges and expenses required
pursuant to Section 2.06 hereof in connection
with the issuance of any such new Certificates
shall be borne by the Owner Participant.

(b) From and after the deposit by the Owner
Trustee of the applicable Prepayment Price or purchase
price with the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section
8.02(a) hereof, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
exercise all remedies of the Indenture Trustee under
Article VII hereof as well as of the Lessor under the
Lease.

SECTION 8.03. Certain Rights of Owner
Participant. (a) If (A) there shall occur an Event
of Default under the Lease as a result of the Lessee's
failure to make any payment of an installment of Basic
Rent, and (B) the Owner Trustee shall have paid or
caused to be paid at any time prior to the day which
is the later of (x) the 11th day subsequent to notice
of such failure by the Indenture Trustee to the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant and (y) the sixth day
subsequent to the expiration of the grace period
provided for in Section 16.01(a) of the Lease all
principal and interest on the Certificates then due
(as well as any interest on overdue principal and (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) interest), but
not including any principal or interest becoming due
on account of such Event of Default, then the failure
of the Lessee to make the payment of such installment
of Basic Rent or of interest on account of such
installment's being overdue shall not, constitute an
Indenture Event of Default under Section 7.01(a)
hereof and any declaration based solely on the same
shall be deemed to be automatically rescinded.
Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall be
deemed to entitle the Owner Trustee to declare the
Lease to be in default or to exercise any rights and
powers or pursue any remedies pursuant to Article 17
of the Lease or otherwise, except that the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant may attempt to
recover any amount paid by it or them under this
Indenture by demanding of the Lessee payment of such
amount, or by commencing an action at law against the
Lessee for the payment of such amount or taking
appropriate action in a pending action at law against
the Lessee pursuant to Section 17.01(a)(v), but only
said Section 17.01(a)(v), of the Lease. Upon curing
any such Event of Default pursuant to this Section
8.03, the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, as
the case may be, shall, so long as no Indenture Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be
subrogated on an unsecured basis to all the rights of
the Indenture Trustee under the Lease in respect of
the payment giving rise to such cured Event of
Default, and any right to any interest in respect of
the same, and shall be entitled to any payment of
Basic Rent (or interest thereon) actually made by the
Lessee in respect of such cured payment upon receipt
by the Indenture Trustee; provided that no such amount
shall be paid to the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant until all amounts then due and payable to
each Certificate Holder hereunder and thereunder shall
have been paid in full and no Indenture Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture or the
Lease to the contrary, the Owner Participant and the
Owner Trustee collectively, shall not be entitled to
cure more than six (6) Events of Default (no more than
three (3) of which may be consecutive) occasioned by
defaults in the payment of Basic Rent.

(b) If (A) there shall occur an Event of
Default under the Lease for any reason other than the
Lessee's failure to make any payment of an installment
of Basic Rent, (B) such Event of Default is curable by
the payment of money and (C) the Owner Trustee shall
have taken or caused to be taken such action necessary
to cure and shall have cured such Event of Default
prior to the day which is the later of (x) the 11th
day subsequent to notice of such failure by the
Indenture Trustee to the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant and (y) the sixth day subsequent to the
expiration of the grace period, if any, provided with
respect to such failure on the part of the Lessee in
Section 16.01 of the Lease then the failure of the
Lessee to perform such covenant, condition or
agreement, the observance or performance of which was
accomplished by the Owner Trustee hereunder, shall not
constitute an Indenture Event of Default under Sec-
tion 7.01(a)(ii) hereof and any declaration based
solely on the same shall be deemed to be automatically
rescinded. Nothing contained in the preceding
sentence shall be deemed to entitle the Owner Trustee
or the Owner Participant to declare the Lease to be in
default or to exercise any rights and powers or pursue
any remedies pursuant to Article 17 of the Lease or
otherwise, except that the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant may attempt to recover any amount paid by
it or them in effecting such cure by demanding of the
Lessee payment of such amount, or by commencing an
action at law against the Lessee for the payment of
such amount or taking appropriate action in a pending
action at law against the Lessee pursuant to Sec-
tion 17.01(a)(v), but only said Section 17.01(a)(v),
of the Lease. Upon curing any such Event of Default
pursuant to this Section 8.03(b), the Owner Trustee or
the Owner Participant, as the case may be, shall be
subrogated to all the rights of the Indenture Trustee
under the Lease in respect of the payment, agreement
or covenant giving rise to such Event of Default, and
any right to any interest in respect of the same, and
shall be entitled to any payment or other performance
upon receipt by the Indenture Trustee; provided that
no such amount shall be paid to the Owner Trustee or
the Owner Participant until all amounts then due and
payable to each Certificate Holder hereunder and
thereunder shall have been paid in full and no
Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

Article IX

CONCERNING THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

SECTION 9.01. Acceptance of Trusts. The
Indenture Trustee hereby accepts the trusts imposed
upon it by this Indenture, and covenants and agrees to
perform the same as expressed herein and agrees to
receive and disburse all moneys constituting part of
the Trust Indenture Estate in accordance with the
terms hereof.

SECTION 9.02. Duties and Responsibilities
of the Indenture Trustee; During an Indenture Event of
Default; Prior to an Indenture Event of Default. (a)
The Indenture Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an
Indenture Event of Default and after the curing or
waiving of all Indenture Events of Default which may
have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and
only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Indenture. In case an Indenture Event of Default has
occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the
Indenture Trustee shall exercise such of the rights
and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the
same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. No
provision of this Indenture shall be construed to
relieve the Indenture Trustee from liability for its
own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act
or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(i) prior to the occurrence of an Indenture
Event of Default and after the curing or waiving
of all Indenture Events of Default which may have
occurred:

(x) the duties and obligations of the
Indenture Trustee shall be determined solely
by the express provisions of this Indenture,
and the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable
except for the performance of such duties and
obligations as are specifically set forth in
this Indenture, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read in to this
Indenture against the Indenture Trustee; and

(y) in the absence of bad faith on the
part of the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the
truth of the statements and the correctness
of the opinions expressed therein, upon any
statements, certificates or opinions
furnished to the Indenture Trustee and
conforming to the requirements of this
Indenture; but in the case of any such
statements, certificate or opinions which by
any provision hereof are specifically
required to be furnished to the Indenture
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall be under
a duty to examine the same to determine
whether or not they conform to the
requirements of this Indenture;

(ii) the Indenture Trustee shall not be
liable for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible
Officers of the Indenture Trustee, unless it
shall be proved that the Indenture Trustee was
negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
and

(iii) the Indenture Trustee shall not be
liable with respect to any action taken or not
taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
direction of the Holders of not less than a
majority in aggregate principal amount of
Outstanding Certificates relating to the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or
exercising any trust or power conferred upon the
Indenture Trustee, under this Indenture.

None of the provisions contained in this
Indenture shall require the Indenture Trustee to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur
personal financial liability in the performance of any
of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights
or powers, if the Indenture Trustee shall have
determined in good faith that the repayment of such
funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is
not reasonably assured to it.

The Indenture Trustee will execute and the
Owner Trustee will file or cause to be filed such
continuation statements with respect to financing
statements relating to the security interest created
hereunder in the Trust Indenture Estate as may be
specified from time to time in written instructions of
the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate
principal amount of Outstanding Certificates (which
instructions may, by their terms, be operative only at
a future date and which shall be accompanied by the
execution form of such continuation statement so to be
filed); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indenture Trustee may execute and file or cause to
be filed any financing statement which it from time to
time deems appropriate.

(b) If any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and on request of the
Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal
amount of Outstanding Certificates and subject to
indemnification, to the extent provided in Sections
7.08 and 9.03 and Article XI hereof, as it may require
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred, the Indenture Trustee shall exercise such
remedies under Article 17 of the Lease as shall be
specified in such request.

(c) The Indenture Trustee agrees that it
will, in its individual capacity and at its own cost
and expense (but without any right of indemnity in
respect of any such cost or expense under Article XI
hereof) promptly take such action as may be necessary
duly to discharge all Liens on any part of the Trust
Indenture Estate which result from claims against it
in its individual capacity not related to the
administration of the Trust Indenture Estate or any
other transaction pursuant to this Indenture or any
document included in the Trust Indenture Estate.

(d) The Indenture Trustee will execute and
deliver to the Lessee for filing in accordance with
Section 18 of the Lease any properly presented
document, instrument or financing or continuation
statement specified in any opinion delivered pursuant
to Section 6.03(e) of the Participation Agreement.
The Indenture Trustee may rely on the act of
presentation of any such document, instrument,
financing or continuation statement as evidencing the
fact that it is properly prepared and presented,
provided that the Indenture Trustee shall promptly
correct any error in any such document, instrument,
financing or continuation statement of which a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee has
actual knowledge.

(e) The Indenture Trustee will furnish to
each Holder promptly upon receipt thereof, duplicates
or copies of all reports, notices, requests, demands,
certificates, financial statements and other
instruments furnished to the Indenture Trustee, to the
extent that the same shall not have been otherwise
furnished to such Holder pursuant to this Indenture or
to the extent the Indenture Trustee does not
reasonably believe that the same shall have been fur-
nished by the Lessee directly to such Holder.

SECTION 9.03. Certain Rights of the
Indenture Trustee. Subject to Section 9.02 hereof:

(a) the Indenture Trustee may rely and
shall be protected in acting or refraining from
acting upon any resolution, officer's certificate
or any other certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
bond, debenture, note, coupon, security or other
paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties;

(b) any request, direction, order or demand
of the Owner Trustee mentioned herein shall be
sufficiently evidenced by an officer's
certificate (unless other evidence in respect
thereof be herein specifically prescribed) upon
which the Indenture Trustee may rely to prove or
establish a matter set forth therein;

(c) the Indenture Trustee may consult with
counsel and any advice or opinion of counsel
shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with such advice
or opinion of counsel;

(d) the Indenture Trustee shall be under no
obligation to exercise any of the trusts or
powers vested in it by this Indenture at the
request, order or direction of any of the Holders
pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture,
unless such Holders shall have offered to the
Indenture Trustee reasonable security or
indemnity against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which might be incurred therein or
thereby;

(e) the Indenture Trustee shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it in
good faith and believed by it to be authorized or
within the discretion, rights or powers conferred
upon it by this Indenture;

(f) prior to the occurrence of an Indenture
Event of Default hereunder and after the curing
or waiving of all Indenture Events of Default,
the Indenture Trustee shall not be bound to make
any investigation into the facts or matters
stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
consent, order, approval, appraisal, bond,
debenture, note, coupon, security, or other paper
or document unless requested in writing to do so
by the Majority in Interest of Certificate
Holders; provided that, if the payment within a
reasonable time to the Indenture Trustee of the
costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be
incurred by it in the making of such inves-
tigation is, in the opinion of the Indenture
Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Indenture
Trustee by the security afforded to it by the
terms of this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee
may require reasonable indemnity against such
expenses or liabilities as a condition to
proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such
examination shall be paid by the Owner Trustee
or, if paid by the Indenture Trustee or any
predecessor trustee, shall be repaid by the Owner
Trustee upon demand; and

(g) the Indenture Trustee may execute any
of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any
duties hereunder either directly or by or through
agents or attorneys not regularly in its employ
and the Indenture Trustee shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on
the part of any such agent or attorney appointed
with due care by it hereunder.

SECTION 9.04. Indenture Trustee Not
Responsible for Recitals, Disposition of Certificates
or Application of Proceeds Thereof. The Indenture
Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness
of the recitals contained herein and in the
Certificates, except the Indenture Trustee's
certificates of authentication. The Indenture
Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Certificates.
The Indenture Trustee shall not be accountable for the
use or application by the Owner Trustee of any of the
Certificates or of the proceeds thereof.

SECTION 9.05. Indenture Trustee and Agents
May Hold Certificates; Collections, etc. The
Indenture Trustee or any agent of the Indenture
Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may
become the owner or pledgee of Certificates with the
same rights it would have if it were not the Indenture
Trustee or such agent and may otherwise deal with the
Owner Trustee and receive, collect, hold and retain
collections from the Owner Trustee with the same
rights it would have if it were not the Indenture
Trustee or such agent.

SECTION 9.06. Moneys Held by Indenture
Trustee. Subject to Sections 5.08 hereof and 14.04
hereof, all moneys received by the Indenture Trustee
shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be
held in trust for the purposes for which they were
received, but need not be segregated from other funds
except to the extent required by mandatory provisions
of law. Neither the Owner Trustee nor, subject to
Section 5.08 hereof, the Indenture Trustee nor any
agent thereof shall be under any liability for
interest on any moneys received by it hereunder.

SECTION 9.07. Right of Indenture Trustee to
Rely on Officers' Certificate, etc. Subject to
Sections 9.02 and 9.03 hereof, whenever in the
administration of the trusts of this Indenture the
Indenture Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable
that a matter be proved or established prior to taking
or suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such
matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be
specifically prescribed herein) may, in the absence of
bad faith on the part of the Indenture Trustee, be
deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an
officer's certificate delivered to the Indenture
Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of bad
faith on the part of the Indenture Trustee, shall be
full warrant to the Indenture Trustee for any action
taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions
of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

SECTION 9.08. Replacement Engines. At any
time and from time to time any Engine which has been
subject to an Event of Loss and which may, or which is
required to, be replaced under Section 10.03, or 11.04
of the Lease by a Replacement Engine, shall be
replaced in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9.08 and the provisions of said Sections of
the Lease, the Owner Trustee shall, from time to time,
direct the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
or as directed in writing by the Owner Trustee an
appropriate instrument releasing such Engine as
appropriate from the Lien of this Indenture and the
Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver such
instrument as aforesaid without recourse or warranty,
but only upon receipt by or deposit with the Indenture
Trustee of the following:

(1) A written request from the Owner Trustee
requesting such release and specifically
describing the Engine(s) to be so released.

(2) A certificate signed by a duly
authorized officer of the Lessee stating the
following:

(i) a description of the Engine subject
to the Event of Loss including the
manufacturer's serial number;

(ii) a description of the Replacement
Engine including the manufacturer's name, the
engine model and serial number;

(iii) that on the date of the Indenture
and Security Agreement Supplement relating to
the Replacement Engine the Owner Trustee will
be the legal owner of such Replacement Engine
free and clear of all Liens except Liens
permitted under Section 6.01 of the Lease,
and that such Replacement Engine will on such
date be in at least as good operating
condition and repair as required by the terms
of the Lease;

(iv) that the value of the Replacement
Engine as of the date of such certificate is
not less than the value of the Engine to be
released (assuming such Engine was in the
condition and repair required to be
maintained under the Lease);

(v) that the release of the Engine
subject to the Event of Loss will not impair
the security of the Indenture in
contravention of any of the provisions of
this Indenture;

(vi) that upon such replacement, the
Lien of this Indenture will apply to the
Replacement Engine; and

(vii) that each of the conditions
specified in Section 10.03 or 11.04 of the
Lease with respect to such Replacement Engine
has been satisfied.

(3) The appropriate instruments (i)
transferring to the Owner Trustee title to the
Replacement Engine to be received as
consideration for the Engine to be released and
(ii) assigning to the Owner Trustee the benefit
of all manufacturer's and vendor's warranties, if
any, generally available with respect to such
Replacement Engine, and an Indenture and Security
Agreement Supplement subjecting such Replacement
Engine to the Trust Agreement and to the Lien of
this Indenture.

(4) The opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell,
special counsel to the Lessee, or other counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee,
stating that:

(i) the certificates, opinions and
other instruments and/or property which have
been or are therewith delivered to and
deposited with the Indenture Trustee conform
to the requirements of this Indenture and the
Lease and, upon the basis of such
application, the property so sold or disposed
of may be properly released from the Lien of
this Indenture and all conditions precedent
herein provided for relating to such release
have been complied with; and

(ii) the Replacement Engine has been
validly subjected to the Lien of this
Indenture and covered by the Lease, the
instruments subjecting such Replacement
Engine to the Lease and to the Lien of this
Indenture, as the case may be, have been duly
filed for recordation pursuant to the Avia-
tion Act or any other law then applicable to
the registration of the Aircraft, and no
further action, filing or recording of any
document is necessary or advisable in order
to establish and perfect the title of the
Owner Trustee to, and to establish and
perfect the Lien of this Indenture on, such
Replacement Engine and the Indenture Trustee
should be entitled to the benefits of Section
1110 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to
such Replacement Engine, provided, that such
opinion need not be to the effect specified
in the foregoing clause to the extent that
the benefits of such Section 1110 would not
have been, by reason of a change in law or
governmental interpretation thereof after the
date hereof, available to the Indenture
Trustee with respect to the Aircraft
immediately prior to such substitution had
such Event of Loss not occurred.

SECTION 9.09. Indenture and Security
Agreement Supplement for Replacements. In the event
of the substitution of a Replacement Engine as
contemplated by Section 10.03 or Article 11 of the
Lease, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
agree for the benefit of the Holders and the Lessee,
subject to fulfillment of the conditions precedent and
compliance by the Lessee with its obligations set
forth in Section 10.03 or Article 11 of the Lease, to
execute and deliver an Indenture and Security
Agreement Supplement as contemplated by Sec-
tion 9.08(3) hereof and, provided no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, execute and
deliver to the Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing the Engine being replaced from the Lien of
this Indenture.

SECTION 9.10. Effect of Replacement. In
the event of the substitution of a Replacement Engine
as contemplated by Section 10.01 or Article 11 of the
Lease and Section 9.08 hereof, all provisions of this
Indenture relating to the Engine or Engines being
replaced shall be applicable to such Replacement
Engine or Engines with the same force and effect as if
such Replacement Engine or Engines were the same
engine or engines, as the case may be, as the Engine
or Engines being replaced but for the Event of Loss
with respect to the Engine being replaced.

SECTION 9.11. Compensation. The Owner
Trustee covenants and agrees to pay, and the Indenture
Trustee shall be entitled to receive, reasonable fees,
compensation and payment or reimbursement for its
reasonable advances, expenses and disbursements
(including the reasonable compensation and expenses
and disbursements of its counsel, agents and other
persons not regularly in its employ) in connection
with its services rendered hereunder or in any way
relating to or arising out of the administration of
the Trust Indenture Estate and shall have a priority
claim on the Trust Indenture Estate for the payment of
such compensation, advances, expenses and
disbursements to the extent that such compensation,
advances, expenses and disbursements shall not be paid
by the Lessee or the Owner Participant, and shall have
the right to use or apply any moneys held by it
hereunder in the Trust Indenture Estate toward such
payments; provided that, so long as the Lease is in
effect, the Indenture Trustee shall not make any claim
for payment under this Section 9.11 against the Owner
Trustee without first making demand on the Lessee for
payment of such claim. The Indenture Trustee agrees
that it shall have no right against any Holder, First
Security or (except as provided in the Participation
Agreement) to the Owner Participant for any fee as
compensation for its services as trustee under this
Indenture.

Article X

CONCERNING THE HOLDERS

SECTION 10.01. Evidence of Action Taken by
Holders. (a) Any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by
Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or
more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed
by such Holders in person or by an agent duly
appointed in writing, and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, such action shall become
effective when such instrument or instruments are
delivered to the Indenture Trustee and, if expressly
required herein, to the Owner Trustee. Proof of
execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing
any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of
this Indenture and (subject to Sections 9.02 and 9.03
hereof) conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee
and the Owner Trustee, if made in the manner provided
in this Article.

(b) For the purpose of determining the
Holders entitled to vote or consent to any direction,
waiver or other action of such Holders under
Section 7.10 or 7.11 hereof, the Lessee may set a
record date for such vote or consent by specifying
such record date in an Officer's Certificate delivered
to the Indenture Trustee. Such record date shall be a
date not more than 15 days prior to the first
solicitation of such vote or consent.

SECTION 10.02. Proof of Execution of
Instruments and of Holding of Certificates. Subject
to Sections 9.02 and 9.03 hereof, the execution of any
instrument by a Holder or his agent or proxy may be
proved in accordance with such reasonable rules and
regulations as may be prescribed by the Indenture
Trustee. The holding of Certificates shall be proved
by the Register or by a certificate of the Registrar.

SECTION 10.03. Holders to Be Treated as
Owners. Prior to due presentment for registration of
transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee, any agent of the Owner Trustee or
the Indenture Trustee, the Paying Agent, if any, the
Registrar and the Lessee may deem and treat the Person
in whose name such Certificate shall be registered
upon the Register as the absolute owner of such
Certificate (whether or not such Certificate shall be
overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership
or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving
payment of or on account of the principal of and,
subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest
on such Certificate and for all other purposes; and
neither the Owner Trustee nor the Indenture Trustee
(nor any agent of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee) nor the Paying Agent, if any, nor the
Registrar nor the Lessee shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to
any such person, or upon his order, shall be valid,
and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid,
effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for
moneys payable upon any such Certificate.

SECTION 10.04. Certificates Owned by Owner
Trustee, Owner Participant and the Lessee Deemed Not
Outstanding. In determining whether the Holders of
the requisite aggregate principal amount of
Certificates have concurred in any direction, consent
or waiver under this Indenture, Certificates which are
owned by the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant,
First Security, the Lessee or by any person directly
or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under
direct or indirect common control with the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Participant, First Security or the
Lessee shall be disregarded and deemed not to be
Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination;
provided that for the purpose of determining whether
the Indenture Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, consent or waiver, only if a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee has
actual knowledge that certain Certificates are so
owned by any person directly or indirectly controlling
or controlled by or under direct or indirect common
control with the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant,
First Security shall such Certificates be so
disregarded; and provided further that if all
Certificates which would be deemed Outstanding in the
absence of the foregoing provision are owned by the
Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant, First Security
or the Lessee or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or
indirect common control with the Owner Trustee, the
Owner Participant, First Security or the Lessee, then
such Certificates shall be deemed Outstanding for the
purpose of any such determination. Certificates so
owned which have been pledged in good faith may be
regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to
the satisfaction of the Indenture Trustee the
pledgee's right so to act with respect to such
Certificates and that the pledgee is not the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Participant, First Security or the
Lessee or any Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or
indirect common control with the Owner Trustee, the
Owner Participant, First Security or the Lessee. In
case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of
counsel shall be full protection in respect of any
decision made by the Indenture Trustee in accordance
with such advice, unless the Lessee, the Owner
Trustee, First Security, or the Owner Participant are
actually named in the Register. Upon request of the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant, First Security and the Lessee shall
furnish to the Indenture Trustee promptly an officer's
certificate listing and identifying all Certificates,
if any, known by the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant, First Security or the Lessee to be owned
or held by or for the account of any of the
above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 9.02
and 9.03 hereof, the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to accept such officer's certificate as
conclusive evidence of the facts set forth therein and
of the fact that all Certificates not listed therein
are outstanding for the purpose of any such
determination.

SECTION 10.05. Right of Revocation of
Action Taken. At any time prior to (but not after)
the evidencing to the Indenture Trustee, as provided
in Section 10.01, of the taking of any action by the
Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal
amount of the Certificates specified in this Indenture
in connection with such action, any Holder of a
Certificate, the serial number of which is shown by
the evidence to be included among the serial numbers
of the Certificates the Holders of which have
consented to such action, may, by filing written
notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of
holding as provided in this Article, revoke such
action so far as concerns such Certificate. Except as
aforesaid, any such action taken by the Holder shall
be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon
all future Holders and owners of such Certificate and
of any Certificates issued in exchange or substitution
therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation
in regard thereto is made upon any such Certificate or
otherwise. Any action taken by the Holders of the
percentage in aggregate principal amount of the
Certificates specified in this Indenture in connection
with such action shall be conclusively binding upon
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the
Holders of all the Certificates.

SECTION 10.06. ERISA Plan Prohibition. No
employee benefit plan subject to Title I of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), or individual retirement account or
plan subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, or any trust established
under any such plan or account (hereinafter
collectively referred to as an "ERISA Plan"), may
acquire or hold any of the Certificates. The purchase
by any person of any Certificate constitutes a
representation by such person to the Lessee, the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee that such person is not an ERISA Plan and that
such person is not acquiring, and has not acquired,
such Certificate with assets of an ERISA Plan.

Article XI

INDEMNIFICATION OF INDENTURE
TRUSTEE BY OWNER TRUSTEE

The Owner Trustee, not individually but
solely in its capacity as Owner Trustee under the
Trust Agreement, hereby agrees, whether or not any of
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consummated, to assume liability for, and does hereby
indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless the
Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity, and its
successors, assigns, agents and servants solely from
the Lessor's Estate, with respect to the claims of the
Indenture Trustee for payment or reimbursement under
Section 9.11 hereof and from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
taxes (excluding any taxes payable by the Indenture
Trustee on or measured by any compensation received by
the Indenture Trustee for its services under this
Indenture), claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements (including legal fees and expenses) of
any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Indenture
Trustee (whether or not also agreed to be indemnified
against by any other person under any other document)
in any way relating to or arising out of this
Indenture, or any other Indenture Documents or the
enforcement of any of the terms of any thereof, or in
any way relating to or arising out of the manufacture,
purchase, acceptance, nonacceptance, rejection,
ownership, delivery, lease, possession, use,
operation, condition, modification, maintenance, sale,
return or other disposition of the Aircraft or any
Engine (including, without limitation, latent and
other defects, whether or not discoverable, and any
claim for patent, trademark or copyright
infringement), or in any way relating to or arising
out of the administration of the Trust Indenture
Estate or the action or inaction of the Indenture
Trustee hereunder, except only (a) in the case of
willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
Indenture Trustee in the performance of its duties
hereunder, (b) as may result from the inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty of the Indenture
Trustee in the Participation Agreement, (c) as other-
wise provided in Section 9.02(c) hereof or (d) as
otherwise excluded by the terms of Article 8 or
Article 9 of the Participation Agreement from the
Lessee's general indemnity to the Indenture Trustee
under said Section; provided that so long as the Lease
is in effect, the Indenture Trustee shall not make any
claim under this Article XI for any claim or expense
indemnified by the Lessee under the Participation
Agreement without first making demand on the Lessee
for payment of such claim or expense. The Indenture
Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification, from the
Trust Indenture Estate, for any liability, obligation,
loss, damage, penalty, claim, action, suit, cost,
expense or disbursement indemnified against pursuant
to this Article XI to the extent not reimbursed by the
Lessee or others, but without releasing any of them
from their respective agreements of reimbursement; and
to secure the same the Indenture Trustee shall have a
prior Lien on the Trust Indenture Estate. The
indemnities contained in this Article XI shall survive
the termination of this Indenture and the resignation
or removal of the Indenture Trustee. Upon payment in
full by the Owner Trustee of any indemnity pursuant to
this Article XI, the Owner Trustee shall, so long as
no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, be subrogated to the rights of the
Indenture Trustee, if any, in respect of the matter as
to which the indemnity was paid.

Article XII

SUCCESSOR TRUSTEES

SECTION 12.01. Notice of Successor Owner
Trustee. In the case of any appointment of a
successor to the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Trust
Agreement or any merger, conversion, consolidation or
sale of substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, the successor Owner Trustee shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Indenture
Trustee.

SECTION 12.02. Resignation and Removal of
Indenture Trustee; Appointment of Successor. (a) The
Indenture Trustee or any successor thereto may resign
at any time without cause by giving at least 30 days'
prior written notice to the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant, the Lessee and each Holder, such
resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of the
trusteeship by a successor Indenture Trustee. In
addition, the Majority in Interest of the Certificate
Holders or the Owner Trustee, with the consent of the
Lessee and the Majority in Interest of the Certificate
Holders may at any time remove the Indenture Trustee
without cause by an instrument in writing delivered to
the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant,
and the Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee
shall promptly notify each Holder thereof in writing,
such removal to be effective upon the acceptance of
the trusteeship by a successor Indenture Trustee. In
the case of the resignation or removal of the
Indenture Trustee, the Majority in Interest of the
Certificate Holders, or the Owner Trustee, with the
consent of the Lessee and the Majority in Interest of
the Certificate Holders, may appoint a successor
Indenture Trustee by an instrument signed by such
Holders. If a successor Indenture Trustee shall not
have been appointed within 90 days after such notice
of resignation or removal, the Indenture Trustee, the
Owner Trustee, the Lessee, the Owner Participant, or
any Holder may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint a successor Indenture Trustee
to act until such time, if any, as a successor shall
have been appointed as provided above. The successor
Indenture Trustee so appointed by such court shall
immediately and without further act be superseded by
any successor Indenture Trustee appointed as provided
above.

(b) In case at any time any of the following
shall occur:

(i) the Indenture Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of
Section 12.03 hereof and shall fail to resign
after written request therefor by the Owner
Trustee or by any such Holder; or

(ii) the Indenture Trustee shall become
incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or
liquidator of the Indenture Trustee or of its
property shall be appointed, or any public
officer shall take charge or control of the
Indenture Trustee or of its property or affairs
for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation
or liquidation;

then the Owner Trustee may remove the Indenture
Trustee and, with the consent of the Lessee, appoint a
successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate,
executed by a Responsible Officer of the Owner
Trustee, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee so removed and one
copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the
provisions of Section 7.13 hereof, the Pass Through
Trustee (if it is a Holder) or any other Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for at least six months
may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly
situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the removal of the Indenture Trustee and the
appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may
thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem
proper and prescribe, remove the Indenture Trustee and
appoint a successor trustee, which removal and
appointment shall become effective upon acceptance of
appointment by the successor trustee as provided in
Section 12.04 hereof. The successor Indenture Trustee
so appointed by such court shall immediately and
without further act be superseded by any successor
Indenture Trustee appointed as provided above within
one year from the date of appointment by such court.

SECTION 12.03. Persons Eligible for
Appointment as Indenture Trustee. There shall at all
times be an Indenture Trustee hereunder which shall be
a corporation organized and doing business under the
laws of the United States of America or of any State
or the District of Columbia having a combined capital
and surplus of at least $100,000,000, or a direct or
indirect subsidiary of such a corporation, or a member
of a bank holding company group, having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and such
subsidiary or member itself having a capital and
surplus, in the case of the original Indenture Trustee
or an affiliate of the original Indenture Trustee, of
at least $10,000,000 and in any other case of at least
$75,000,000, if there is such an institution willing,
able and legally qualified to perform the duties of
the Indenture Trustee hereunder upon reasonable or
customary terms. Such corporate trustee shall be a
citizen of the United States as defined in Section
101(16) of the Aviation Act, and shall be authorized
under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and
shall be subject to supervision of examination by
Federal, State or District of Columbia authority. If
such corporation publishes reports of condition at
least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements
of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority,
then for the purposes of this Section, the combined
capital and surplus of such corporation shall be
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set
forth in its most recent report of condition so
published. In case at any time the Indenture Trustee
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Indenture Trustee
shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in Section 12.02 hereof.

SECTION 12.04. Acceptance of Appointment by
Successor Trustee. Any successor trustee appointed as
provided in Section 12.02 hereof shall execute and
deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Lessee, and to its
predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation
or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become
effective and such successor trustee, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested
with all rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if
originally named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless,
on the written request of the Owner Trustee or of the
successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then
unpaid, the trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to
Section 14.04 hereof, pay over to the successor
trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder
and shall execute and deliver an instrument
transferring to such successor trustee all such
rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request
of any such successor trustee, the Owner Trustee shall
execute any and all instruments in writing for more
fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such
successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any
trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a
prior claim upon all property or funds held or
collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then
due it pursuant to the provisions of Article XI
hereof.

No successor trustee shall accept appointment
as provided in this Section 12.04 unless at the time
of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 12.03 hereof.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor
trustee as provided in this Section 12.04, the
successor trustee shall mail notice thereof by
first-class mail to the Holders at their last
addresses as they shall appear in the Register, and
shall mail a copy of such notice to the Lessee and the
Owner Trustee. If the acceptance of appointment is
substantially contemporaneous with the resignation,
then the notice called for by the preceding sentence
may be combined with the notice called for by Section
12.02 hereof.

SECTION 12.05. Merger, Conversion,
Consolidation or Succession to Business of Indenture
Trustee. Any corporation into which the Indenture
Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from
any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Indenture Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation
succeeding to the corporate trust business of the
Indenture Trustee, shall be the successor to the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, provided that, anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, such
corporation shall be eligible under the provisions of
Section 12.03 hereof, without the execution or filing
of any paper or any further act on the part of any of
the parties hereto.

In case at the time such successor to the
Indenture Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created
by this Indenture any of the Certificates shall have
been authenticated but not delivered, any such
successor to the Indenture Trustee may adopt the
certificate of authentication of any predecessor
Indenture Trustee and deliver such Certificates so
authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the
Certificates shall not have been authenticated, any
successor to the Indenture Trustee may authenticate
such Certificates either in the name of any
predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor
Indenture Trustee; and in all such cases such
certificate shall have the full force which it is
anywhere in the Certificates or in this Indenture
provided that the certificate of the Indenture Trustee
shall have; provided, that the right to adopt the
certificate of authentication of any predecessor
Indenture Trustee or to authenticate Certificates in
the name of any predecessor Indenture Trustee shall
apply only to its successor or successors by merger,
conversion or consolidation.

SECTION 12.06. Appointment of Separate
Trustees. (a) At any time or times, for the purpose
of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction
in which any part of the Trust Indenture Estate may at
the time be located or in which any action of the
Indenture Trustee may be required to be performed or
taken, the Indenture Trustee, by an instrument in
writing signed by it, may appoint one or more
individuals or corporations to act as a separate
trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee, acting
jointly with the Indenture Trustee, of all or any part
of the Trust Indenture Estate, to the full extent that
local law makes it necessary for such separate trustee
or separate trustees or co-trustee acting jointly with
the Indenture Trustee to act.

(b) The Indenture Trustee and, at the
request of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee,
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
instruments as may be required by the legal
requirements of any jurisdiction or by any such
separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee
for the purpose of more fully confirming such title,
rights or duties to such separate trustee or separate
trustees or co-trustee. Upon the acceptance in
writing of such appointment by any such separate
trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee, it, he or
they shall be vested with such title to the Trust
Indenture Estate or any part thereof, and with such
rights, powers, duties and obligations, as shall be
specified in the instrument of appointment, and such
rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be
conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed
by the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee and
such separate trustee or separate trustees or
co-trustee jointly with the Indenture Trustee subject
to all the terms of this Indenture, except to the
extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which
any particular act or acts are to be performed the
Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified
to perform such act or acts, in which event such
rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be
exercised and performed by such separate trustee or
separate trustees or co-trustee, as the case may be.
Any separate trustee or separate trustees or
co-trustee may, at any time by an instrument in
writing, constitute the Indenture Trustee its or his
attorney-in-fact and agent with full power and
authority to do all acts and things and to exercise
all discretion on its or his behalf and in its or his
name. In case any such separate trustee or co-trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, the title to the Trust Indenture Estate and
all assets, property, rights, powers, duties and
obligations and duties of such separate trustee or
co-trustee shall, so far as permitted by law, vest in
and be exercised by the Indenture Trustee, without the
appointment of a successor to such separate trustee or
co-trustee unless and until a successor is appointed.

(c) All provisions of this Indenture which
are for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee
(including without limitation Article XI hereof) shall
extend to and apply to each separate trustee or
co-trustee appointed pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 12.06.

(d) Every additional trustee and separate
trustee hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be appointed and act and the Indenture Trustee
shall act, subject to the following provisions and
conditions:

(i) all powers, duties, obligations and
rights conferred upon the Indenture Trustee in
respect of the receipt, custody, investment and
payment of moneys shall be exercised solely by
the Indenture Trustee;

(ii) all other rights, powers, duties and
obligations conferred or imposed upon the
Indenture Trustee shall be conferred or imposed
and exercised or performed by the Indenture
Trustee and such additional trustee or trustees
and separate trustee or trustees jointly except
to the extent that under any law of any
jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts
are to be performed, the Indenture Trustee shall
be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act
or acts, in which event such rights, powers,
duties and obligations (including the holding of
title to the Trust Indenture Estate in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by
such additional trustee or trustees or separate
trustee or trustees;

(iii) no power hereby given to, or
exercisable by, any such additional trustee or
separate trustee shall be exercised hereunder by
such additional trustee or separate trustee
except jointly with, or with the consent of, the
Indenture Trustee; and

(iv) no trustee hereunder shall be
personally liable by reason of any act or
omission of any other trustee hereunder.

If at any time the Indenture Trustee shall deem it no
longer necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
such law, the Indenture Trustee shall execute and
deliver an indenture supplemental hereto and all other
instruments and agreements necessary or proper to
remove any additional trustee or separate trustee.

(e) Any request, approval or consent in
writing by the Indenture Trustee to any additional
trustee or separate trustee shall be sufficient
warrant to such additional trustee or separate
trustee, as the case may be, to take such action as
may be so requested, approved or consented to.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 12.06, the powers of any additional
trustee or separate trustee shall not exceed those of
the Indenture Trustee hereunder.

Article XIII

any such additional covenants, restrictions,
conditions or provisions an Indenture Event of
Default permitting the enforcement of all or any
of the several remedies provided herein;
provided, that in respect of any such additional
covenant, restriction, condition or provision
such supplemental indenture may provide for a
particular period of grace after default (which
period may be shorter or longer than that allowed
in the case of other defaults) or may provide for
an immediate enforcement upon such an Indenture
Event of Default or may limit the remedies
available to the Indenture Trustee upon such an
Indenture Event of Default or may limit the right
of not less than the Majority in Interest of
Certificate Holders to waive such an Indenture
Event of Default;

(d) to surrender any rights or power

to the Lien of this Indenture in accordance with
the provisions hereof or with the Lease or to
release from the Lien of this Indenture property
that has been substituted on or removed from the

such purpose;

(h) to effect the re-registration of the
Aircraft pursuant to Section 6.03(b) of the
Participation Agreement; and

(i) to add, eliminate or change any
provision hereunder so long as such action shall
not adversely affect the interests of the
Holders.

The Indenture Trustee is hereby authorized to
join in the execution of any such supplemental
indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements
and stipulations which may be contained therein and to
accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage
or pledge of any property thereunder, but the
Indenture Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into
any such supplemental indenture which adversely

immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

SECTION 13.02. Supplemental Indentures With
Consent of Holders. With the consent (evidenced as
provided in Article X) of the Majority in Interest of
Certificate Holders, the Owner Trustee (when
authorized by the Owner Participant) and the Indenture
Trustee may, from time to time and at any time, enter
into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto
for the purpose of adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental
indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of
the Holders; provided, however, that, without the
consent of each Holder, no such amendment of or
supplement to this Indenture or any indenture
supplemental hereto, or modification of the terms of,
or consent under, any thereof, shall (a) modify any of
the provisions of Section 7.11 hereof or this Section
13.02, (b) reduce the amount or extend the time of
payment of any amount owing or payable under any
Certificate or reduce the interest payable on any
Certificate (except that only the consent of the
Holder of a Certificate shall be required for any

time of payment of any amount payable under such
Certificate), or alter or modify the provisions of

modify the circumstances under which a Make-Whole

the Collateral Agreement), or deprive any Holder of
the benefit of the Lien of this Indenture or the
Collateral Agreement on the Trust Indenture Estate,
except as provided in Section 7.02 hereof or in
connection with the exercise of remedies under
Article VII. This Section 13.02 shall not apply to
any indenture or indentures supplemental hereto
permitted by, and complying with the terms of, Section
13.06 hereof.

Upon the request of the Owner Trustee (at the
direction of the Owner Participant) and upon the
filing with the Indenture Trustee of evidence of the
consent of Holders and other documents, if any,
required by Section 10.01, the Indenture Trustee shall
join with the Owner Trustee and the Lessee in the
execution of such supplemental indenture unless such
supplemental indenture affects the Indenture Trustee's
own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture
or otherwise, in which case the Indenture Trustee may
in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
enter into such supplemental indenture.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of
the Holders under this Section to approve the
particular form of any proposed supplemental
indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent
shall approve the substance thereof.

Promptly after the execution by the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee of any
supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of
this Section, the Indenture Trustee shall mail a
notice thereof by first-class mail to the Holders at
their addresses as they shall appear on the registry
books of the Registrar, setting forth in general terms
the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any
failure of the Indenture Trustee to mail such notice,
or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way
impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental
indenture.

SECTION 13.03. Effect of Supplemental
Indenture. Upon the execution of any supplemental
indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this
Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and
amended in accordance therewith and the respective
rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities under this Indenture of the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Lessee and the Holders
shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced
hereunder subject in all respects to such
modifications and amendments, and all the terms and
conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be
and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions
of this Indenture for any and all purposes.

SECTION 13.04. Documents to Be Given to
Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee, subject to
the provisions of Sections 9.02 and 9.03, may receive
an officer's certificate and an opinion of counsel as
conclusive evidence that any such supplemental
indenture complies with the applicable provisions of
this Indenture.

SECTION 13.05. Notation on Certificates in
Respect of Supplemental Indentures. Certificates
authenticated and delivered after the execution of any
supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of
this Article may bear a notation in form approved by
the Indenture Trustee as to any matter provided for by
such supplemental indenture. If the Owner Trustee or
the Indenture Trustee shall so determine, new
Certificates so modified as to conform, in the opinion
of the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, to any
modification of this Indenture contained in any such
supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Owner
Trustee, authenticated by the Indenture Trustee and
delivered in exchange for the Outstanding
Certificates.

SECTION 13.06. No Request Necessary for
Lease Supplement or Indenture and Security Agreement
Supplement. Notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 13.02 hereof, no written request or consent of
the Indenture Trustee, any Holder or the Owner
Participant pursuant to Section 13.02 hereof shall be
required to enable the Owner Trustee to enter into any
supplement to the Lease with the Lessee pursuant to
the terms of the Lease to subject a Replacement Engine
thereto or to execute and deliver an Indenture and
Security Agreement Supplement pursuant to the terms
hereof.

Government obligations maturing as to principal and
interest in such amounts and at such times as will
insure the availability of cash sufficient to pay at
maturity all such Certificates not theretofore
delivered to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation,
including principal and interest and Make-Whole
Premium (if any) due or to become due to such date of
maturity as the case may be, and if, in any such case,

Section 6.02(a)(ii) hereof, (B) substitution of
mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen

legal title to any part of the Trust Indenture Estate.
No transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, of any
Certificate or other right, title and interest of any

entitle such Holder or any successor or transferee of
such Holder to an accounting or to the transfer to it
of legal title to any part of the Trust Indenture
Estate.

SECTION 15.03. Sale of Trust Indenture
Estate by Indenture Trustee is Binding. Any sale or
other conveyance of all or any part of the Trust
Indenture Estate by the Indenture Trustee made
pursuant to the terms of this Indenture or of the
Lease shall bind the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the
Holders and the Owner Participant and shall be
effective to transfer or convey all right, title and
interest of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee,
the Owner Participant and such Holders therein and
thereto. No purchaser or other grantee shall be
required to inquire as to the authorization,
necessity, expediency or regularity of such sale or
conveyance or as to the application of any sale or
other proceeds with respect thereto by the Indenture
Trustee.

SECTION 15.04. Indenture for Benefit of
Owner Trustee, Indenture Trustee, Owner Participant
and Holders. Nothing in this Indenture, whether
express or implied, shall be construed to give to any
person other than First Security, the Owner Trustee,

its individual capacity, the Owner Participant, and
the Holders any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or in respect of this Indenture.

SECTION 15.05. No Action Contrary to the
Lessee's Rights Under the Lease. Notwithstanding any
of the provisions of this Indenture or the Trust
Agreement to the contrary, after the Commencement Date
and so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, neither the Indenture Trustee nor
the Owner Trustee will take any affirmative acts that
interfere with the peaceful and quiet possession and
enjoyment of the Aircraft by the Lessee.

SECTION 15.06. Notices. Unless otherwise
expressly specified or permitted by the terms hereof,
all notices, requests, demands, authorizations,
directions, consents, waivers or documents provided or
permitted by this Indenture to be made, given,
furnished or filed shall be in writing, mailed by
certified mail, postage prepaid, or by confirmed telex
or telecopy, and (a) if to the Owner Trustee,
addressed to it at its office at 79 South Main Street,

(unless otherwise expressly provided herein) if in
writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
each Holder entitled thereto, at his last address as
it appears in the Register. In any case where notice
to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to
mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so
mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the
sufficiency of such notice with respect to other
Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in
any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by
the person entitled to receive such notice, either
before or after the event, and such waiver shall be
the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by
Holders shall be filed with the Indenture Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the
validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver.

In case, by reason of the suspension of or
irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be
impracticable to mail notice to the Owner Trustee and
Holders when such notice is required to be given
pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any
manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory
to the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to be a
sufficient giving of such notice.

SECTION 15.07. Officer's Certificates and
Opinions of Counsel; Statements to Be Contained
Therein. Upon any application or demand by the Lessee
or the Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee to take
any action under any of the provisions of this

of such counsel all such conditions precedent, if any,

by any provision of this Indenture relating to such
particular application or demand, no additional
certificate or opinion need be furnished.

representations with respect to the matters upon which
his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as
aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know that the same are
erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of
counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual
matters information with respect to which is in the
possession of the Lessee or First Security, upon the
certificate, statement or opinion of or
representations by an officer or officers of the
Lessee or First Security, as the case may be, unless
such counsel knows that the certificate, statement or
opinion or representations with respect to the matters
upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may
be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the
exercise of reasonable care should know that the same
are erroneous.

Any certificate, statement or opinion of an
officer of the Lessee or First Security or of counsel
thereto may be based, insofar as it relates to
accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of
or representations by an accountant or firm of

firm of public accountants filed with the Indenture
Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is
independent.

SECTION 15.08. Severability. Any provision
of this Indenture which is prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction.

Continuing Waivers. No terms or provisions of this
Indenture or the Certificates may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated orally, but only by an

discharge or termination is sought; and any waiver of
the terms hereof or of any Certificate shall be

specific purpose given.

subject to certain restrictions specified in the
Indenture, except that the right of the Holder of this
Certificate to receive payment of the principal of and
interest and Make-Whole Premium, if any, on this
Certificate on or after the respective due dates, or
to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment, shall not be impaired or affected without the
consent of such Holder.

The Certificates are issuable only as
registered Certificates without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples
thereof. So long as any of the Certificates remain

office or agency where the Certificates may be

amount will be issued to the designated transferee or

of Certificates of the same Maturity and interest rate
and of authorized denominations, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same, upon presentation
thereof for such purpose at the principal corporate

Code;

Aircraft;

(n) the Lessee is not in default under any
mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, lease or other
instrument or agreement to which the Lessee is a party
or by which it or any of its properties or assets may

default or violation would have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, business or
operations of the Lessee or its ability to perform any
of its obligations under the Operative Agreements to
which it is or is to be a party;

Exchange Date only, no Default or Event of Default or

in the Owner Trustee's name pursuant to the Act, (B)
the filing for recordation pursuant to the Act of the
Trust Agreement and Trust Agreement Supplement
covering the Aircraft, and the Lease and Lease
Supplement covering the Aircraft and (C) the filing of
the financing statements referred to in
Section 4.02(d) hereof, no further action, including
any filing or recording of any document, is necessary
or advisable in order to establish the Owner Trustee's
title to and interest in the Aircraft and the Lessor's
Estate as against the Lessee and any third parties;
and (ii) in the case of the Exchange Date only, except
for (A) the actions specified in clauses (i)(A) (B)

possession by the Indenture Trustee of the original
counterpart of the Lease and maintaining possession of
the original counterpart of the Lease Supplement

including any filing or recording of any document, is
necessary or advisable in order to establish the Owner
Trustee's title to and interest in the Aircraft and
the Lessor's Estate as against the Lessee and any
third parties, or to perfect the first security
interest in and Lien on the Trust Indenture Estate (as
it exists on the Commencement Date) in favor of the
Indenture Trustee; and

(s) in the case of the Commencement Date and
the Exchange Date only, all premiums with respect to

Section 6.02. Certain Covenants of Lessee.
The Lessee covenants and agrees with the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee (in its individual
capacity and as Owner Trustee), the Pass Through
Trustee (in its individual capacity and as Pass
Through Trustee) and the Indenture Trustee (in its
individual capacity and as Indenture Trustee) as
follows:

(a) The Lessee will cause to be done,
executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further
acts, conveyances and assurances as the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Participant shall
reasonably require for accomplishing the purposes of
this Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement, the Lease
and the other Operative Agreements to which it is or
is to be a party. Without limiting the generality of
this Section 6.02(a), on and after the Commencement
Date the Lessee will take, or cause to be taken, at
the Lessee's cost and expense, such action with
respect to the recording, filing, re-recording and re-
filing of the Indenture, each Indenture and Security
Agreement Supplement, the Lease, each Lease
Supplement, the Trust Agreement and any financing
statements or other instruments as are necessary, or
as requested by the Indenture Trustee and appropriate,
to maintain the perfection of the first security
interest and the Lien created by the Indenture, and
the Owner Trustee's title to and interest in the
Aircraft and the Lessor's Estate as against the Lessee
and any third parties, or will furnish to the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee timely notice
of the necessity of such action, together with such
instruments, in execution form, and such other
information as may be required to enable it to take
such action at the Lessee's cost and expense in a
timely manner.

(b) After the Commencement Date, the Lessee
shall maintain the certificates with respect to the
Aircraft referred to in Section 7.01 of the Lease and,
on the Commencement Date, shall cause the Aircraft to
be duly registered, and at all times to remain duly
registered, in the name of the Owner Trustee, under
the Act, and shall furnish to the Owner Trustee such
information as may be required to enable the Owner
Trustee to make application for such registration;
provided, however, that the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee agree that if,
in connection with a permitted sublease to a carrier
domiciled outside the United States, upon 30 days'
prior written notice, the Lessee has requested their
consent to the registration of the Aircraft, in the
name of the Owner Trustee (or, if appropriate, in the
name of the Lessee or a sublessee as a "lessee" or a
"sublessee"), at the Lessee's expense, in a country
listed in Schedule III hereto with which the United
States then maintains normal and full diplomatic
relations, the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee, upon receipt by the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of the
assurances and opinion described below, shall not
unreasonably withhold their consent to such change in
registration (it being agreed, without limitation,
that the inability of the Lessee to deliver such
assurances or such opinion shall constitute reasonable
grounds to withhold such consent).

As a condition to any change in the
registration of the Aircraft, the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, and the
Indenture Trustee shall have received:

(i) assurances satisfactory to them:

(A) to the effect that the insurance
provisions of the Lease have been and will be
complied with upon such change of registry;

(B) that the Lessee shall have effected
or caused to be effected at the Lessee's own
cost and expense all recordings and filings
that are required to perfect the Lien of the
Indenture; and as to the continuation of the
corresponding Lien of the Indenture as a
first priority, duly perfected lien on the
Aircraft;

(C) that the Owner Trustee's right,
title and interest in and to the Aircraft is
recognized and fully enforceable in the new
jurisdiction of registry, that the rights of
the Owner Trustee in and to the Aircraft will
not be impaired in such new jurisdiction of
registry and that the new jurisdiction of
registry will give effect to the title and
registry of the Aircraft therein
substantially to the same extent as does the
Government;

(D) that such new country of registry
(x) would provide substantially equivalent
protection for the rights of owner
participants, lessors or lenders in similar
transactions as provided under United States
law (except that, in the absence of
restrictions under the laws of such country
on rights and remedies of lessors and secured
parties similar to those imposed by Sections
362 and 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, rights
and remedies similar to those available under
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code shall not
be required), and (y) imposes aircraft
maintenance standards not materially less
stringent than those of the Aeronautics
Authority;

(E) that import and export
certificates, if required, shall have been
procured at the Lessee's own cost and expense
by the Lessee;

(F) to the effect that the original
indemnities (and any additional indemnities
for which the Lessee is then willing to enter
into a binding agreement to indemnify) in
favor of the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee (in its individual capacity and as
trustee under the Trust Agreement), the
Indenture Trustee (in its individual
capacity, and as trustee under the
Indenture), the other Indemnitees under this
Agreement, the Indenture and the Tax
Indemnity Agreement (in the case of the Owner
Participant only), and the Pass Through
Trustee (in its individual capacity and as
Trustee under the Pass Through Agreement),
afford each such party substantially the same
protection as provided prior to such change
of registry;

(G) that such change will not result in
the imposition of, or increase in the amount
of, any tax for which the Lessee is not
required to indemnify the Owner Participant,
the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee (or
any successor, assign or affiliate thereof)
or the Trust Indenture Estate pursuant to
Article 8 hereof;

(H) that any value added tax, customs
duty, tariff or similar governmental charge
relating to the change in jurisdiction of
registration of the Aircraft shall have been
paid in full or adequately provided for by
the Lessee to the satisfaction of the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant; and

(I) of the payment by the Lessee of any
reasonable expenses of the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and
the Pass Through Trustee in connection with
such change of registry.

(ii) a favorable opinion of counsel
(reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant)
in the new jurisdiction of registry, addressed
and reasonably satisfactory to such parties in
form and substance, to the effect:

(A) that the terms (including, without
limitation, the governing law,
service-of-process and jurisdictional-
submission provisions thereof) of the Lease
and the Indenture are legal, valid, binding
and enforceable in such jurisdiction against
the Lessee, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee, respectively;

(B) that it is not necessary for the
Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee
to register or qualify to do business in such
jurisdiction in connection with the
registration in the new jurisdiction (and the
filing and/or recordation therein of the
Indenture or Lease) and the exercise of any
rights or remedies with respect to the
Aircraft pursuant to the Lease or the
Indenture;

(C) that the courts of such
jurisdiction would provide substantially
equivalent protection to the Lessor, the
Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee
as provided under United States law (with the
exception described in paragraph (b)(i)(D) of
this Section 6.02) in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including,
without limitation, the remedies provided in
the Indenture and the Lease;

(D) that there is no tort liability of
the beneficial owner, record owner, lessor or
mortgagee of an aircraft not in possession
thereof under the laws of such jurisdiction,
other than tort liability which might have
been imposed on such owner, lessor or
mortgagee under the laws of the United States
or any state thereof (it being understood
that, in the event such latter opinion cannot
be given in a form satisfactory to the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee, such
opinion shall be waived, if insurance
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Participant, the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity, is
provided, at Lessee's expense, to cover such
risk and the Lessee undertakes to keep such
insurance in full force and effect); and

(E) (unless the Lessee shall have
agreed to provide insurance reasonably
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Participant covering the risk of
requisition of use of the Aircraft by the
government of registry of the Aircraft) that
the laws of such jurisdiction require fair
compensation by the government of such
jurisdiction payable in currency freely
convertible into United States Dollars for
the loss of use of the Aircraft in the event
of such requisition.

(c) From and after the Commencement Date,
the Lessee shall promptly file any reports, or furnish
to the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant such
information as may be required to enable the Owner
Trustee and the Owner Participant timely to file any
reports required to be filed with respect to the
Aircraft by the Owner Trustee as the Lessor and the
Owner Participant under the Lease with any

with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording
and re-filing of the Lease, the Indenture, the Trust
Agreement, and any supplements to any of them and any
financing statements, continuation statements or other
instruments, and all other action has been taken, as
is necessary to maintain the perfection of the
security interests with respect to the Aircraft
created by said documents and reciting the details of
such action, or (2) that in the opinion of such
counsel no such action is necessary to maintain the
perfection of such security interests; (ii) specifying
all other action which needs to be taken during the
succeeding 14 months in order to maintain the
perfection of such security interests; and (iii)
stating that the Owner Trustee is the owner of legal
title to the Aircraft, and the Aircraft is free and
clear of all Liens, except the security interest
created by the Indenture and such as are permitted by
the Lease and the Indenture.

(f) The Lessee shall at all times maintain
its corporate existence except as permitted by Section
6.02(g) hereof and all of its rights, privileges and
franchises necessary in the normal conduct of its
business, except for any corporate right, privilege or
franchise (i) that it determines, in its reasonable,
good faith business judgment, is no longer necessary
or desirable in the conduct of its business and (ii)
the loss of which will not materially adversely affect
or diminish the rights of the Holders.

(g) The Lessee shall not enter into any
merger or consolidation, or convey, transfer or lease
all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety
to any Person, unless the surviving corporation or
Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease
all or substantially all of the assets of the Lessee
as an entirety (i) is a domestic corporation organized
and existing under the laws of the United States or a
political subdivision thereof, (ii) is a Citizen of
the United States, (iii) is a certificated Air
Carrier, (iv) expressly assumes by an instrument in
writing in form and substance satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee all of the

such instrument to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Participant and the Owner Trustee, (v) provides an
opinion from counsel to the Lessee which counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant
and the Indenture Trustee and which opinion shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant and
the Indenture Trustee and an officer's certificate,
each stating that such merger, consolidation,
conveyance, transfer or lease and the instrument noted
in clause (iv) above comply with this Section 6.02(g),
that such instrument is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of, and is enforceable against, such
survivor or Person, and that all conditions precedent
herein provided for relating to such transaction have
been complied with, and (vi) immediately after such
merger, consolidation or conveyance, transfer or
lease, as the case may be, the surviving company is in
compliance with all of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Lease and each other Operative
Agreement and each other document contemplated hereby
or thereby; provided that no such merger,
consolidation or conveyance, transfer or lease shall
be permitted if the same gives rise to an Event of
Default.

Upon any consolidation or merger, or any
conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Lessee and the satisfaction
of the conditions specified in this Section 6.02(g),
the successor corporation formed by such consolidation
or into which the Lessee is merged or the Person to
which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall
succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise
every right and power of, the Lessee under this
Agreement and the Lease and each other Operative
Agreement and any other document contemplated hereby
and thereby to which the Lessee is a party with the
same effect as if such successor corporation had been
named as the Lessee herein and therein. No such
conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Lessee as an entirety shall
have the effect of releasing the Lessee or any
successor corporation which shall theretofore have
become such in the manner prescribed in this Section
6.02(g) from its liability hereunder or under the
other Operative Agreements. Nothing contained herein
shall permit any lease, sublease, or other arrangement
for the use, operation or possession of the Aircraft
except in compliance with the applicable provisions of
the Lease.

notice to the Owner Participant and the Indenture

of any change in its corporate name.

(i) The Lessee agrees to furnish to the
Owner Participant, the Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee:

cash flows of the Lessee for the fiscal year
then ended as prepared and certified by the
Lessee's independent certified public
accountants, including their opinion;

(B) within sixty (60) days after the
end of the first, second and third quarterly
accounting periods in each fiscal year of the
Lessee, a consolidated balance sheet of the

thereto; and

(F) from time to time, such other
financial information as the Lessor, the

may reasonably request.

Participant and the Indenture Trustee a certificate of
the Lessee, signed by any one of the President, the

reporting to same, is familiar with the relevant terms
of this Agreement and the Lease and the signer has
reviewed, or has caused to be made under such Person's
supervision a review, of the activities of the Lessee
and that, to the best of his or her knowledge, there
does not exist an Event of Default or if an Event of
Default exists or did exist, specifying the nature
thereof, the period of existence thereof and what
action the Lessee has taken or proposes to take with
respect thereto.

Section 6.03. Survival of Representations
and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
the Lessee provided in Sections 6.01 and 6.02 hereof
and in any other Operative Agreement shall survive the
lease of the Aircraft and the expiration or other
termination of this Agreement and the other Operative
Agreements.

ARTICLE 7

OTHER PARTIES' REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
COVENANTS

Section 7.01. Acquisitions and Offerings of
Interests in Lessor's Estate. (a) Owner Participant.
The Owner Participant represents and warrants that its
interest in the Lessor's Estate and the Trust
Agreement was acquired by it for its own account and
not with a view to sale or distribution thereof;
provided, however, that the disposition by the Owner
Participant of its interest in the Lessor's Estate and
the Trust Agreement shall, subject to the terms and
provisions of Section 7.03(d) hereof, at all times be
within its control and the foregoing representation
shall not limit the Owner Participant's right to
transfer or sell such interests pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement. The Owner Participant represents
and warrants that neither it nor anyone authorized to
act on its behalf (including, without limitation,
Lufthansa) has directly or indirectly offered any
interest in the Lessor's Estate or the Trust
Agreement, or in any similar security, for sale to, or
solicited any offer to acquire any of the same from,
anyone. The Owner Participant covenants that neither
it nor anyone authorized to act on its behalf
(including, without limitation, Lufthansa) will make
any offer, solicitation or sale of any interest in the
Lessor's Estate or the Trust Agreement in violation of
the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

(b) Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee
represents and warrants and covenants, both in its
individual capacity and as trustee, that neither it
nor anyone acting on its behalf (i) has directly or
indirectly offered or will directly or indirectly
offer any interest in the Lessor's Estate, or in any
similar security, for sale to, or solicited any offer
to acquire any of the same from anyone (other than the
Owner Participant) and (ii) shall own any
Certificates.

Section 7.02. Citizenship. (a) Generally.
On the Closing Date and on the Commencement Date, the
Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity and as Owner
Trustee, represents and warrants that it is a Citizen
of the United States. If the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity does not comply with the
requirements of this Section 7.02, the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant hereby
agree that a Default or an Event of Default shall not
be deemed to have occurred and be continuing under the
Lease due to non-compliance by the Lessee with the
registration requirements in the Lease occasioned by
the noncompliance of the Owner Trustee.

(b) Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee, in
its individual capacity, covenants that if at any time
it shall have actual knowledge that it has ceased to
be a Citizen of the United States, it will resign
immediately as the Owner Trustee if such citizenship
is necessary under the Act as in effect at such time
or, if it is not necessary under the Act as in effect
at such time, if it is informed in writing by the
Lessee, the Owner Participant or the Indenture Trustee
that such lack of United States citizenship would have
any adverse effect on the Lessee, the Owner
Participant or any Holder. The Owner Trustee, in its
individual capacity, further covenants that if at any
time it appears reasonably probable that it will cease
to be a Citizen of the United States based on
information that is (i) known to a Responsible Officer
or (ii) generally known to the public, it will
promptly so notify, to the extent permitted by law,
all parties to this Agreement.

(c) Owner Participant. The Owner Participant
represents, warrants and covenants that (i) although
it is not a Citizen of the United States, pursuant to
the Trust Agreement it has transferred to the Owner
Trustee, to the extent set forth in the Trust
Agreement, the power to manage and control the
Beneficial Interest of the Aircraft to ensure, as more
fully set forth therein, that such Beneficial Interest
will be controlled by a Citizen of the United States
and that the Owner Participant shall have no power to
influence or limit the exercise of the Owner Trustee's
authority in respect thereof under the Trust
Agreement; (ii) it will fully and faithfully comply
with the provisions of the Trust Agreement as long as
it remains in effect, and in furtherance thereof will
maintain the Trust Agreement in effect with an Owner
Trustee that is a Citizen of the United States;
(iii) if the Owner Participant shall become a Citizen
of the United States, its obligations to maintain
Section 7 of the Trust Agreement shall cease, except
that Section 7 of the Trust Agreement may not be
terminated unless prior thereto the Lessee and, so
long as the Indenture remains in effect, the Indenture
Trustee receives such opinions of counsel (of the same
scope and substance as the opinions of counsel to be
delivered hereunder on the Commencement Date of the
Aircraft) and such amendments of documents and such
other things as they shall reasonably request in
connection with maintaining the validity, perfection
and priority of the Lien of the Indenture on the
Aircraft and the valid and continued registration of
the Aircraft pursuant to Section 501(b)(1)(A)(i) of
the Act; and (iv) if the Owner Participant fails with
respect to its obligations above or in Section 7 of
the Trust Agreement and, as a result of such failure,
the Aircraft is subject to deregistration under the
Act, the Owner Participant shall promptly at its own
expense comply with any of clauses (x), (y) or (z) of
the next sentence. If the Owner Participant shall, at
any time while the Aircraft is registered in the
United States and after Section 7 of the Trust
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to clause (iii)
of the preceding sentence, cease to be a Citizen of
the United States and the Aircraft shall or would
therefore become ineligible for registration in the
name of the Owner Trustee under the Act and
regulations then applicable thereunder, then the Owner
Participant shall give notice thereof to the Lessee
and the Indenture Trustee and shall (at its own
expense and without any reimbursement or indemni-
fication from the Lessee) within 30 days (x) effect a
voting trust or other similar arrangement, (y)
transfer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Trust Agreement all its rights,
title and interest in and to such Trust Agreement, the
Lessor's Estate and this Agreement, or (z) take any
other alternative action that would prevent any
deregistration, or maintain the United States
registration, of the Aircraft. It is agreed that the
Owner Participant shall be liable to pay promptly on
request (A) to each of the other parties hereto and to
each Holder any damages actually suffered by any such
other party or Holder as the result of the
representations and warranties of the Owner
Participant in Sections 7.02(c)(i) and (ii) proving to
be untrue as of the Closing Date and the Commencement
Date; and (B) to the Lessee, the Pass Through Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee or any Holder for any damages
which may be actually incurred by the Lessee (it being
understood that the Lessee shall be obligated to
mitigate such damages by using other aircraft in which
the Owner Participant does not have an interest, if it
can do so without undue burden on the Lessee's
operations), the Pass Through Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee or any Holder as a result of the Owner
Participant's failure to comply with clauses (x), (y)
and (z) of the preceding sentence within the 30 day
period referred to therein. Each party hereto agrees,
upon the request and at the sole expense of the Owner
Participant, to cooperate with the Owner Participant
in complying with its obligations under the provisions
of the second sentence of this Section 7.02(c).

Operative Agreements to which it is or is to be a
party;

knowledge of the Owner Participant, threatened

under the Indenture and the Certificates (as the
same may be amended in connection with such
assumption) to be performed or observed by the
Owner Trustee and (B) which contains amendments
to the Indenture, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, that

title to and interest in the Aircraft or to
reflect the substitution of the Lessee for the
Owner Trustee under the Operative Agreements or
to continue the perfection of the security
interests in the Aircraft and the other rights,
property and interests included in the Trust

received evidence that as of the effectiveness of
the assignment on the date of such assumption the

received a certificate from the Lessee that no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing as of the effective date of such
assumption; and

Indenture Trustee (w) with respect to the
compliance of the assumption contemplated hereby
with the terms, provisions and conditions hereof,

7.12(b), and (z) with respect to the continued
availability of the benefits of Section 1110 of
the Bankruptcy Code to the Indenture Trustee for

Trustee, not in its individual capacity, but solely as
trustee under the Trust Agreement, shall not incur any
indebtedness for borrowed money except as expressly
contemplated herein or in any other Operative
Agreement (excluding the Tax Indemnity Agreement and
the Modification Agreement) and shall not engage in
any business or other activity other than the
transactions contemplated herein or in any other
Operative Agreement (excluding the Tax Indemnity
Agreement and the Modification Agreement) and all
necessary or appropriate activity related thereto.

Section 7.14. Compliance with Trust
Agreement, Etc. Each of the Owner Participant, First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association and the
Owner Trustee agrees with the Lessee, the Pass Through
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee (i) to comply with
all of the terms of the Trust Agreement (as the same
may hereafter be amended or supplemented from time to
time in accordance with the terms thereof) applicable
to it in its respective capacity, the noncompliance
with which would materially adversely affect any such
party and (ii) not to take any action, or cause any
action to be taken, to amend, modify or supplement any
provision of the Trust Agreement in a manner that
would adversely affect such party without the prior
written consent of such party. The Owner Trustee
confirms for the benefit of the Lessee, the Pass
Through Trustee and the Indenture Trustee that it will
comply with the provisions of Article 2 of the Trust
Agreement. So long as the Lease remains in effect,
the Owner Participant agrees not to terminate or
revoke the trusts created by the Trust Agreement
without the consent of the Lessee (except in
connection with the exercise of remedies pursuant to
Section 17 of the Lease) or the Indenture Trustee.
The Owner Participant further agrees not to remove the
institution acting as Owner Trustee, and not to
replace the institution acting as Owner Trustee in the
event that such institution resigns as Owner Trustee,
without in either case having obtained the prior
written consent of the Lessee (except in connection
with the exercise of remedies pursuant to Section 17
of the Lease) and (so long as the Indenture shall not
have been discharged) the Indenture Trustee. The
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant agree that no
co-trustee or separate trustee shall be appointed
pursuant to Section 3.14 of the Trust Agreement
without the Lessee's and the Indenture Trustee's prior
written consent; provided that the Lessee's consent
shall not be required if an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing.

(other than a sale at fair market value at the
end of any Renewal Term) or Sections 7, 8, 9, 10,
or 11 or Sections 12.01, 12.02 and 12.03 of the

there not been a succession, assignment or other
transfer by such original Indemnitee of any such
interest of such Indemnitee in the Aircraft or
any part thereof, any interest in or under any
Operative Agreement, or any proceeds thereunder

in the United States) and; provided, however,

of forms or documents) and as to which
arrangements have been made to the Lessee's
reasonable satisfaction such that the Lessee

or on any person who is a "disqualified person",
within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(2) of the

meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, by virtue of
such person's relationship to the Owner
Participant as the result of any prohibited
transaction, within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code,
occurring with respect to the purchase or holding
of any Certificate (i) over which purchase or
holding the Owner Participant (or any Affiliate
thereof, which for purposes of this clause (xi)
shall also include any affiliate within the
meaning of the first sentence of Part V(c)(3) of
Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-14) has
discretion or control, or (ii) by an employee
benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA, or an individual retirement account or
plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code with
respect to which the Owner Participant (or any
Affiliate thereof) has the power, directly or
indirectly, to appoint or terminate, or to
negotiate the terms of the management agreement
with the person or persons having discretion or
control over such purchase or holding provided,
however, that such exclusion shall occur only in
the event that the Owner Participant or any
Affiliate thereof which has the discretion or
control described in subclause (i) above or which
has the power described in subclause (ii) above,
as the case may be, knows or reasonably should
have known that such purchase, or holding of the
Certificates may constitute a prohibited
transaction, within the meaning of Section
4975(c)(1) of the Code. For purposes of this
clause (xi) the words "reasonably should have
known" shall mean that the Owner Participant or
any Affiliate thereof shall take such steps as a
reasonable prudent person would take acting in a
like capacity to determine if such purchase, or
holding of the Certificates, may constitute a
prohibited transaction within the meaning of
Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code;

(xii) Taxes arising out of or otherwise
attributable to the formation of the trust
described in the Trust Agreement, or the
contribution or transfer of the Aircraft or other
property to such trust;

(xiii) any U.S. federal withholding taxes
imposed on Rent payable to any Indemnitee which
is a Non-U.S. Person;

(xiv) any Taxes arising out of or in
connection with a Demand Note, the Letter of
Credit or the Collateral Agreement; and

(xv) any Taxes payable by the Owner
Participant or Owner Trustee (as contemplated by
Section 4.01(m) hereof or by Lufthansa pursuant
to the Sales Agreement.

(c) Withholding. The Pass Through Trustee
shall withhold any Taxes required to be withheld on
payments to any holder of a Pass Through Certificate
except to the extent that such holder has furnished
evidence to the Pass Through Trustee sufficient under
applicable law to entitle such holder to any exemption
from or reduction in the rate of withholding claimed
by such holder. The Indenture Trustee shall withhold
any Taxes required to be withheld on any payment to a
Holder pursuant to Section 5.09 of the Indenture. If
the Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee
fails to withhold any U.S. Federal withholding or
backup withholding Tax required to be withheld with
respect to any Holder of a Certificate or Pass Through
Certificate, as the case may be, and a claim is asserted
by a taxing authority against the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant or any Affiliate of either with respect to
such Tax, the Lessee will indemnify the Owner Trustee
and the Owner Participant and any Affiliate of either
thereof (without regard to the exclusion set forth in
Section 8.01(b)(viii) hereof), and the Indenture
Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may
be, in turn in its individual capacity (and without
recourse to the Trust Indenture Estate) agrees to
indemnify the Lessee, against any such Taxes required
to be withheld and any interest and penalties with
respect thereto. If, with respect to any Holder of a
Certificate or a holder of a Pass Through Certificate,
the Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, as the
case may be, fails to withhold any amount required to be
withheld pursuant to Section 5.09 of the Indenture or
hereunder, the Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through
Trustee shall be entitled to withhold from any future
payments otherwise distributable to such Holder of a
Certificate or holder of a Pass Through Certificate,
as the case may be, until such amounts shall have been
recovered in full by the Indenture Trustee or the Pass
Through Trustee, in their respective individual capacities,
to the extent of any indemnity payments made, as the case
may be.

Section 8.02. After-Tax Basis. The amount
which the Lessee shall be required to pay with respect
to any Tax indemnified against under Section 8.01
shall be an amount sufficient to restore the
Indemnitee, on an After-Tax Basis, to the same
position such party would have been in had such Tax
not been incurred. If any Indemnitee actually
realizes a permanent tax benefit by reason of the
payment of any Tax paid or indemnified against by the
Lessee, such Indemnitee shall within 30 days of filing
a tax return which reflects such permanent tax benefit
pay to the Lessee to the extent such tax benefit was
not previously taken into account in computing such
payment, but not before the Lessee shall have made all
payments then due to such Indemnitee from the Lessee
under this Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement and
any other Operative Agreement, an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) the sum of such permanent tax benefit
plus any other tax benefit actually realized by such
Indemnitee that would not have been realized but for
any payment made by such Indemnitee pursuant to this
sentence and not already paid to the Lessee (with the
amount of such benefit to be determined by assuming
full utilization of such benefit); and (y) the amount
of all prior payments made under Sections 8.01 and
8.02 by the Lessee to such Indemnitee less the amounts
of all prior payments made by such Indemnitee to the
Lessee pursuant to this Section 8.02 (and the excess,
if any, of the amount described in clause (x) above
over the amount described in clause (y) above shall be
carried forward and applied to reduce pro tanto any
subsequent obligations of the Lessee to make payments
pursuant to Section 8.01); provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing portions of this
sentence, such Indemnitee shall not be obligated to
make any payment to the Lessee pursuant to this
sentence as long as an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing under the Lease. The
Lessee shall reimburse on an After-Tax Basis such
Indemnitee for any payment of a tax benefit pursuant
to the preceding sentence (or a tax benefit otherwise
taken into account in calculating the Lessee's
indemnity obligation hereunder) to the extent that
such tax benefit is disallowed or reduced in a taxable
year subsequent to the year of such payment (including
the expiration of any tax credit carryovers or
carrybacks of such Indemnitee that would not otherwise
have expired).

Section 8.03. Time of Payment. Any amount
payable to an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article 8
shall be paid within 30 days after receipt of a
written demand therefor from such Indemnitee
accompanied by a written statement describing in
reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the
computation of the amount so payable, provided that in
the case of amounts which are being contested by the
Lessee in good faith or by the Indemnitee in either
case pursuant to Section 8.04, such amount shall be
payable 30 days after the time such contest is finally
resolved.

Section 8.04. Contests. If a written claim
is made against any Indemnitee for Taxes with respect
to which the Lessee is liable for a payment or
indemnity hereunder, such Indemnitee shall promptly
give the Lessee notice in writing of such claim and
shall furnish the Lessee with copies of any requests
for information from any taxing authority relating to
such Taxes with respect to which the Lessee may be
required to indemnify hereunder; provided, however,
that the failure of an Indemnitee to give such notice
or furnish such copy shall not terminate any of the
rights of such Indemnitee under this Article 8, except
to the extent that the Lessee's contest rights have
been materially adversely impaired by the failure to
provide such notice. The Indemnitee shall in good
faith, with due diligence and at the Lessee's expense,
if timely requested in writing by the Lessee, contest
(or, at the Indemnitee's option, require the Lessee to
contest in the name of the Lessee, if permitted by
law) the validity, applicability or amount of such
Taxes by:

(i) resisting payment thereof if lawful and
practicable or not paying the same except under
protest if protest is necessary and proper in
each case so long as non-payment will not result
in a material risk of the sale, forfeiture or
loss of, or the creation of a Lien other than a
Lien permitted under Section 6.01 of the Lease on
the Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine or any risk
or criminal liability; or

(ii) if the payment be made, using
reasonable efforts to obtain a refund thereof in
appropriate administrative and judicial
proceedings.

If the Indemnitee, after reasonable discussion with
the Lessee and consideration in good faith of any
suggestion made by the Lessee as to the method of
pursuing such contest, elects to conduct the contest,
such Indemnitee shall determine the manner in which to
contest such Taxes, and shall periodically or upon the
Lessee's request advise the Lessee of the progress of
such contest. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences
of this Section 8.04, such Indemnitee shall not be
required to take or continue any action unless the
Lessee shall have (i) agreed in writing to pay and
shall pay the Indemnitee on demand and on an After-Tax
Basis for any liability or reasonable expense which
such Indemnitee may incur as a result of contesting
such Taxes including without limitation (y) reasonable
attorneys' and accountants' fees and (z) the amount of
any interest, penalty or additions to tax which may
ultimately be payable as the result of contesting such
Taxes, (ii) delivered to the Indemnitee a written
acknowledgment of the Lessee's obligation to such
Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement to the extent
that the contest is not successful and of the
inapplicability of any exclusion or defenses thereto,
provided, however, that such acknowledgment shall not
preclude the Lessee from raising defenses to liability
under this Agreement if a decision in such contest is
rendered which clearly articulates the cause of such
Tax and the cause, as so articulated, is not one for
which the Lessee is responsible to pay an indemnity
hereunder, (iii) made all payments and indemnities
(other than contested payments and indemnities) then
due to the Indemnitee hereunder or with respect to any
of the transactions contemplated by or under the
Operative Agreements. In no event shall such
Indemnitee be required or the Lessee permitted to
contest pursuant to this Section 8.04 the imposition
of any Tax for which the Lessee is obligated to
indemnify any Indemnitee hereunder unless (i) such
Indemnitee shall have received an opinion of
independent tax counsel, at the Lessee's expense,
selected by such Indemnitee and reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessee ("Tax Counsel") to the
effect that a reasonable basis exists for contesting
such claim, (ii) such Indemnitee shall have determined
that such contest will not result in any material risk
of loss, sale or forfeiture of, or the creation of a
Lien (other than Lessor's Liens) on, the Aircraft or
any part thereof or interest thereon or in a risk of
criminal liability, or adversely affect the Trust
Indenture Estate, (iii) if an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee shall have
provided security for its obligations hereunder
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee (iv) if such
contest shall be conducted in a manner requiring
payment of the claim in advance, the Lessee shall have
advanced sufficient funds, on an interest free basis
to make the payment required, and agreed to indemnify
the Indemnitee against any additional net adverse tax
consequences on an After-Tax Basis to such Indemnitee
of such advance and (v) the issue shall not be the
same as an issue previously contested hereunder and
decided adversely, unless the Indemnitee shall have
received, at the Lessee's sole expense, a written
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to such Indemnitee, of Tax Counsel, to the effect that
the applicable law has changed and, in light thereof,
there is substantial authority within the meaning of
Section 6662 of the Code, as interpreted by the
Treasury regulations thereunder, or under similar
principles of state or foreign law (as the case may
be) for contesting such claim and (vi) the amount of
such adjustment, when aggregated with related and
correlative adjustments, is at least $25,000.

The Indemnitee shall not be required to
appeal any judicial decision unless it receives an
opinion of Tax Counsel, at the Lessee's sole expense,
to the effect that it is more likely than not that
such decision will be reversed on appeal.

Nothing contained in this Section 8.04 shall
require any Indemnitee to contest or continue to
contest, or permit the Lessee to contest, a claim
which such Indemnitee would otherwise be required to
contest pursuant to this Section 8.04, if such
Indemnitee shall waive payment by the Lessee of any
amount that might otherwise be payable by the Lessee
under this Article 8 in connection with such claim.

Section 8.05. Refunds. Upon receipt by an
Indemnitee of a refund of all or any part of any Taxes
which the Lessee shall have paid for such Indemnitee
or for which the Lessee shall have reimbursed or
indemnified such Indemnitee, and provided there shall
not have occurred and be continuing any Event of
Default by the Lessee hereunder or under the Lease (in
which case payment shall not be made to the Lessee
until such Event of Default shall have been cured),
such Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee an amount
equal to the amount of such refund less (x) reasonable
expenses not previously reimbursed, (y) all payments
then due to such Indemnitee under this Article 8 and
(z) Taxes imposed with respect to the accrual or
receipt thereof, including interest received
attributable thereto, plus any net tax benefit
actually realized by such Indemnitee as a result of
any payment by such Indemnitee made pursuant to this
sentence; provided, however, that such amount shall
not be payable (a) before such time as the Lessee
shall have made all payments or indemnities then due
and payable to such Indemnitee under this Article 8 or
(b) to the extent that the amount of such payment
would exceed (i) the amount of all prior payments by
the Lessee to such Indemnitee pursuant to this Article
8 less (ii) the amount of all prior payments by such
Indemnitee to the Lessee pursuant to this Article 8.

Any subsequent loss of such refund or tax
benefit shall be treated as a Tax subject to
indemnification under the provisions of this Article
8.

Section 8.06. Lessee's Reports. With
respect to the Aircraft, in case any report or return
is required to be made with respect to any obligation
of the Lessee under this Article 8, the Lessee shall
make such report or return, except for any such report
or return that the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant has notified the Lessee that it intends to
file, in such manner as will show the ownership of the
Aircraft in the Owner Trustee and shall send a copy of
the applicable portions of such report or return to
the Indemnitee and the Owner Trustee or will notify
the Indemnitee of such requirement and make such
report or return in such manner as shall be
satisfactory to such Indemnitee and the Owner Trustee.
The Lessee will provide such information reasonably
available to the Lessee as the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant may reasonably request from the
Lessee to enable the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant to fulfill its tax filing requirements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Agreements (without duplication of the
requirements of Section 3 of Tax Indemnity Agreement)
and any audit information request arising from any
such filing. The Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant will provide such information as the
Lessee may reasonably request from the Owner
Participant to enable the Lessee to fulfill its tax
filing requirements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements and any audit
information request arising from such filing. The
Lessee shall hold the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant harmless on an After-Tax Basis from and
against any net after tax cost for liabilities,
including penalties, additions to tax, fines and
interest, imposed upon the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant to the extent directly attributable to any
insufficiency or inaccuracy in any return, statement,
or report prepared by the Lessee or information
supplied by the Lessee, or directly attributable to
the Lessee's failure to supply reasonably available
information to the Owner Trustee or Owner Participant
as required by this Section 8.06.

Section 8.07. Survival of Obligations. The
representations, warranties, indemnities and
agreements of the Lessee provided for in this Article
8 and the Lessee's obligations under any and all of
them shall survive the expiration or other termination
of the Operative Agreements.

Section 8.08. Payment of Taxes. With
respect to any Tax otherwise indemnifiable hereunder
by the Lessee and applicable to the Aircraft,
Airframe, any Engine or Parts, to the extent permitted
by the applicable state, local or foreign law, the
Lessee shall pay such tax directly to the relevant
taxing authority and file any returns or reports
required with respect thereto; provided, however, that
the Lessee shall not make any statements or take any
action which would indicate that the Lessee or any
Person other than the Owner Trust or Owner Participant
is the owner of the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine
or any Part or would otherwise be inconsistent with
the terms of the Lease and the position thereunder of
the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant. Copies
of such returns or reports, together with evidence of
payment of any Tax due, shall be sent by the Lessee to
the Owner Participant within thirty (30) days after
the date of each payment by the Lessee of any Tax.

Section 8.09. Reimbursements by Indemnitees
Generally. If, for any reason, the Lessee is required
to make any payment with respect to any Taxes imposed
on any Indemnitee in respect of the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements or on the
Aircraft, the Airframe, the Engines, the Parts or any
part thereof, which Taxes are not the responsibility
of the Lessee under Section 8.01 hereof, then such
Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee an amount which
equals the amount paid by the Lessee with respect to
such Taxes.

ARTICLE 9

GENERAL INDEMNITY

Section 9.01. Generally. (a) The Lessee
agrees to indemnify each Indemnitee against and agrees
to protect, defend, save and keep harmless each
Indemnitee from any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages (including if, as a result of an
Indenture Default described in Section 7.01(a)(i) of
the Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall have sold
all or any portion of the Indenture Estate and the
proceeds thereof were less than an amount equal to
accrued and unpaid Basic Rent on the date of sale plus
the Stipulated Loss Value as of such date, damages
equal to such shortfall together with interest thereon
to the extent permitted by law at the Debt Rate until
such shortfall is paid in full), penalties, claims,
actions, suits, costs, disbursements and expenses
(including, except as otherwise provided in the
Operative Agreements, reasonable legal fees and
expenses and all other costs and expenses relating to
amendments, supplements, adjustments, waivers and
consents under the Operative Agreements, in each case
requested by the Lessee unless such amendment,
supplement, adjustment or waiver is made during the
continuance of an Event of Default and any amounts
payable under the indemnification provisions of the
Indenture or the Trust Agreement and any amounts
payable under the Indenture in respect of Make-Whole
Premium (to the extent payable under Section 3.02 of
the Lease)) whether or not any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated
(individually, an "Expense," collectively,
"Expenses"), which may be imposed on, incurred or
suffered by or asserted against any Indemnitee, in any
way relating to, based on or arising out of:

(i) this Agreement, the Lease, the
Indenture, the Trust Agreement, or any other
Operative Agreement (including any action or
inaction of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee, in each case in their capacity as
trustees) or any other document entered into in
connection herewith or any sublease or any
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;

(ii) the operation, possession, use,
non-use, maintenance, storage, overhaul,
delivery, non-delivery, control, repair or
testing of the Aircraft, Airframe, or any Engine
or any engine used in connection with the
Airframe, or any part thereof by the Lessee any
sublessee or any other Person whatsoever, whether
or not such operation, possession, use, non-use,
maintenance, storage, overhaul, delivery,
non-delivery, control, repair or testing is in
compliance with the terms of the Lease, including
without limitation, claims for death, personal
injury or property damage or other loss or harm
to any Person whatsoever, including, without
limitation, any passengers, shippers or other
Persons wherever located, and claims relating to
any laws, rules or regulations, including,
without limitation, environmental control, noise
and pollution laws, rules or regulation;

(iii) the manufacture, design, return,
acceptance, rejection, condition, repair,
modification, servicing, rebuilding,
airworthiness, registration, reregistration,
performance, non-performance, sublease,
merchantability, fitness for use, alteration,
substitution or replacement of the Aircraft, the
Airframe, any Engine or any Part including,
without limitation, latent and other defects,
whether or not discoverable, strict tort
liability, and any claims for patent, trademark
or copyright infringement;

(iv) any breach of or failure to perform or
observe, or any other non-compliance with, any
condition, covenant or agreement to be performed,
or other obligations of the Lessee under any of
the Operative Agreements, or the falsity or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
the Lessee in any of the Operative Agreements
(other than representations and warranties in the
Tax Indemnity Agreement);

(v) with respect to the Indenture Trustee,
the enforcement of the terms of the Operative
Agreements and the administration of the Trust
Indenture Estate; and

(vi) the offer, issuance, sale or
delivery of any Certificate or any Pass Through
Certificate, or in any way relating to or arising
out of the Indenture or the Trust Indenture
Estate or, with respect to the Indenture Trustee
only, of any interest in the Lessor's Estate or
the Trust Agreement or in any way relating to or
arising out of the Trust Agreement and the
Lessor's Estate and with respect to the Owner
Participant and the Owner Trustee, of any
interest in the Lessor's Estate or the Trust
Agreement or in any way relating to or arising
out of the Trust Agreement or the Lessor's Estate
at a time when an Event of Default is continuing,
during a period following an Event of Loss, or in
connection with the termination of the Lease or
action or direction of the Lessee with respect to
the Aircraft pursuant to Section 4.02 (other than
any sale at fair market value) or Article 10 of
the Lease (including, in each such case set forth
in this clause (vi), without limitation, any
claim arising out of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or any other federal or state
statute, law or regulation, or at common law or
otherwise relating to securities), or the action
or inaction of the Owner Trustee, the Pass
Through Trustee or Indenture Trustee as trustees,
in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the
Indenture, the Indenture and Security Agreement
Supplement, the Trust Agreement, the Trust
Agreement Supplement covering the Aircraft and in
the case of the Owner Participant, its
obligations arising under Section 6.01 of the
Trust Agreement.

The foregoing indemnity by the Lessee is intended to
include and cover, but is not limited to, any Expense
to which the Indemnitees may be subject as a result of
their respective ownership or leasing of any interest
in the Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or Part during
the Term, whether or not in the Lessee's possession or
control, insofar as such Expense relates to any
activity or event whatsoever involving such item while
it is under lease to the Lessee (or after termination
of the Lease in connection with the exercise of
remedies thereunder to the extent that such Expense is
attributable to the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the other Operative Agreement), and such
Expense does not fall within any of the exceptions
listed in Section 9.01(b) hereof.

(b) Exceptions. The indemnity provided for
in Section 9.01(a) shall not extend to any Expense of
any Indemnitee:

(i) which would not have occurred but for
the willful misconduct or gross negligence of
such Indemnitee;

(ii) to the extent attributable to acts or
events which occur prior to the date on which the
Aircraft is leased under the Lease or after the
Aircraft is no longer leased under the Lease or
after the expiration of the Term (other than, in
each such case, pursuant to Article 17 of the
Lease, in which case the indemnity provided in
Section 9.01(a) hereof shall survive for so long
as the Lessor shall be entitled to exercise
remedies under such Article 17), or to acts or
events which occur after return of possession of
the Aircraft by the Lessee in accordance with the
provisions of the Lease but in any such case only
to the extent not fairly attributable to acts or
omissions of the Lessee prior to expiration of
the Term, including without limitation the
Lessee's failure to fully discharge all of its
obligations under the Lease or other Operative
Agreements;

(iii) which is a Tax, whether or not the
Lessee is required to indemnify therefor pursuant
to Article 8 hereof or pursuant to the Tax
Indemnity Agreement other than Taxes necessary to
hold an Indemnitee harmless on an After-Tax Basis
in accordance with Section 9.02 hereof;

(iv) which is a cost, expense or payment
that this Agreement or any other Operative
Agreement expressly requires be paid by the Owner
Participant or the Lessor or any other Person;

(v) which would not have been incurred by
such Indemnitee if such Indemnitee had not been
in breach of its representations or warranties,
or had not defaulted in the observance and
performance of the terms and provisions provided
to be observed and performed by it, in this
Agreement, the Lease, the Indenture, the Trust
Agreement or any other Operative Agreement to
which it is a party unless such breach or default
shall be a result of the breach or default of any
of the foregoing by the Lessee or another
Indemnitee;

(vi) [Intentionally Omitted];

(vii) in the case of the Owner Participant,
Lessor's Liens to the extent attributable to the
Owner Participant; in the case of the Owner
Trustee, Lessor's Liens to the extent
attributable to the Owner Trustee; and in the
case of the Indenture Trustee, Indenture
Trustee's Liens;

(viii) in the case of the Owner Participant or
the Owner Trustee, to the extent attributable to
the offer or sale by such Indemnitee after the
Commencement Date of any interest in the
Aircraft, the Lessor's Estate or the Trust
Agreement or any similar interest (including an
offer or sale resulting from bankruptcy or other
proceedings for the relief of debtors in which
such Indemnitee is the debtor), unless in each
case such offer or sale shall occur (x) during a
period when an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, (y) during a period when an Event
of Loss has occurred or (z) in connection with
the termination of the Lease or action or
direction of the Lessee with respect to the
Aircraft pursuant to Section 4.02 (other than any
sale at fair market value) or Article 10 of the
Lease;

(ix) in the case of the Owner Participant
or any person who is a "disqualified person",
within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(2) of the
Code, or a "party in interest", within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, by virtue of
such person's relationship to the Owner
Participant, resulting from any prohibited
transaction, within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code,
occurring with respect to the purchase or holding
of any Certificate (i) over which purchase or
holding the Owner Participant (or any Affiliate
thereof, which for purposes of this clause (ix)
shall also include any affiliate within the
meaning of the first sentence of Part V(c)(3) of
Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-14) has
discretion or control, or (ii) by an employee
benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA, or an individual retirement account or
plan subject to Section 4975 of the Code with
respect to which the Owner Participant (or any
Affiliate thereof) has the power, directly or
indirectly, to appoint or terminate, or to
negotiate the terms of the management agreement
with the person or persons having discretion or
control over such purchase or holding provided,
however, that such exclusion shall occur only in
the event that the Owner Participant or any
Affiliate thereof which has the discretion or
control described in subclause (i) above or which
has the power described in subclause (ii) above,
as the case may be, knows or reasonably should
have known that such purchase, or holding of the
Certificates may constitute a prohibited
transaction, within the meaning of Section
4975(c)(1) of the Code. For purposes of this
clause (ix) the words "reasonably should have
known" shall mean that the Owner Participant or
any Affiliate thereof shall take such steps as a
reasonably prudent person would take acting in a
like capacity to determine if such purchase, or
holding of the Certificates, may constitute a
prohibited transaction, within the meaning of
Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code;

(x) for (i) costs and expenses incurred in
connection with Lufthansa's efforts to raise
Nonrecourse Financing (as defined in the
Agreement to Lease) in respect of which the
Lessee is not liable under Section 13 of the
Agreement to Lease and (ii) any other liability
in connection with such Nonrecourse Financing for
which the Lessee is not responsible under such
Section 13;

(xi) with respect to the Lessor, any Expense
indemnified by DA under the Modification
Agreement; and

(xii) which is an Expense relating to (1) (A)
the Collateral Agreement, (B) any Demand Note,
(C) the Letter of Credit, (D) to the extent
incurred prior to the Exchange Date,the Indenture
or the Trust Indenture Estate, or (2) any of the
transactions contemplated as occurring prior to
the Exchange Date pursuant to the documents
referred to in this clause (xii).

(xiii) which is an Expense that, pursuant to
the Indemnification Agreement or the Underwriting
Agreement, is to be borne by Lufthansa.

Section 9.02. After-Tax Basis. The amount
which the Lessee shall be required to pay with respect
to any Expense indemnified against under Section 9.01
shall be an amount sufficient to restore the
Indemnitee, on an After-Tax Basis, to the same
position such party would have been in had such
Expense not been incurred. If any Indemnitee actually
realizes a permanent tax benefit by reason of the
payment of such Expense paid or indemnified against by
the Lessee which was not considered in the computation
thereof, such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the
Lessee, but not before the Lessee shall have made all
payments theretofore due such Indemnitee from the
Lessee under this Agreement, the Tax Indemnity
Agreement and any other Operative Agreement, an amount
equal to the lesser of (x) the sum of such permanent
tax benefit plus any other tax benefit actually
realized by such Indemnitee as the result of any
payment made by such Indemnitee pursuant to this
sentence and (y) the amount of such payment pursuant
to this Section 9.02 by the Lessee to such Indemnitee
plus the amount of any other payments by the Lessee to
such Indemnitee theretofore made pursuant to this
Section 9.02 less the amount of any payments by such
Indemnitee to the Lessee theretofore made pursuant to
this Section 9.02 (and the excess, if any, of the
amount described in clause (x) above over the amount
described in clause (y) above shall be carried forward
and applied to reduce pro tanto any subsequent
obligations of the Lessee to make payments pursuant to
this Section 9.02), provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing portions of this
sentence, such Indemnitee shall not be obligated to
make any payment to the Lessee pursuant to this
sentence so long as an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing. Any taxes that are
imposed on any Indemnitee as a result of the
disallowance or reduction of such tax benefit referred
to in the next preceding sentence in a taxable year
subsequent to the year of allowance and utilization by
such Indemnitee (including the expiration of any tax
credit carryovers or carrybacks of such Indemnitee
that would not otherwise have expired) shall be
indemnifiable pursuant to the provisions of Section
8.01 hereof.

Section 9.03. Subrogation. Upon the payment
in full of any indemnity pursuant to this Article 9 by
the Lessee (but not earlier), the Lessee shall be
subrogated to any right of the Indemnitee, other than
with respect to any of such Indemnitee's insurance
policies or in connection with any indemnity claim the
Person indemnified may have against any other
Indemnitee in respect of the matter against which such
indemnity has been made.

Section 9.04. Notice and Payment. Each
Indemnitee and the Lessee shall give prompt written
notice one to the other of any liability of which such
party has knowledge for which the Lessee is, or may
be, liable under this Article 9; provided, however,
that failure to give such notice shall not terminate
any of the rights of Indemnitees under this Article 9,
except to the extent that the Lessee has been
materially prejudiced by the failure to provide such
notice. Unless otherwise provided in the Operative
Agreements, any amount payable to an Indemnitee
pursuant to this Article 9 shall be paid within 30
days after receipt of a written demand therefor from
such Indemnitee accompanied by a written statement
describing in reasonable detail the basis for such
indemnity and the computation of the amount so
payable.

Section 9.05. Refunds. If any Indemnitee
shall obtain a recovery of all or any part of any
amount which the Lessee shall have paid to such
Indemnitee or for which the Lessee shall have
reimbursed such Indemnitee under this Article 9, and
provided there shall not have occurred a Payment
Default or an Event of Default (in which case payment
shall not be made to the Lessee until such Payment
Default or Event of Default shall have been cured)
such Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee the amount of
any such recovery, including interest received with
respect to the recovery, net of any Taxes paid or
payable as a result of the receipt of the recovery and
interest, plus any net additional permanent income tax
benefits actually realized by Indemnitee as the result
of any payment made pursuant to this sentence less any
reasonable costs and expense of any Indemnitee not
reimbursed by the Lessee; provided, however, that such
amount shall not be payable (a) before such time as
the Lessee shall have made all payments or indemnities
then due and payable to such Indemnitee under this
Article 9 or (b) to the extent that the amount of such
payment would exceed the amount of all prior payments
by the Lessee to such Indemnitee pursuant to this
Article 9, less the amount of all prior payments by
such Indemnitee to the Lessee pursuant to this Article
9. Any subsequent loss of such recovery or tax
benefit shall be subject to indemnification under
Article 8 or this Article 9, as the case may be.

Section 9.06. Defense of Claims. The Lessee
or its insurers shall have the right (in each such
case at the Lessee's sole expense) to investigate or,
provided that (i) the Lessee or the Lessee's insurers
shall not reserve the right to dispute liability with
respect to any insurance policies pursuant to which
coverage is sought, (ii) in the case of defense by the
Lessee, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and (iii) the Lessee shall have first
acknowledged in writing to such Indemnitee the
Lessee's liability to such Indemnitee hereunder in
respect of such claim, provided, however, that such
acknowledgment shall not preclude the Lessee from
raising defenses to such liability if the judgement
rendered on termination of the applicable legal
proceedings articulates the cause of such claim and
the cause, as so articulated, is not one for which the
Lessee is responsible to pay an indemnity hereunder
(and either (i) the judgment is one from which no
appeal is allowable or (ii) if such appeal is
allowable, the applicable Indemnitee shall not have
made a timely appeal), defend any claim covered by
insurance for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to this Article 9 and each Indemnitee with respect to
the applicable Aircraft shall cooperate with the
Lessee or its insurers with respect thereto, and
provided, further, the Lessee shall not be entitled to
assume and control the defense of any such claim if
and to the extent such Indemnitee reasonably objects
to such control on the ground that an actual or
potential material conflict of interest exists where
it is advisable for such Indemnitee to be represented
by separate counsel. Subject to the immediately
foregoing sentence, where the Lessee or the insurers
under a policy of insurance maintained by the Lessee
undertake the defense of an Indemnitee with respect to
such a claim, no additional legal fees or expenses of
such Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such
claim shall be indemnified hereunder unless the fees
or expenses were incurred at the written request of
the Lessee or such insurers. Subject to the
requirement of any policy of insurance applicable to a
claim, an Indemnitee may participate at its own
expense at any judicial proceeding controlled by the
Lessee or its insurers pursuant to the preceding
provisions, provided that such party's participation
does not, in the opinion of the independent counsel
appointed by the Lessee or its insurers to conduct
such proceedings, interfere with such control; and
such participation shall not constitute a waiver of
the indemnification provided in this Section 9.06. No
Indemnitee shall enter into any settlement or other
compromise with respect to any claim described in this
Section 9.06 without the prior written consent of the
Lessee, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld or delayed, unless (i) such Indemnitee waives
its right to be indemnified under this Article 9 with
respect to such claim or (ii) the Lessee has not,
within 30 Business Days following receipt of notice by
such Indemnitee, acknowledged in writing its liability
to such Indemnitee hereunder (as provided above) in
respect of such claim.

Section 9.07. Survival of Obligations. The
representations, warranties, indemnities and
agreements of the Lessee provided for in this Article
9 and the Lessee's obligations under any and all of
them shall survive the expiration or other termination
of this Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement, the
Trust Agreement, the Indenture, the Lease and the
other Operative Agreements but, as to such indemni-
ties, only with respect to Expenses caused by events
occurring or existing prior to or incurred in the
process of (i) the return or disposition of the
Aircraft under Article 12 or Article 17 of the Lease,
or (ii) the termination of the Lease or the Indenture
as it relates to the Aircraft or, if later, the return
of the Aircraft.

Section 9.08. Effect of Other Indemnities.
The Lessee's obligations under the indemnities
provided for in this Agreement shall be those of a
primary obligor whether or not the Person indemnified
shall also be indemnified with respect to the same
matter under the terms of this Agreement, the Lease,
the Indenture, the Trust Agreement, or any other
document or instrument, and the Person seeking
indemnification from the Lessee pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement may proceed directly
against the Lessee without first seeking to enforce
any other right of indemnification.

Section 9.09. Interest. The Lessee will pay
to each Indemnitee on demand, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, interest on any amount of indemnity
not paid when due pursuant to this Article 9 until the
same shall be paid, at the Past Due Rate.

occurred and is continuing under the Lease, (B)
during a period following an Event of Loss or (C)
in connection with the termination of the Lease
or action or direction of Lessee with respect to
the Aircraft pursuant to Section 4.02 (other than
any sale at fair market value) or Article 7, 8, 9 or
10 of the Lease (with the Owner Participant being
responsible for any such fees and expenses in the
case of any other offer, sale or transfer); and

(ii) to pay the fees, costs and expenses of
all appraisers involved in an independent
appraisal of the Aircraft to the extent required
under Section 4.03 of the Lease.

of the Indenture) made in its individual capacity
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or
the other Operative Agreements to which it is a party.

Section 16.08. Severability. Any provision
of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable

Section 16.10. Certain Limitations on
Reorganization. The Indenture Trustee agrees that, if
(1) all or any part of the Lessor's Estate becomes the
property of a debtor subject to the reorganization
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, (2) pursuant to
such reorganization provisions the Owner Participant
is required, by reason of the Owner Participant being
held to have recourse liability to the debtor or the
trustee of the debtor, directly or indirectly, to make
payment on account of any amount payable as principal
of or interest, Make-Whole Premium or other amounts
payable on the Certificates (other than as
contemplated by the Operative Agreements), and (3) the
Indenture Trustee actually receives any Recourse
Amount which reflects any payment by the Owner
Participant on account of (2) above, then, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, and subject to the
receipt by the Indenture Trustee prior to its
disbursement of such Recourse Amount of written notice
from the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee
reasonably relating to the refund obligation in this
sentence, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly refund
to the Owner Participant such Recourse Amount. For
purposes of this Section 16.10, "Recourse Amount"
means the amount by which the payment by the Owner
Participant on account of clause (ii) above received
by the Indenture Trustee exceeds the amount which
would have been received by the Indenture Trustee if
the Owner Participant had not become subject to the
recourse liability referred to in (ii) above. Nothing
contained in this paragraph shall prevent the
Indenture Trustee from enforcing any personal recourse
obligation (and retaining the proceeds thereof) of the
Owner Participant under this Agreement, the Indenture
(other than referred to in clause (2) above), any
Demand Note or the Trust Agreement (and any exhibits
or annexes thereto), or from retaining any amount paid
by the Owner Participant under Sections 5.01, 8.02 and
8.03 of the Indenture. Nothing contained herein shall
be construed as requiring any Holder to refund any
amount distributed to such Holder pursuant to the
Indenture.

SECTION 16.11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK, INCLUDING MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDLY
AND PERFORMANCE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

Section 16.12. Section 1110 Compliance.
Notwithstanding any provision herein or elsewhere
contained to the contrary, it is understood and agreed
among the parties hereto that the transactions
contemplated by this Participation Agreement, the
Lease, the Agreement to Lease, the Indenture and the
other Operative Agreements are expressly intended to
be, shall be and should be construed so as to be,
entitled to the full benefits of 11 U.S.C. Section 1110
as amended form time to time and any successor provision
thereto.

this nature, any non-public information supplied to it

** Insert in the case of a guarantee in connection with a

[WHEREAS, the terms of the Trust Agreement provide
that the aforementioned transfer is conditioned upon the
execution and delivery of this Guarantee by the Guarantor;]*

NOW, THEREFORE, [in order that the Transferor may
make the aforementioned transfer to the Obligor,]* the
Guarantor hereby agrees with and for the benefit of the
Beneficiaries as follows:

1. Definitions. As used in this Guarantee, terms
defined in the Participation Agreement are used herein as
therein defined, unless otherwise defined herein.

2. Guarantee. a. The Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as primary
obligor and not merely as a surety to the Beneficiaries and
their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and
assigns, the prompt and complete payment by the Obligor when
due (whether at the stated due date thereof, by acceleration
or otherwise) of, and the faithful performance of, and
compliance with, all payment obligations of the Obligor
under the Operative Agreements or any related documents owed
to such Beneficiary, strictly in accordance with the terms
thereof and the timely performance of all other obligations
of the Obligor owed to such Beneficiary thereunder strictly
in accordance with the terms thereof (such payment and other
obligations, the "Obligations"), and the Guarantor further
agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, all reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel) that may be paid or incurred by the Beneficiaries
in enforcing, or obtaining advice of counsel in respect of,
any rights with respect to, or collecting, any or all of the
Obligations and/or enforcing any rights with respect to, or
collecting against, the Guarantor under this Guarantee.

b. No payment or payments made by the Obligor,
the Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other Person or
received or collected by any Beneficiary from the Obligor,
the Guarantor, any other guarantor or any other person by
virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or
appropriation or application at any time or from time to
time in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall
be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the
liability of the Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations
are paid and performed in full.

- --------------
* Insert in the case of a guarantee in connection with a
transfer.

c. If for any reason any Obligation to be
performed or observed by the Obligor (whether affirmative or
negative in character) shall not be observed or performed
strictly in accordance with the terms thereof, or if any
amount payable by the Obligor in connection with any
Obligation shall not be paid promptly when due and payable,
the Guarantor shall perform or observe or cause to be
performed or observed each such Obligation or undertaking
and shall pay such amount at the place and to the person or
entity entitled thereto pursuant to the Operative Agreements
regardless of whether or not any Beneficiary or anyone
acting on behalf of any of them shall have instituted any
suit, action or proceeding or exhausted its remedies or
taken any steps to enforce any rights against the Obligor or
any other person or entity to compel any such performance or
to collect all or any part of such amount pursuant to the
provisions of the Operative Agreements or at law or in
equity, or otherwise, and regardless of any other condition
or contingency.

d. The Guarantor irrevocably waives promptness,
diligence, demand, and all notices whatsoever as to the
Obligations and covenants guaranteed hereby, and any other
circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense
available to it, or a discharge of it (other than the
defense of payment or performance) and agrees that it shall
not be required to consent to or receive any notice of any
amendment or modification of, or waiver, consent or
extension with respect to, the Participation Agreement, the
Trust Agreement or the other Operative Agreements to which
the Obligor is a party that may be made or given as provided
herein or otherwise.

e. The Guarantor further agrees to pay all
expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel) that may be paid or incurred
by the beneficiaries hereof in enforcing any rights with
respect to, or collecting, any or all of the Obligations
and/or enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting
against, the Guarantor under this Guarantee.

f. The Guarantor understands and agrees that its
Obligations hereunder shall be construed as continuing,
absolute and unconditional without regard to (a) the
validity, regularity or enforceability of any Operative
Agreement, any of the Obligations or any collateral security
therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect
thereto at any time or from time to time held by any
Beneficiary, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other
than a defense of full payment or performance) that may at
any time be available to or be asserted by the Obligor
against any Beneficiary, or (c) any other circumstances
whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the
Obligor or the Guarantor) that constitutes, or might be
construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of
the Obligor for the Obligations, or of the Guarantor under
this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance.

g. The obligation of the Guarantor hereunder
will not be discharged by: (a) any extension or renewal
with respect to any obligation of the Obligor under the
Operative Agreements; (b) any modification of, or amendment
or supplement to, any such Operative Agreement; (c) any
furnishing or acceptance of additional security or any
release of any security; (d) any waiver, consent or other
action or inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of any
right, remedy or power with respect to the Obligor or any
change in the structure of the Obligor; (e) any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, composition,
liquidation, dissolution or similar proceedings with respect
to the Obligor; (f) except as provided in Section 14 hereof,
any change in ownership of the shares of capital stock of
the Guarantor or the Obligor; or (g) any other occurrence
whatsoever, except payment in full of all amounts payable by
the Obligor under the Operative Agreements and performance
in full of all Obligations of the Obligor in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Operative Agreements.

3. No Subrogation, Contribution, Reimbursement or
Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Guarantee, the Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert any
rights which may have arisen in connection with this
Guarantee to be subrogated to any of the rights (whether
contractual, under the Bankruptcy Code, including Section
509 thereof, under common law or otherwise) of any
Beneficiary against the Obligor or against any Beneficiary
for the payment of the Obligations until indefeasible
payment or performance in full of the Obligations. The
Guarantor hereby further agrees not to assert any
contractual, common law, statutory or other rights of
reimbursement, contribution, exoneration or indemnity (or
any similar right) from or against the Obligor or any other
Person which may have arisen in connection with this
Guarantee if any payment under this Guarantee is outstanding
at such time. So long as any payment under this Guarantee
is outstanding, if any amount shall be paid by or on behalf
of the Obligor to the Guarantor on account of any of the
rights referred to above in this paragraph, such amount
shall be held by the Guarantor in trust, segregated from
other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon
receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the applicable
Beneficiary in the exact form received by the Guarantor
(duly endorsed by the Guarantor to the applicable
Beneficiary, if required).

4. Amendment with Respect to the Obligations;
Waiver of Rights. The Guarantor shall remain fully
obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any
reservation of rights against the Guarantor and without
notice to or further assent by the Guarantor, any demand for
payment or performance of any of the Obligations made by any
Beneficiary may be rescinded by such party and any of the
Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability
of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any
collateral security or guaranty therefor or right of offset
with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in
part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated,
compromised, waived, surrendered or released by any
Beneficiary and any Operative Agreement and/or any
collateral security document or other guaranty or document
in connection therewith, may be amended, modified,
supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in
accordance with the provisions thereof from time to time,
and any collateral security, guaranty or right of offset at
any time held by any Beneficiary for the payment or
performance of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged,
waived, surrendered or released. No Beneficiary shall have
any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any
Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations
or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto. When
making any demand hereunder against the Guarantor, a
Beneficiary may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a
similar demand on the Obligor or any other guarantor, and
any failure by a Beneficiary to make any such demand or to
collect any payments from the Obligor or any such other
guarantor or any release of the Obligor or such other
guarantor shall not relieve the Guarantor of its obligations
or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the
rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of
law, of any Beneficiary against the Guarantor. For the
purposes hereof, "demand" shall include, but not be limited
to, the commencement and continuance of any legal
proceedings. [The Guarantor represents and warrants that it
owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the capital stock of
the Obligor and that its obligations hereunder shall
continue unimpaired, even if the Guarantor no longer owns,
directly or indirectly, all or any portion of the capital
stock of the Obligor.]*

* Insert in the case of a guarantee in connection with a
transfer.

5. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. The
Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation,
renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and
notice of or proof of reliance by any Beneficiary upon this
Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Obligations,
and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been
created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended,
amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee; and all
dealings between the Obligor or the Guarantor and any
Beneficiary shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have
been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee.
The Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand
for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon
the Transferee or the Guarantor with respect to the
Obligations. The Guarantor understands and agrees that this
Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and
unconditional guaranty of payment and performance (and not
merely of collectability) without regard to (a) the
validity, regularity or enforceability of any Operative
Agreement or any related agreement, any of the Obligations
or any collateral security therefor or guaranty or right of
offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time
held by any Beneficiary, (b) any defense, set-off or
counterclaim (other than a defense of full payment or
performance) that may at any time be available to or be
asserted by the Obligor against any Beneficiary, or (c) any
other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or
knowledge of the Obligor or the Guarantor) that constitutes,
or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal
discharge of the Obligor for the Obligations, or of the
Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any
other instance. When pursuing its rights and remedies
hereunder against the Guarantor, any Beneficiary may, but
shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and
remedies as it may have against the Obligor or any other
person or entity or against any collateral security or
guaranty for the Obligations or any right of offset with
respect thereto, and any failure by any Beneficiary to
pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any
payments from the Obligor or any such other person or entity
or to realize upon any such collateral security or guaranty
or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of
the Obligor or any such other person or entity or any such
collateral security, guaranty or right of offset, shall not
relieve the Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall
not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether
express, implied or available as a matter of law, of any
Beneficiary against the Guarantor. This Guarantee shall
remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance
with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantor and
the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the
benefit of the Beneficiaries, and their respective
successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, until the
earlier of (x) all of the Obligations and the obligations of
the Guarantor under this Agreement shall have been satisfied
by payment and performance in full, (y) the right, title and
interest of the Obligor shall have been transferred to a
Person meeting the requirements of Article 5 of the Trust
Agreement, it being understood that this Guarantee shall
remain in effect with respect to obligations of the Obligor
arising prior to such transfer and (z) the Obligor obtaining
a tangible net worth equalling or exceeding [$50,000,000
(Fifty Million Dollars)].* The Guarantor further agrees
that, without limiting the generality of this Guarantee, if
any Beneficiary (or any assignee thereof) shall be prevented
by applicable law from exercising its remedies (or any of
them) against the Obligor under any Operative Agreement such
Beneficiary (or any assignee thereof) shall be entitled to
receive hereunder from the Guarantor the sums that would
have otherwise been due from the Obligor had such remedies
been able to be exercised.

6. Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall continue
to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at
any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or
returned by any Beneficiary upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Obligor or
the Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of
a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or
similar officer for, the Obligor or the Guarantor or any
substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as
though such payments had not been made. The Guarantor shall
not commence any "case" (as defined in Title 11 of the
United States Code) against the Obligor.

7. Payments. The Guarantor hereby guarantees
that payments hereunder shall be paid without set-off,
counterclaim, deduction or withholding, and shall be made in
U.S. Dollars.

hereby represents and warrants that:

shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to
Section 13 hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise

have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and
conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in
exercising, on the part of any Beneficiary, any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.
No single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. A waiver by a Beneficiary of any right or
remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed
as a bar to any right or remedy that such Beneficiary would
otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and
remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised
singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.

12. Integration. This Guarantee represents the

guaranteeing the Obligations of the Obligor under the
Operative Agreements or provide such a guarantee from such a
bank, lending institution or corporation satisfactory to
each Beneficiary, so that there will then be existing both
such guaranty agreement as well as the guaranty agreement
executed by the Subsequent Guarantee; in such event, the
Beneficiaries shall have the right to enforce the
obligations of the Guarantor under such guaranty agreement
without first proceeding against the Subsequent Guarantor
under its guaranty referred to above.

* Replace with $40,000,000 if the Obligor is an Affiliate
of, or a partner of, LLG Aircraft Leasing, L.P.

15. Successors and Assigns. This Guarantee shall

THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER STATE.

17. Notices. All notices, requests and demands to
or upon the Guarantor or any Beneficiary to be effective
shall be in writing or by telegraph, facsimile or telex and,
unless otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be deemed

Attn: Corporate Trust Administration

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is hereby made to the Participation
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______),
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation

Security Bank of Utah, National Association (not

the meaning set forth in the Participation Agreement.

In order to induce you to enter into the

warrants and agrees with you as follows:

1. Lufthansa represents and warrants that
the representations and warranties made by it in
the Agreement to Lease, the Sales Agreement, the
bill of sale referred to in Section 4.01(e)(vi)
of the Participation Agreement, the Modification
Agreement and the Parts and Services Agreement
(together, the "Lufthansa Agreements"), are true
and correct as of the date hereof (except to the
extent any such representation or warranty
specifically relates to an earlier date, in which
case such representation or warranty shall have
been true and correct as of such date).

2. Lufthansa agrees to perform (i) all of
its obligations under the Lufthansa Agreements in
favor of the Owner Trustee or (ii) any such

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am the Senior Vice President and General
Counsel of Federal Express Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Federal"), and am familiar with the
transactions contemplated by the Participation
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______),
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation Agree-
ment"), among Federal, as Lessee, LLG Aircraft
Leasing, L.P., as Owner Participant, First Security
Bank of Utah, National Association, a national banking
association, as Owner Trustee, NationsBank of Georgia,
National Association, a national banking association,
as Indenture Trustee, NationsBank of South Carolina,
National Association, a national banking association,
as Pass Through Trustee, and Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, New York Branch. This opinion is being
delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(k)(i) of the
Participation Agreement. Capitalized terms shall have
the meanings assigned in the Participation Agreement.

The Participation Agreement provides, among
other things, for the financing of a portion of the
Owner Trustee's payment of the Purchase Price,
Modification Cost, Parts Cost and related expenses
with respect to one Airbus Model A310-203 aircraft
(the "Aircraft") using the proceeds from the public
offering of Pass Through Certificates. Three Series
of Pass Through Certificates will be issued by three
Pass Through Trusts formed to acquire, among other
securities, the Certificates bearing a particular
interest rate and having a particular Maturity that
will be issued under the Trust Indenture and Security
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______),
dated as of March 1, 1994 ("Indenture"), between First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association, as Owner
Trustee, and NationsBank of Georgia, National
Association, as Indenture Trustee.

In connection with the opinions expressed
below, I have examined or caused to be examined by
attorneys under my supervision, the Operative
Agreements (or, in the case of the Lease and the Lease
Supplement, the forms thereof attached as Exhibit B to
the Participation Agreement). We have relied upon
originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified
to our satisfaction, of such corporate records,
documents and other instruments as in our judgment are
relevant to rendering the opinions expressed below.
As to any facts material to the opinions expressed
below, we have relied upon the representations and
warranties made in the Operative Agreements, the
accuracy of which we have not independently
investigated or verified. In such examination, we
have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other
than the signatures of Federal) and the authenticity
of all documents submitted to us as originals and the
conformity with the originals of all documents
submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed that
each of the parties to each of the Operative
Agreements, other than Federal, has or had, at the
time of execution thereof, full power, authority and
legal right to enter into the Operative Agreements,
and that each Operative Agreement has or had, at the
time of execution thereof, been duly authorized by
each of such parties, and that each of the Operative
Agreements (other than the Lease, the Lease
Supplement, the Indenture and Security Agreement
Supplement and any other Operative Agreement not
required to be executed on or prior to the Closing
Date (the "Commencement Documents")) has been duly
executed and delivered by each of such parties.

Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion
that:

1. Federal is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a "citizen
of the United States" within the meaning of
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,
as amended (the "Act"), and has or had, on the date of
execution thereof, the corporate power and authority
to carry on its business as currently conducted and to
enter into and perform its obligations under the
Operative Agreements to which it is or is to be a
party. Federal is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing in the State of Tennessee and each
other state of the United States in which its
operations or the nature of its business requires
Federal to so qualify, except where the failure to so
quality would not have a material adverse impact on
Federal or its business.

2. Federal possesses all necessary
certificates, franchises, licenses, permits, rights
and concessions and consents which are material to the
operation of the routes flown by it and the conduct of
its business and operations as currently conducted,
and each such certificate, franchise, license, permit,
right and concession and consent is in full force and
effect.

3. Each of the Operative Agreements to which
Federal is or is to be a party has been duly
authorized by Federal. Each of such Operative
Agreements to which Federal is a party, other than any
Commencement Documents, has been duly executed and
delivered by Federal and together constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Federal
enforceable against Federal in accordance with its and
their terms.

4. Neither the execution and delivery by
Federal of the Operative Agreements to which Federal
is a party (other than the Commencement Documents),
nor the consummation of any of the transactions by
Federal contemplated thereby, nor the performance of
the obligations thereunder by Federal, did at the time
of execution and delivery, or does currently,
(a) require any stockholder approval or violate the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of Federal or
(b) conflict with or contravene the provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon the property of Federal, under any
law, governmental rule or regulation, or the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of Federal or
any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court of
governmental authority against Federal or by which any
of its properties may be bound or any indenture,
mortgage, contract or other agreement known to me to
which Federal is a party or by which it may be bound
or required the approval or consent of any trustee or
the holders of any indebtedness or obligations of
Federal.

5. Neither the execution and delivery by
Federal of the Operative Agreements to which it is a
party (other than the Commencement Documents), nor the
consummation of any transactions by Federal
contemplated thereby, nor the performance of the
obligations thereunder by Federal, did or does, as the
case may be, (a) require the consent or approval of,
the giving of notice to, or (except as described or
contemplated in the Participation Agreement and the
Lease, all of which are required to be performed on or
prior to the Closing Date or Commencement Date, as
specified in the Participation Agreement or the Lease,
and which shall have been accomplished on or prior to
the Closing Date or Commencement Date, as so
specified) the registration with, or the taking of any
other action in respect of, the FAA or any other
authority or agency of the federal government or of
the State of Tennessee, or (b) contravene any judgment
or order applicable to or binding on Federal or any
law or governmental rule or regulation of the United
States or of the State of Tennessee.

6. Except for the matters described under
"Legal Proceedings" in Federal's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1993 (as
updated by Note 7 to the financial statements included
in Federal's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
fiscal quarters ended August 31, 1993 and November 30,
1993), as to which I can express no opinion at this
time concerning Federal's liability (if any) or the
effect of any adverse determination upon the business,
condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of
Federal, there is no pending or to my knowledge
threatened action or proceeding before any court or
administrative agency which individually (or in the
aggregate in the case of any group of related
lawsuits) is expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition of Federal or the
ability of Federal to perform its obligations under
the Operative Agreements.

7. Federal is a duly certificated "air
carrier" within the meaning of the Act, and a holder
of a certificate under Section 401 of the Act, an all-
cargo certificate under Section 418 of the Act and an
"air carrier operating certificate" issued pursuant to
Section 604 of the Act, and each such certificate is
in full force and effect.

8. Federal is not, and is not directly or
indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of any
Person which is, an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.

The opinions expressed in paragraph 3 above
are based upon the assumption for purposes of such
opinions and without independent analysis that,
notwithstanding the respective choice of laws clauses
in the Operative Agreements, the governing law with
respect to each of the Operative Agreements is
identical in all relevant respects to the law of the
State of Tennessee. Insofar as the foregoing opinion
relates to the enforceability of any instrument, such
enforceability is subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally (whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

I do not express any opinion as to matters
governed by any law other than the federal laws of the
United States of America, the corporation law of the
State of Delaware and the laws of the State of
Tennessee.

This opinion is delivered to you solely for
your use in connection with the transactions described
herein, and may not be used for any other purpose, and
may not be relied upon by any other person, with the
exception of your successors and permitted assigns,
without my prior written consent.

I rendered an opinion dated September 1, 1993
(the "Agreement to Lease Opinion"), a copy of which is
attached hereto. I hereby consent and agree that the
addressees hereto who were not addressees to the
Agreement to Lease Opinion may rely on the Agreement
to Lease Opinion as fully and with the same force and
effect as if such addressees were originally named
therein on the date of the Agreement to Lease Opinion.

Very truly yours,

Kenneth R. Masterson

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am the Senior Vice President and General
Counsel of Federal Express Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Federal"), and am familiar with the
transactions contemplated by the Participation
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______),
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation Agree-
ment"), among Federal, as Lessee, LLG Aircraft
Leasing, L.P., as Owner Participant, First Security
Bank of Utah, National Association, a national banking
association, as Owner Trustee, NationsBank of Georgia,
National Association, a national banking association,
as Indenture Trustee, NationsBank of South Carolina,
National Association, a national banking association,
as Pass Through Trustee, and Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, New York Branch. This opinion is being
delivered pursuant to Section 4.02(j)(i) and
4.03(l)(i) of the Participation Agreement.
Capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned in
the Participation Agreement.

The Participation Agreement provides, among
other things, for the financing of a portion of the
Owner Trustee's payment of the Purchase Price,
Modification Cost, Parts Cost and related expenses
with respect to one Airbus Model A310-203 aircraft
(the "Aircraft") using the proceeds from the public
offering of Pass Through Certificates. Two Series of
Pass Through Certificates were issued by two Pass
Through Trusts formed to acquire, among other
securities, the Certificates bearing a particular
interest rate and having a particular Maturity that
were issued under the Trust Indenture and Security
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______),
dated as of March 1, 1994 ("Indenture"), between First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association, as Owner
Trustee, and NationsBank of Georgia, National
Association, as Indenture Trustee.

In connection with the opinions expressed
below, I have examined or caused to be examined by
attorneys under my supervision, the Operative
Agreements. We have relied upon originals or copies,
certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction,
of such corporate records, documents and other
instruments as in our judgment are relevant to
rendering the opinions expressed below. As to any
facts material to the opinions expressed below, we
have relied upon the representations and warranties
made in the Operative Agreements, the accuracy of
which we have not independently investigated or
verified. In such examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures (other than the
signatures of Federal) and the authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals and the
conformity with the originals of all documents
submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed that
each of the parties to each of the Operative
Agreements, other than Federal, has or had, on the
date of execution thereof, full power, authority and
legal right to enter into the Operative Agreements,
and that each Operative Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each of such
parties.

Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion
that:

1. Federal is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a "citizen
of the United States" within the meaning of
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,
as amended (the "Act"), and has or had, on the date of
execution thereof, the corporate power and authority
to carry on its business as currently conducted and to
enter into and perform its obligations under the
Operative Agreements to which it is a party. Federal
is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in the State of Tennessee and each other
state of the United States in which its operations or
the nature of its business requires Federal to so
qualify, except where the failure to so quality would
not have a material adverse impact on Federal or its
business.

2. Federal possesses all necessary
certificates, franchises, licenses, permits, rights
and concessions and consents which are material to the
operation of the routes flown by it and the conduct of
its business and operations as currently conducted,
and each such certificate, franchise, license, permit,
right and concession and consent is in full force and
effect.

3. Each of the Operative Agreements to which
Federal is a party has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by Federal and together constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Federal
enforceable against Federal in accordance with its and
their terms.

4. Neither the execution and delivery by
Federal of the Operative Agreements to which Federal
is a party, nor the consummation of any of the
transactions by Federal contemplated thereby, nor the
performance of the obligations thereunder by Federal,
did at the time of execution and delivery, or does
currently, (a) require any stockholder approval or
violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of
Federal or (b) conflict with or contravene the
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon the property
of Federal, under any law, governmental rule or
regulation, or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws of Federal or any order, writ, injunction or
decree of any court of governmental authority against
Federal or by which any of its properties may be bound
or any indenture, mortgage, contract or other
agreement known to me to which Federal is a party or
by which it may be bound or required the approval or
consent of any trustee or the holders of any
indebtedness or obligations of Federal.

5. Neither the execution and delivery by
Federal of the Operative Agreements to which it is a
party, nor the consummation of any transactions by
Federal contemplated thereby, nor the performance of
the obligations thereunder by Federal, did or does, as
the case may be, (a) require the consent or approval
of, the giving of notice to, or (except as described
or contemplated in the Participation Agreement and the
Lease, all of which were or are required to be
performed on or prior to the Closing Date or
Commencement Date, as specified in the Participation
Agreement or the Lease, and which were or shall have
been accomplished on or prior to the Closing Date or
Commencement Date, so specified) the registration
with, or the taking of any other action in respect of,
the FAA or any other authority or agency of the
federal government or of the State of Tennessee, or
(b) contravene any judgment or order applicable to or
binding on Federal or any law or governmental rule or
regulation of the United States or of the State of
Tennessee.

6. Except for the matters described under
"Legal Proceedings" in Federal's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the most recent fiscal year for which such
Report is available (as updated by Note 7 to the
financial statements included in Federal's Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for any more recent fiscal
quarter for which such Report is available), as to
which I can express no opinion at this time concerning
Federal's liability (if any) or the effect of any
adverse determination upon the business, condition
(financial or otherwise) or operations of Federal,
there is no pending or to my knowledge threatened
action or proceeding before any court or
administrative agency which individually (or in the
aggregate in the case of any group of related
lawsuits) is expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition of Federal or the
ability of Federal to perform its obligations under
the Operative Agreements.

7. Except for the filing for recordation
pursuant to the Act of the Indenture, the Indenture
and Security Agreement Supplement, the Lease and the
Lease Supplement, the Trust Agreement and the Trust
Agreement Supplement covering the Aircraft, no further
action, including any filing or recording of any
document is necessary or advisable in order to
establish and perfect the Owner Trustee's title to and
interest in the Aircraft as against Federal and any
third parties, or to perfect any security interest in
the Aircraft in favor of the Indenture Trustee, as
assignee of the Owner Trustee, except for the filing
of continuation statements at periodic intervals as
required, in each case with respect to such portion of
the Aircraft as is covered by the recording system
established by the Act.

8. Federal is a duly certificated "air
carrier" within the meaning of the Act, and a holder
of a certificate under Section 401 of the Act, an all-
cargo certificate under Section 418 of the Act and an
"air carrier operating certificate" issued pursuant to
Section 604 of the Act, and each such certificate is
in full force and effect.

9. Federal is not, and is not directly or
indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of any
Person which is, an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.

10. Federal, as Lessee, duly accepted the
Aircraft under the Lease and the Lease Supplement and
the Term commenced.

11. Federal's principal place of business
and chief executive office (as such term is defined in
the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of
Tennessee) are located at 2005 Corporate Avenue,
Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee.

The opinions expressed in paragraph 3 above
are based upon the assumption for purposes of such
opinions and without independent analysis that,
notwithstanding the respective choice of laws clauses
in the Operative Agreements, the governing law with
respect to each of the Operative Agreements is
identical in all relevant respects to the law of the
State of Tennessee. Insofar as the foregoing opinion
relates to the enforceability of any instrument, such
enforceability is subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally (whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). The enforceability of certain
remedies provided under the Lease may also be limited
by applicable laws which may affect the remedies
provided therein but which do not in my opinion affect
the validity of the Lease or make such remedies
inadequate for the practical realization of the
benefits intended to be provided thereby.

I do not express any opinion as to matters
governed by any law other than the federal laws of the
United States of America, the corporation law of the
State of Delaware and the laws of the State of
Tennessee.

As to the matters referred to in paragraph 3,
I have relied on the opinion of Daugherty, Fowler &
Peregrin of even date herewith, to the extent such
matters are addressed in such counsel's opinion.

This opinion is delivered to you solely for
your use in connection with the transactions described
herein, and may not be used for any other purpose, and
may not be relied upon by any other person, with the
exception of your successors and permitted assigns,
without my prior written consent.

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel for LLG Aircraft
Leasing, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Owner Participant"), LLG of Delaware, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "General Partner") and
Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft, a German
corporation ("Lufthansa"), in connection with the
transactions contemplated by (i) the Participation
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______),
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation
Agreement"), among Federal Express Corporation, as
Lessee (the "Lessee"), the Owner Participant, First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association, as Owner
Trustee (the "Owner Trustee"), NationsBank of Georgia,
National Association, as Indenture Trustee (the
"Indenture Trustee"), NationsBank of South Carolina,
National Association, as Pass Through Trustee (the
"Pass Through Trustee"), and Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, New York Branch, as LC Bank, and (ii)
the Agreement to Lease referred to in the
Participation Agreement. This opinion is delivered
pursuant to Section 4.01(k)(ii) of the Participation
Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, all
capitalized terms used herein shall have the
respective meanings set forth or referred to in the
Participation Agreement.

In connection with our opinions expressed
herein, we have examined executed counterparts of the
Operative Agreements (other than the Lease, the Lease
Supplement, the Trust Agreement Supplement covering
the Aircraft and the Indenture and Security Agreement
Supplement (the "Commencement Documents"), the forms
of which we have examined). We have further examined
and relied upon the accuracy of original, certified,
conformed, photographic or telecopied copies of such
records, agreements, certificates and other documents
as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable
us to render the opinions expressed herein. In all
such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of
signatures on original documents and the conformity to
such original documents of all copies submitted to us
as certified, conformed, photographic or telecopied
copies, and as to certificates and telegraphic and
telephonic confirmations given by public officials, we
have assumed the same to have been properly given and
to be accurate. As to all matters of fact material to
our opinions, we have relied upon the accuracy of the
statements, representations and warranties made in the
Operative Agreements and certificates furnished to us,
and we have made no independent investigation or
verification with respect to such factual matters.

We have assumed (without making any
independent investigation or verification with respect
thereto) the due authorization, execution and delivery
of the Operative Agreements (other than the
Commencement Documents) and the other documents
executed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements (other than
the Commencement Documents) by each of the parties to
each such document (other than the Owner Participant
and the General Partner) and that each such document
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
each of such parties (other than the Owner
Participant, the General Partner and Lufthansa),
enforceable against each such party (other than the
Owner Participant, the General Partner and Lufthansa)
in accordance with its terms, that each such party
(other than the Owner Participant and the General
Partner) has or had, at the time of its execution
thereof, the requisite power, authority and legal
right to execute, deliver and perform each Operative
Agreement (other than any Commencement Document) to
which it is a party, and that the execution, delivery
and performance thereof by each such party (other than
the Owner Participant and the General Partner) do not
violate its respective partnership agreement, or
charter or by-laws, or any laws or governmental rules
or regulations (federal, state or otherwise) that may
be applicable to it, in any capacity in which it may
be acting, and that the transactions provided for in
the Operative Agreements are not within the
prohibition of Section 406 of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and
the matters hereinafter set forth, we are of the
opinion that:

(1) The Owner Participant is a duly
organized and validly existing limited
partnership in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware. The General Partner is a
duly incorporated and validly existing
corporation in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Each of the Owner
Participant and the General Partner has or had,
on the respective dates of execution thereof, the
requisite partnership or corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under the Operative Agreements to
which it is a party.

(2) Each Operative Agreement to which the
Owner Participant or the General Partner is a
party, and each assignment of a Demand Note, has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Owner Participant, the General Partner or the
assignor, as the case may be.

(3) Each Operative Agreement to which the
Owner Participant, the General Partner or
Lufthansa is a party, and each assignment of a
Demand Note, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Owner Participant, the
General Partner, Lufthansa or the assignor, as
the case may be, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and public policy considerations (in
the case of the indemnity provisions contained
therein), and subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

(4) Assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of the Indenture and the
Collateral Agreement by each of the parties to
each such document then: (A) each such document
constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement
of each party thereto enforceable against each
such party in accordance with its terms; (B) the
Indenture creates, for the benefit of the
Holders, the security interest in the Collateral
that it purports to create as of the Closing
Date; and (C) the beneficial interest of the
Owner Participant under the Trust Agreement in
and to the properties which are part of the Trust
Indenture Estate is subject, to the extent
provided in the Indenture, to the Lien of the
Indenture in favor of the Holders.

(5) Neither the execution and delivery of
any of the Operative Agreements to which the
Owner Participant, the General Partner or
Lufthansa is a party, by the Owner Participant,
the General Partner or Lufthansa, as the case may
be, nor the consummation by the Owner
Participant, the General Partner or Lufthansa, as
the case may be, of the transactions contemplated
thereby, (A) required or requires the consent or
approval of, the giving of notice to, the
registration with, or the taking of any other
action with respect to, any governmental
authority or agency of the State of New York or
the federal government of the United States of
America; (B) contravened or contravenes any law,
governmental rule or regulation of the State of
New York or the federal government of the United
States of America; (C) results in the breach of
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the
partnership agreement, or charter or by-laws, of
the Owner Participant or the General Partner, as
the case may be; or (D) is in violation of any
law, judgment or order applicable to or binding
upon the Owner Participant or the General
Partner, as the case may be, or its properties,
or, to the best of our knowledge, would violate
or would subject the Lessor's Estate to any Lien
under any indenture, mortgage, bank credit
agreement, note or bond purchase agreement, long-
term lease, license or contract or any other
agreement or instrument to which the Owner
Participant or the General Partner is a party or
by which the Owner Participant or the General
Partner is bound.

(6) There are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending or, to the best of our
knowledge, threatened against or affecting the
Owner Participant or the General Partner in any
court or before any administrative agency or
arbitrator, which, if adversely determined, would
materially and adversely affect the ability of
the Owner Participant or the General Partner to
perform its obligations under any of the
Operative Agreements to which it is a party, and
we are not aware of any pending or threatened
actions or proceedings before any court,
administrative agency or tribunal involving the
Owner Participant or the General Partner in
connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Operative Agreements.

We express no opinions herein as to the laws
of any state or jurisdiction other than the laws of
the State of New York and the federal laws of the
United States of America. In addition, no opinion is
expressed herein as to (i) any state or federal
securities laws, (ii) any state or federal tax laws,
(iii) except as provided in paragraph (4) above, the
perfection or priority of any security interest
created by any of the Operative Agreements or the
right, title or interest in or to the Lessor's Estate
on the part of any Person, or (iv) matters governed by
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, or by
any other aviation law or law, statute, rule or
regulation of the United States of America relating to
the acquisition, ownership, leasing, registration,
use, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, sale
or particular nature of the Aircraft, Airframe or
Engines.

In rendering the opinions expressed herein,
with respect to all matters of German law we have
relied (without making any independent investigation
with respect thereto) upon the opinion, dated today
and delivered to you, of Christian Rehm, in house
legal counsel of Lufthansa, and nothing has come to
our attention which would cause us to believe that you
and we are not justified in relying thereon. This
opinion is furnished by us at the request of the Owner
Participant, the General Partner and Lufthansa for
your sole benefit, and we agree that you may rely on
the opinions expressed herein. No other person or
entity shall be entitled to rely on the opinions
expressed herein without our express written consent.

This opinion shall not be published or
reproduced in any manner or distributed or circulated
to any person or entity without our express written
consent. This opinion is limited to the matters
stated herein and no opinion is implied or may be
inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein.

We rendered an opinion dated September 1,
1993 (the "Agreement to Lease Opinion"), a copy of
which is attached hereto. We hereby consent and agree
that the addressees hereto who were not addressees to
the Agreement to Lease Opinion may rely on the
Agreement to Lease Opinion as fully and with the same
force and effect as if such addressees were originally
named therein on the date of the Agreement to Lease
Opinion.

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel for LLG Aircraft
Leasing, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Owner Participant"), and LLG of Delaware, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "General Partner") (and
Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft, a German
corporation ("Lufthansa"),)** in connection with
the transactions contemplated by (i) the Participation
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______),
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation
Agreement"), among Federal Express Corporation, as
Lessee (the "Lessee"), the Owner Participant, First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association, as Owner
Trustee (the "Owner Trustee"), NationsBank of Georgia,
National Association, as Indenture Trustee (the
"Indenture Trustee"), NationsBank of South Carolina,
National Association, as Pass Through Trustee (the
"Pass Through Trustee"), and Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, New York Branch, as LC Bank, and (ii)
the Agreement to Lease referred to in the
Participation Agreement. This opinion is delivered
pursuant to Sections 4.02(j)(ii) and 4.03(l)(ii) of
the Participation Agreement. Unless otherwise defined
herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have
the respective meanings set forth or referred to in
the Participation Agreement.

* If the Exchange Date does not occur on the
Commencement date, a separate opinion, dated
the Exchange Date, shall be provided as to
all matters below, except as specifically
noted.

** Insert if an OP Guarantee is required
pursuant to the Participation Agreement.

In connection with our opinions expressed
herein, we have examined executed counterparts of the
Operative Agreements ((other than the Indenture and
Security Agreement Supplement, the form of which we
have examined))*. We have further examined and
relied upon the accuracy of original, certified,
conformed, photographic or telecopied copies of such
records, agreements, certificates and other documents
as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable
us to render the opinions expressed herein. In all
such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of
signatures on original documents and the conformity to
such original documents of all copies submitted to us
as certified, conformed, photographic or telecopied
copies, and as to certificates and telegraphic and
telephonic confirmations given by public officials, we
have assumed the same to have been properly given and
to be accurate. As to all matters of fact material to
our opinions, we have relied upon the accuracy of the
statements, representations and warranties made in the
Operative Agreements and certificates furnished to us,
and we have made no independent investigation or
verification with respect to such factual matters.

We have assumed (without making any
independent investigation or verification with respect
thereto) the due authorization, execution and delivery
of the Operative Agreements ((other than the Indenture
and Security Agreement Supplement))* and the other
documents executed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Agreements ((other than
the Indenture and Security Agreement Supplement))* by
each of the parties to each such document (other than
the Owner Participant and the General Partner) and
that each such document constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of each of such parties (other
than the Owner Participant and the General Partner
(and Lufthansa)**), enforceable against each such
party (other than the Owner Participant and the
General Partner (and Lufthansa)**) in accordance with
its terms, that each such party (other than the Owner

Participant and the General Partner) has or had, at
the time of its execution thereof, the requisite
power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver
and perform each Operative Agreement (other than any
Indenture and Security Agreement Supplement))* to
which it is a party, and that the execution, delivery
and performance thereof by each such party (other than
the Owner Participant and the General Partner) do not
violate its respective partnership agreement, or
charter or by-laws, or any laws or governmental rules
or regulations (federal, state or otherwise) that may
be applicable to it, in any capacity in which it may
be acting, and that the transactions provided for in
the Operative Agreements are not within the
prohibition of Section 406 of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and
the matters hereinafter set forth, we are of the
opinion that:

(1) The Owner Participant is a duly
organized and validly existing limited
partnership in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware. The General Partner is a
duly incorporated and validly existing
corporation in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Each of the Owner
Participant and the General Partner has or had,
on the respective dates of execution thereof, the
requisite partnership or corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under the Operative Agreements to
which it is a party.

(2) Each Operative Agreement to which the
Owner Participant or the General Partner is a
party has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Owner Participant or the General
Partner, as the case may be.

(3) Each Operative Agreement to which the
Owner Participant or the General Partner (or
Lufthansa)* is a party constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Owner
Participant or the General Partner (or

against it in accordance with its terms, except
as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and public policy considerations (in
the case of the indemnity provisions contained
therein), and subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

(4) Lufthansa has conveyed to the Owner
Trustee, good and marketable title to the
Aircraft, free and clear of all Liens other than
(i) the rights of the Lessee under the Lease,
(ii) the rights of the Owner Participant under
the Trust Agreement (and (iii) the rights of the
Indenture Trustee under the Indenture)* .

(5) Neither the execution and delivery of
any of the Operative Agreements to which the
Owner Participant or the General Partner (or
Lufthansa)** is a party, by the Owner Participant
or the General Partner (or Lufthansa)**, as the
case may be, nor the consummation by the Owner
Participant, the General Partner (or
Lufthansa)**, as the case may be, of the
transactions contemplated thereby, (A) required
or requires the consent or approval of, the
giving of notice to, the registration with, or
the taking of any other action with respect to,
any governmental authority or agency of the State
of New York or the federal government of the
United States of America; (B) contravened or
contravenes any law, governmental rule or

America; (C) results in the breach of any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of the
partnership agreement, or charter or by-laws, of

the Owner Participant or the General Partner, as
the case may be; or (D) is in violation of any
law, judgment or order applicable to or binding
upon the Owner Participant or the General
Partner, as the case may be, or its properties,
or, to the best of our knowledge, would violate
or would subject the Lessor's Estate to any Lien
under any indenture, mortgage, bank credit
agreement, note or bond purchase agreement, long-
term lease, license or contract or any other
agreement or instrument to which the Owner
Participant or the General Partner is a party or
by which the Owner Participant or the General
Partner is bound.

(6) There are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending or, to the best of our
knowledge, threatened against or affecting the
Owner Participant or the General Partner in any
court or before any administrative agency or
arbitrator, which, if adversely determined, would
materially and adversely affect the ability of
the Owner Participant or the General Partner to
perform its obligations under any of the
Operative Agreements to which it is a party, and
we are not aware of any pending or threatened
actions or proceedings before any court,
administrative agency or tribunal involving the
Owner Participant or the General Partner in
connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Operative Agreements.

We express no opinions herein as to the laws
of any state or jurisdiction other than the laws of
the State of New York and the federal laws of the
United States of America. In addition, no opinion is
expressed herein as to (i) any state or federal
securities laws, (ii) any state or federal tax laws,
(iii) the perfection or priority of any security
interest created by any of the Operative Agreements
or, except as provided in paragraph (4) above, as to
the right, title or interest in or to the Lessor's
Estate on the part of any Person, or (iv) except as
provided in paragraph (4) above, matters governed by
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, or by
any other aviation law or law, statute, rule or
regulation of the United States of America relating to
the acquisition, ownership, leasing, registration,
use, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, sale
or particular nature of the Aircraft, Airframe or
Engines.

As to the matters referred to in paragraph
(4), we have relied on the opinion of Daugherty,
Fowler & Peregrin of even date herewith, to the extent
such matters are addressed in such counsel's opinion.

Insofar as our opinions expressed herein
relate to the Tax Indemnity Agreement, such opinions
are being rendered solely to the Lessee.

(In rendering the opinions expressed herein,
with respect to all matters of German law we have
relied (without making any independent investigation
with respect thereto) upon the opinion, dated today
and delivered to you, a copy of which is attached
hereto, of (_______________), counsel to Lufthansa,
and nothing has come to our attention which would
cause us to believe that you and we are not justified
in relying thereon.)* This opinion is furnished by
us at the request of the Owner Participant, the
General Partner and Lufthansa for your sole benefit,
and we agree that you may rely on the opinions
expressed herein. No other person or entity shall be
entitled to rely on the opinions expressed herein
without our express written consent.

This opinion shall not be published or
reproduced in any manner or distributed or circulated

Gentlemen:

I am in-house legal counsel of Deutsche Lufthansa
Aktiengesellschaft ("Lufthansa") and have acted as legal
counsel for Lufthansa Leasing Projekt Nr. 7 GmbH ("LLP") and
as such have reviewed Promissory Note (ED-AICA), Promissory
Note (ED-AICB), Promissory Note (ED-AICC), Promissory Note
(ED-AICD), Promissory Note (ED-AICF), Promissory Note (ED-
AICH), Promissory Note (ED-AICK), Promissory Note (ED-AICL),
Promissory Note (ED-AICM), Promissory Note (ED-AICN),
Promissory Note (ED-AICP, Promissory Note (ED-AICR), and
Promissory Note (ED-AICS) (each, a "Demand Note" and
collectively, the "Demand Notes") as well as the assignment
of LLP's right, title and interest , to and under each
Demand Note (each, an "Assignment" and collectively, the
"Assignments").

I have examined originals or copies of such
company and corporate records of LLP and certificates of
public officials and of representatives of LLP as I have
deemed appropriate or necessary hereto.

In connection with my opinions expressed herein, I
have examined executed the Demand Notes. In my examination,
I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents and other materials submitted
to me as originals and the conformity with the originals
thereof of all documents and other materials submitted to me
as copies.

Likewise, and for the purposes of the opinions set
forth below, I have assumed that (i) each of the Demand
Notes has been duly authorized and has been duly executed
and delivered by Lufthansa, (ii) Lufthansa is duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, and has full power, authority
and legal right to make and perform its obligations under
each of the Demand Notes and (iii) each of the Demand Notes
is enforceable against Lufthansa.

Based on and in reliance upon the foregoing, I am
of the opinion that:

1. LLP is a company duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of Germany and has all requisite
power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted and has all requisite power and authority to enter
into and perform its obligations under the Assignments.

2. Neither the execution and delivery by LLP of
the Assignments nor the performance by LLP of its
obligations thereunder requires the consent or approval of,
the giving of notice to, or the registration or filing with,
or the taking of any other action in respect of, any German
government authority or agency.

3. The execution and delivery by LLP of the
Assignments and the performance by LLP of its obligations
thereunder have been approved and authorized by LLP and do
not require any approval or consent of any stockholder of
LLP.

4. Neither the execution and delivery by LLP of
the Assignments nor the consummation by LLP of the
transactions contemplated thereunder violates any law,
governmental rule or regulation of Germany applicable to
LLP.

5. The choice of New York law to govern the
Lufthansa Agreemeents is valid and binding as against
Lufthansa under the laws of Germany and all political
subdivisions thereof, and a German court would uphold such
choice of law in a legal proceeding to enforce the
Agreements brough in such court.

I am permitted to practice law in the Federal
Republic of Germany and do not express any opinion as to any
law other than the law of the Federal Republic of Germany.

to Section 4.01(k)(ii) of the Participation Agreement.
Capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise

thereto in the Participation Agreement (whether through
incorporation by reference or otherwise).

I have examined originals or copies of such

In connection with my opinions expressed herein, I

or the taking of any other action in respect of, any German
government authority or agency.

3. The execution and delivery by Lufthansa of the
Lufthansa Agreements and the performance by Lufthansa of its
obligations thereunder have been approved and authorized by
Lufthansa and do not require any approval or consent of any
stockholder of Lufthansa.

4. Neither the execution and delivery by
Lufthansa of the Lufthansa Agreements nor the consummation

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Gentlemen:

We are counsel for NationsBank of Georgia,
National Association, a national banking association
(the "Indenture Trustee"). In such capacity, we have
advised the Indenture Trustee with respect to
authorization, execution and delivery by the Indenture
Trustee of the Trust Indenture and Security Agreement
(Federal Express Corporation Trust ______) dated as of
March 1, 1994 (the "Indenture") between First Security
Bank of Utah, National Association, as Owner Trustee
(the "Owner Trustee"), and the Indenture Trustee, and
the Participation Agreement (Federal Express
Corporation Trust ______) dated as of March 1, 1994
(the "Participation Agreement"), among Federal Express
Corporation ("Federal Express"), LLG Aircraft Leasing,
L.P. (the "Owner Participant"), the Owner Trustee,
NationsBank of South Carolina, National Association,
as Pass Through Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New York Branch,
as LC Bank. Further, we have advised the Indenture
Trustee with respect to the authentication of one or
more Equipment Trust Certificates (the "Certificates")
referred to in the Indenture issued on the date
hereof.

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to
Section 4.01(k)(iii) of the Participation Agreement.
Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms
used herein shall have the meanings set forth or
referred to in the Participation Agreement.

In rendering this opinion, we have reviewed
the Operative Agreements to which the Indenture
Trustee is a party and such other documents as we have
deemed to be appropriate and relevant as a basis for
the opinions hereinafter set forth, including, without
limitation, certified copies of the By-laws of the
Indenture Trustee, a certificate of an officer of the
Indenture Trustee as to certain matters, including the
incumbency of the Officer of the Indenture Trustee who
executed the Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and
the Participation Agreement and who authenticated the
Certificates issued in connection therewith and a
certificate of the Comptroller of the Currency,
Washington, D.C. dated _________, as to the Indenture
Trustee's existence and authority to do business as a
national banking association and to act in a fiduciary
capacity.

In all such examinations we have assumed the
authenticity and completeness of all documents
submitted to us as original documents and the
conformity to original documents and completeness of
all documents submitted to us as photostatic, notarial
or certified copies. Based on the foregoing, it is
our opinion that:

1. The Indenture Trustee is a national
banking association validly existing under
the laws of the United States of America
holding a valid certificate to do business as
a national banking association, with banking
and trust powers, is a Citizen of the United
States as that term is defined in the Federal
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the "Act"),
and has the corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under the Indenture and the Collateral
Agreement and to authenticate the
Certificates delivered on the date hereof and
had on the date of execution thereof the
corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the
Participation Agreement.

2. The Indenture Trustee, in its
individual and trust capacities, has duly
authorized, executed and delivered the
Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and the
Participation Agreement. Assuming the other
parties thereto are legally bound, each of
the Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and
the Participation Agreement constitutes, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Indenture Trustee in its trust capacity (and,
to the extent provided in each such document,
in its individual capacity) enforceable
against the Indenture Trustee in its trust
capacity (and, to the extent provided in each
such document, in its individual capacity) in
accordance with its terms, except as the
provisions thereof may be limited by bank-
ruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other
similar laws generally affecting creditors'
rights from time to time in effect.

3. The Certificates delivered on the
date hereof have been duly authenticated and
delivered by the Indenture Trustee in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

4. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Indenture Trustee of the
Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and the
Participation Agreement are not in violation
of the Articles of Association or By-laws of
the Indenture Trustee or any law,
governmental rule or regulation of the United
States or the State of Georgia governing the
banking or trust powers of the Indenture
Trustee or, to our knowledge, any judgment,
order, indenture, mortgage, bank credit
agreement, note or bond purchase agreement,
long-term lease, license or other agreement
or instrument to which it is a party or by
which it or its properties may be bound.

5. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Indenture Trustee in its individual or
trust capacity, as the case may be, of the
Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and the
Participation Agreement, nor the consummation
by the Indenture Trustee, in its individual
or trust capacity, as the case may be, of any
of the transactions contemplated in any of
those documents, requires or required on the
date of execution thereof consent or approval
of, giving of notice to, or registration
with, or taking of any other action with
respect to, any federal or state governmental
authority or agency having jurisdiction over
the Indenture Trustee.

6. (a) Subject to the assumptions and
qualifications set forth herein and in sub-
paragraph 6(b) below and except to the extent
the Indenture Trustee forecloses on any
property which constitutes the Trust
Indenture Estate and any of such property is
located in Georgia, or to the extent the
Indenture Trustee engages in business in
Georgia as a result of such foreclosure,
(i) there are no fees, taxes or other charges
payable by the Holders, the Owner Trustee or
the Indenture Trustee (except taxes imposed
on fees payable to the Indenture Trustee) to
the State of Georgia or any political
subdivision thereof in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance of any of
the Pass Through Agreement, the Series
Supplements or the Operative Agreements or in
connection with the issuance and acquisition
of the Certificates or the beneficial
interests of the Holders in the Trust
Indenture Estate; (ii) neither the Indenture
Trustee nor the trust created under the
Indenture will be subject to any fee, tax or
other governmental charge under the laws of
the State of Georgia or any political
subdivision thereof in existence on the date
hereof, on, based on or measured by, directly
or indirectly, the gross receipts, net income
or value of the Trust Indenture Estate; and
(iii) there is no fee, tax or other
governmental charge under the laws of the
State of Georgia or any political subdivision
thereof in existence on the date hereof, on,
based on or measured by any payments under
the Certificates issued to the Holders by
reason of the creation of the trust under the
Indenture pursuant to the laws of the State
of New York or the Indenture Trustee's
performance of its duties under the Indenture
within the State of Georgia. We express no
opinion, however, as to whether or not any
fees, taxes or other charges are now or
hereafter may be payable by the Owner
Participant to the State of Georgia or any
political subdivision thereof in connection
with (x) the execution, delivery or
performance of the Indenture, the Collateral
Agreement, the Participation Agreement, the
Pass Through Agreement, any Series Supplement
or any of the other Operative Agreements or
(y) the making by the Owner Participant of
its investment in the Aircraft.

(b) The opinions set forth in the
immediately preceding subparagraph 6(a) are
subject in relevant part to and qualified by
the following assumptions, which we have made
with your knowledge:

(i) for purposes of taxes which
might be imposed upon the Owner
Trustee or the Lessor's Estate under
Chapter 5, Ad Valorem Taxation of
Property, or Chapter 6, Taxation of
Intangibles, Title 48, Revenue and
Taxation, Official Code of Georgia
Annotated ("O.C.G.A."), we have
assumed that (x) the Lessee will
make, in a timely manner, an annual
property tax return relating to the
Aircraft, in accordance with
Chapter 5, Article 12, Ad Valorem
Taxation of Airline Companies,
Title 48, Revenue and Taxation,
O.C.G.A., and (y) the return will
reflect that a tangible property tax
is due with respect to the Aircraft;

(ii) for purposes of taxes which
might be imposed upon the Lessor's
Estate or the Owner Trustee under
Chapter 6, Taxation of Intangibles,
Title 48, Revenue and Taxation,
O.C.G.A., we have assumed that as of
January 1 of each year there will be
no undistributed funds held in
either the Lessor's Estate or the
Trust Indenture Estate, except such
funds as shall be invested in those
types of obligations or evidences of
debt as are described in
Section 48-6-22(1), O.C.G.A.;

(iii) for purposes of taxes which
might be imposed upon the Lessor's
Estate or the Owner Trustee under
Chapter 7, Income Taxes, Title 48,
Revenue and Taxation, O.C.G.A., we
have assumed that (x) the Lessor's
Estate is a "Grantor Trust" for
Federal income tax purposes (i.e.,
the Owner Participant will be
treated as the owner of the Lessor's
Estate under Subpart E of Part I of
Subchapter J of the Internal Revenue
Code) and (y) the Owner Trustee and
the Owner Participant will report on
that basis for Federal income tax
purposes; and

(iv) for purposes of taxes which
might be imposed upon the Holders
under Chapter 6, Taxation of
Intangibles or Chapter 7, Income
Taxes, Title 48, Revenue and
Taxation, O.C.G.A., neither the
Certificates held by such Holders
nor the interest income thereon nor
any interest of such Holders in and
to the Trust Indenture Estate has
been derived from or has been or
will be acquired in the conduct of
or used incident to business carried
on by such Holders or property of
such Certificate Holders located in
the State of Georgia.

We express no opinion as to the correctness
of the foregoing assumptions but we are not aware of
any fact that causes us to believe that any such
assumption is incorrect; however, we have conducted no
independent investigation in this regard.

We are members of the Bar of the State of
Georgia and the opinions set forth herein are limited
to the laws of Georgia and, subject to the limitations
set forth herein, the federal laws of the United
States of America. With respect to the opinions set
forth above in paragraph 2 as to the validity, binding
effect and enforceability of the Indenture, the
Collateral Agreement and the Participation Agreement,
the governing law of which is expressly stated to be
that of the State of New York, we have assumed with
your permission that the Indenture, the Collateral
Agreement, and the Participation Agreement constitute
legal, valid, binding and enforceable documents or
instruments under the laws of the State of New York
(as to which assumption we express no opinion).
Further, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, we express no opinion with respect to
(i) except as set forth in paragraph 1 of this opinion
with respect to the citizenship of the Indenture
Trustee, the Act and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the impact of the Act upon matters set
forth in this opinion or any other aviation or other
laws, rules or regulations applicable to the
particular nature of the equipment to be acquired by
the Owner Trustee; (ii) federal securities laws,
including, without limitation, the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended, or state securities or blue sky laws;
(iii) title to any property, real or personal, or the
priority or perfection of any liens or security
interests; (iv) the authority or power of the
Indenture Trustee to exercise any rights or remedies
set forth in the Operative Agreements or to perform
any duties or obligations on its part to be performed
other than those that can be performed in the State of
Georgia; or (v) ERISA.

This opinion is being furnished only to the
parties to whom this opinion is addressed and is
solely for their benefit, and no other person or
entity shall be entitled to rely on this opinion
without our express prior written consent. This
opinion may not be used, circulated, quoted, published
or otherwise referred to for any purpose without our
express prior written consent. Our opinion is limited
to the matters stated herein, and no opinion is
implied or may be inferred beyond the opinions
expressly stated herein.

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Gentlemen:

We are counsel for NationsBank of Georgia,
National Association, a national banking association
(the "Indenture Trustee"). In such capacity, we have
advised the Indenture Trustee with respect to
authorization, execution and delivery by the Indenture
Trustee of the Trust Indenture and Security Agreement
(Federal Express Corporation Trust ______) dated as of
March 1, 1994, (the "Indenture") between First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association, as Owner
Trustee (the "Owner Trustee"), and the Indenture
Trustee, and the Participation Agreement (Federal
Express Corporation Trust ______) dated as of March 1,
1994 (the "Participation Agreement"), among Federal
Express Corporation ("Federal Express"), LLG Aircraft
Leasing, L.P. (the "Owner Participant"), the Owner
Trustee, NationsBank of South Carolina, National
Association, as Pass Through Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New
York Branch. Further, we have advised the Indenture
Trustee with respect to the authentication of one or
more Equipment Trust Certificates (the "Certificates")
referred to in the Indenture issued on the date
hereof.

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to
Section 4.03(l)(iii) of the Participation Agreement.
Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms
used herein shall have the meanings set forth or
referred to in the Participation Agreement.

In rendering this opinion, we have reviewed
the Operative Agreements to which the Indenture
Trustee is a party and such other documents as we have
deemed to be appropriate and relevant as a basis for
the opinions hereinafter set forth, including, without
limitation, certified copies of the By-laws of the
Indenture Trustee, a certificate of an officer of the
Indenture Trustee as to certain matters, including the
incumbency of the Officer of the Indenture Trustee who
executed the Indenture and the Participation Agreement
and who authenticated the Certificates issued in
connection therewith and a certificate of the
Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, D.C. dated
_________, as to the Indenture Trustee's existence and
authority to do business as a national banking
association and to act in a fiduciary capacity.

In all such examinations we have assumed the
authenticity and completeness of all documents
submitted to us as original documents and the
conformity to original documents and completeness of
all documents submitted to us as photostatic, notarial
or certified copies. Based on the foregoing, it is
our opinion that:

1. The Indenture Trustee is a national
banking association validly existing under
the laws of the United States of America
holding a valid certificate to do business as
a national banking association, with banking
and trust powers, is a Citizen of the United
States as that term is defined in the Federal
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the "Act"),
and has the corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under the Indenture.

2. The Indenture Trustee, in its
individual and trust capacities, has duly
authorized, executed and delivered the
Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and the
Participation Agreement. Assuming the other
parties thereto are legally bound, each of
the Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and
the Participation Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Indenture Trustee in its trust capacity (and,
to the extent provided in each such document,
in its individual capacity) enforceable
against the Indenture Trustee in its trust
capacity (and, to the extent provided in each
such document, in its individual capacity) in
accordance with its terms, except as the
provisions thereof may be limited by bank-
ruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other
similar laws generally affecting creditors'
rights from time to time in effect.

3. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Indenture Trustee of the
Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and the
Participation Agreement are not, or were not
on the date of execution, in violation of the
Articles of Association or By-laws of the
Indenture Trustee or any law, governmental
rule or regulation of the United States or
the State of Georgia governing the banking or
trust powers of the Indenture Trustee or, to
our knowledge, any judgment, order,
indenture, mortgage, bank credit agreement,
note or bond purchase agreement, long-term
lease, license or other agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which
it or its properties may be bound.

4. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Indenture Trustee, in its individual
or trust capacity, as the case may be, of the
Indenture, the Collateral Agreement and the
Participation Agreement, nor the consummation
by the Indenture Trustee, in its individual
or trust capacity, as the case may be, of any
of the transactions contemplated in any of
those documents, requires or required on the
date of execution thereof consent or approval
of, giving of notice to, or registration
with, or taking of any other action with
respect to, any federal or state governmental
authority or agency having jurisdiction over
the Indenture Trustee.

We express no opinion as to the correctness
of the foregoing assumptions but we are not aware of
any fact that causes us to believe that any such
assumption is incorrect; however, we have conducted no
independent investigation in this regard.

Re: Federal Express Corporation
Pass Through Certificates
Series 1994-A310-A1 and 1994-A310-A2

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are counsel for NationsBank of South
Carolina, National Association, a national banking
association (herein referred to as the "Association"),
acting as Pass Through Trustee (the "Pass Through
Trustee") with respect to the Pass Through Trust
Agreement, dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Pass
Through Trust Agreement"), as supplemented by the
Series Supplements dated the date hereof, designated
as Series Supplement 1994-A310-A1, 1994-A310-A2 and
1994-A310-A3, respectively (the "Series Supplements").
We have advised the Association with respect to the
Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series Supplements
and the Participation Agreements relating to the Pass
Through Trust Agreement and each designated Series
Supplement (the "Participation Agreements") among the
parties listed therein. Further, we have advised the
Pass Through Trustee with respect to the Pass Through
Certificates (the "Pass Through Certificates") issued
on the date hereof. Further, we are counsel for
NationsBank of Georgia, National Association, a
national banking association, an affiliate of the
Association, acting as Registrar, Paying Agent and
Authenticating Agent (the "Agent") with respect to the
Pass Through Certificates pursuant to the Registrar,
Authenticating and Paying Agency Agreement dated as of
the date hereof (the "Agency Agreement") among Federal
Express Corporation ("Federal Express"), the
Association and the Agent. The Association has
requested that we deliver this opinion to you pursuant
to the Participation Agreements and the Underwriting
Agreement among Federal Express and the Underwriters
and we understand and agree that you may rely on the
opinions expressed herein.

Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized
terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth or
referred to in the Participation Agreements, the Pass
Through Trust Agreement or the Series Supplements, as
applicable.

In rendering this opinion, we have reviewed
the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series
Supplements and the Operative Agreements in existence
on the date hereof and such other documents as we have
deemed to be appropriate and relevant as a basis for
the opinions hereinafter set forth, including, without
limitation, certified copies of the By-Laws of the
Association and a certificate of an officer of the
Association as to certain matters, including the
incumbency of the officer of the Association who, on
behalf of the Pass Through Trustee executed the
Participation Agreement, the Pass Through Trust
Agreement, the Series Supplements and the Pass Through
Certificates and certificates of the Comptroller of
the Currency, Washington, D.C. dated _____ as to the
Association's existence and authority to do business
as a national banking association and to act in a
fiduciary capacity. Additionally, as to certain facts
material to the opinions expressed herein, we have
relied upon representations and warranties contained
in the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series
Supplements, the Operative Agreements and upon the
certificates above described, without further
investigation.

In all such examinations we have assumed the
authenticity and completeness of all documents
submitted to us as original documents and the
conformity to original documents and completeness of
all documents submitted to us as photostatic,
facsimile, notarial or certified copies. Further, we
have assumed (x) the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the parties thereto, other than
the Association and the Pass Through Trustee, of the
Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series Supplements
and the Operative Agreements to which each is a party,
(y) that each such other party has the power,
authority and legal right to execute, deliver and
perform each such document and (z) that the Operative
Agreements constitute the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of each such other party.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the assumptions
and qualifications herein contained, it is our opinion
that:

1. The Association is a national banking
association validly existing and holding a valid
certificate to do business as a national banking
association, with trust powers, is a Citizen of the
United States as that term is defined in the Federal
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, and, in its
individual capacity (to the extent provided therein)
or as Pass Through Trustee, has full corporate power
and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the
terms of the Participation Agreements, the Pass
Through Trust Agreement, the Series Supplements, the
Pass Through Certificates and the other Operative
Agreements to which it is a party.

2. The Association (in its individual
capacity, to the extent provided therein), or the Pass
Through Trustee, has duly authorized, executed and
delivered the Participation Agreements, the Pass
Through Trust Agreement and the Series Supplements,
and the Participation Agreements, the Pass Through
Trust Agreement and the Series Supplements constitute
the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations
of the Association (in its individual capacity, to the
extent provided therein), or the Pass Through Trustee,
enforceable against the Association (in its individual
capacity, to the extent provided therein), or the Pass
Through Trustee, in accordance with their respective
terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or
other similar laws affecting creditor's rights
generally, and except as enforcement thereof is
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

3. The Pass Through Certificates have been
duly authorized and validly executed, issued, and
delivered by the Pass Through Trustee and
authenticated by the Pass Through Trustee, acting
through the Agent, pursuant to the respective Pass
Through Trust Agreement, the Series Supplements and
the Agency Agreement, and the Pass Through
Certificates acquired by the Underwriters under the
Underwriting Agreement are enforceable against the
Pass Through Trustee and are entitled to the benefits
of the Pass Through Trust Agreement and the related
Series Supplements.

4. The authorization, execution, delivery
and performance by the Association (in its individual
capacity, to the extent provided therein), or the Pass
Through Trustee, of the Participation Agreements, the
Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series Supplements
and the other Operative Agreements to which it is a
party and the consummation of the transactions therein
contemplated and compliance with the terms thereof,
and the issuance of the Pass Through Certificates
thereunder do not and will not result in the violation
of the provisions of the Articles of Association or
By-Laws of the Association, and do not and will not
conflict with, or result in a breach of any terms or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or
result in the creation or the imposition of any Lien
upon any property or assets of the Pass through
Trustee, under any indenture, mortgage or other
agreement or instrument known to us to which the Pass
Through Trustee is a party or by which it or any of
its property is bound, or any South Carolina or
Federal law, rule or regulation governing the
Association's banking or trust powers, or of any
judgment, order or decree known to us to be applicable
to the Association or the Pass Through Trustee, of any
court, regulatory body, administrative agency,
government or governmental body having jurisdiction
over the Association or the Pass Through Trustee or
its properties.

5. No authorization, approval, consent,
license or order of, giving of notice to, registration
with, or taking of any other action in respect of, any
Federal or state governmental authority or agency
pursuant to any Federal or South Carolina law
governing the banking or trust powers of the
Association, is required for the authorization, execu-
tion, delivery and performance by the Association (in
its individual capacity to the extent provided
therein), or the Pass Through Trustee, of the
Participation Agreements, the Pass Through Trust
Agreement, the Series Supplements, the Pass Through
Certificates and the other Operative Agreements to
which it is a party or the consummation of any of the
transactions by the Association or the Pass Through
Trustee contemplated thereby or the issuance of the
Pass Through Certificates under the Pass Through Trust
Agreement and the Series Supplements (except such as
shall have been duly obtained, given or taken); and
such authorization, execution, delivery, performance,
consummation, and issuance do not conflict with or
result in a breach of the provisions of any such law.

6. There are no proceedings pending, or to
the best of our knowledge, threatened, and to the best
of our knowledge there is no existing basis for any
such proceeding against or affecting the Association
before any governmental authority which would, either
in any one case or in the aggregate, if adversely
determined, materially and adversely affect the
Association's ability to perform its obligations under
any of the Operative Agreements to which it is a
party. To the best of our knowledge, the Association
is not in default with respect to any order of any
governmental authority which default would, either in
any one case or in the aggregate, materially adversely
affect the Association's ability to perform its
obligations under any of the Operative Agreements to
which it is a party.

7. There are no taxes, fees or other
governmental charges payable under the laws of the
State of South Carolina or any political subdivision
thereof in connection with the execution and delivery
by the Association (in its individual capacity, to the
extent provided therein) or the Pass Through Trustee,
of the Participation Agreements, the Pass Through
Trust Agreement, the Series Supplements and the other
Operative Agreements to which it is a party or in
connection with the execution, issuance and delivery
of the Pass Through Certificates by the Pass Through
Trustee, pursuant to the Pass Through Trust Agreement
and the Series Supplements.

8. None of the trusts created by the Pass
Through Trust Agreement and the Series Supplements,
the Pass Through Trustee or the Association, or the
Affiliates, successors or assigns of any such Person,
will be subject to any tax (including, without
limitation, net or gross income, tangible or
intangible property, net worth, capital, franchise or
doing business tax), fee or other governmental charge
under the laws of the State of South Carolina or any
political subdivision thereof (other than taxes
imposed on the fees received by the Association for
acting as Pass Through Trustee under the Pass Through
Trust Agreement and the Series Supplements). Pass
Through Certificate holders who are not residents of
or otherwise subject to tax in South Carolina will not
be subject to any tax (including, without limitation,
net or gross income, tangible or intangible property,
net worth, capital, franchise or doing business tax),
fee or other governmental charge under the laws of the
State of South Carolina or any political subdivision
thereof as a result of purchasing, owning (including
receiving payments with respect to) or selling a Pass
Through Certificate. There are no applicable taxes
under the laws of the State of South Carolina or any
political subdivision thereof upon or with respect to
(a) the construction, mortgaging, financing,
refinancing, purchase, acquisition, acceptance,
rejection, delivery, nondelivery, transport, location,
ownership, insurance, control, assembly, possession,
repossession, operation, use, condition, maintenance,
repair, sale, return, abandonment, replacement,
preparation, installation, storage, redelivery,
manufacture, leasing, subleasing, modification,
rebuilding, importation, transfer of title, transfer
of registration, exportation or other application or
disposition of the Aircraft or any interest in any
thereof, (b) payments of Rent or other receipts,
income or earnings arising therefrom or received with
respect to the Aircraft or any interest in any thereof
or payable pursuant to the Lease, (c) any amount paid
or payable pursuant to any Operative Agreements or
Agreement to Lease Operative Agreements (as defined in
the Agreement to Lease), (d) the Aircraft or any
interest therein or the applicability of the Lease to
the Aircraft or any interest in any thereof, (e) any
or all of the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series
Supplements and the Operative Agreements, any or all
of the Pass Through Certificates or any interest in
any or all thereof or the offering, registration,
reregistration, issuance, acquisition, modification,
assumption, reissuance, refinancing or refunding of
any or all thereof, and any other documents
contemplated thereby and amendments or supplements
thereto, (f) the payment of the principal of, or
interest or premium on, or other amounts payable with
respect to, any or all of the Pass Through
Certificates, whether as originally issued or pursuant
to any refinancing, refunding, assumption,
modification or reissuance, or any other obligation
evidencing any loan in replacement of the loan
evidenced by any or all of the Pass Through Cer-
tificates, or (g) otherwise with respect to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series Supplements
and the Operative Agreements, which would not have
been imposed if the Pass Through Trustee had not had
its principal place of business in, had not performed
(either in its individual capacity or as Pass Through
Trustee) any or all of its administrative duties under
the Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Series
Supplements and the Operative Agreements in, and had
not engaged in any activities unrelated to the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements
in, the State of South Carolina.

With respect to the opinions set forth in
paragraphs 7 and 8 above, with your permission we have
relied upon, and this opinion is limited by, the
assumptions set forth in the discussion entitled
"Certain South Carolina Taxes" in the Prospectus
forming part of Registration Statement No. 33-51623,
as amended (the "Registration Statement") for the
registration of the Pass Through Certificates with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we
have assumed that each Pass Through Trust (as defined
in the Registration Statements) will constitute a
grantor trust under Subpart E, Part I of Subchapter J
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), and will not be classified as a corporation
or as a Partnership (as defined in Section 7701 of the
Code), and each Pass Through Trust does not otherwise
engage in business in South Carolina. We express no
opinion as to the correctness of the foregoing
assumptions and we have conducted no independent
investigation in this regard.

The opinions set forth herein are limited to
federal laws of the United States of America and laws
of South Carolina governing taxation and the banking
and trust powers of the Association. With respect to
the opinions set forth above in paragraph 2 as to the
legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability
of the Participation Agreements, the Pass Through
Trust Agreement and the Series Supplements, the
governing law of which is expressly stated to be that
of the State of New York, we have assumed with your
permission that the Participation Agreements, the Pass
Through Trust Agreement, and the Series Supplements
constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable
documents or instruments under the laws of the State
of New York (as to which assumption we express no
opinion) and those opinions are expressed as if the
laws of South Carolina were to govern those documents
or instruments. Further, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as
to (i) federal or state securities laws or blue sky
laws and assume that the Pass Through Certificates
have been registered, issued and sold in compliance
with all applicable federal and state securities and
blue sky laws and that the Pass Through Trust
Agreement and the Series Supplements have been duly
qualified under the provisions of the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended; (ii) any laws, rules or
regulations applicable to the particular nature of the
equipment acquired by the Owner Trustee except as set
forth in paragraph 1 above with respect to the
citizenship of the Pass Through Trustee; (iii) the
perfection or priority of security interests or;
ERISA.

This opinion is being furnished only to the
parties to which it is addressed and is solely for
their benefit. No other Person shall be entitled to
rely on this opinion without our express prior written
consent. This opinion may not be used, circulated,
quoted, published or otherwise referred to for any
purpose without our express prior written consent.
Our opinion is limited to the matters stated herein,
and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond
the opinions expressly stated herein.

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association, a
national banking association ("First Security"), in
connection with the Trust Agreement dated as of
September 1, 1993, as amended and restated as of March
1, 1994 (the "Trust Agreement"), between First
Security and LLG Aircraft Leasing, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (the "Owner Participant"). This
opinion is furnished pursuant to Section 4.01(k)(v) of
the Participation Agreement, dated as of March 1,
1994, (the "Participation Agreement"), among Federal
Express Corporation, as Lessee, the Owner Participant,
First Security, not in its individual capacity except
as specifically set forth therein but solely as Owner
Trustee (the "Owner Trustee") under the Trust
Agreement, NationsBank of Georgia, National
Association, as Indenture Trustee, NationsBank of
South Carolina, National Association, as Pass Through
Trustee, and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New
York Branch. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined are used as defined in or by
reference in Schedule II to the Participation
Agreement.

We have examined executed counterparts or
copies otherwise identified to our satisfaction of the
Operative Agreements (other than the Lease, the Lease
Supplement, the Trust Agreement Supplement covering
the Aircraft and the Indenture and Security Agreement
Supplement (the "Commencement Documents") the forms of
which we have examined). We have also examined
originals or copies of such other documents, such
corporate records, certificates and other statements
of governmental officials and corporate officers and
other representatives of the corporations or entities
referred to herein and such other instruments as we
have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes
of this opinion. Moreover, as to certain facts
material to the opinions expressed herein, we have
relied upon representations and warranties contained
in the Operative Agreements (other than the
Commencement Documents).

Based upon the foregoing and upon an
examination of such questions of law as we have
considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to
the assumptions, exceptions and qualifications set
forth below, we advise you that, in our opinion:

1. First Security is a national banking
association organized and validly existing
under the laws of the United States of
America holding a valid certificate to do
business as a national banking association,
with banking and trust powers, is a Citizen
of the United States as that term is defined
in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
amended, (the "Act"), and each of First
Security and the Owner Trustee, as the case
may be, has full corporate power, authority
and legal right to execute, deliver and
perform each of the Operative Agreements to
which it is or is to be a party (other than
the Certificates) and to issue, execute,
deliver and perform the Certificates.

2. Each of First Security and the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be, has duly
authorized, executed and delivered each
Operative Agreement (other than any
Commencement Document) to which it is a
party; each such document constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Owner Trustee (and, to the extent set forth
in the respective Operative Agreement, of
First Security) enforceable against the Owner
Trustee (and, to the extent set forth in the
respective Operative Agreement, against First
Security) in accordance with its terms; and
the Trust Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Owner
Participant enforceable against the Owner
Participant in accordance with its terms.
The Certificates have been duly issued,
executed and delivered by the Owner Trustee,
pursuant to authorization contained in the
Trust Agreement, and constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Owner
Trustee enforceable against the Owner Trustee
in accordance with their terms and the terms
of the Indenture; and the Certificates are
entitled to the benefits and security
afforded by the Indenture in accordance with
their terms and the terms of the Indenture.

3. On November 15, 1993, the Owner
Trustee received from Lufthansa such title to
the Aircraft as Lufthansa conveyed to the
Owner Trustee, subject to the rights of (a)
Lufthansa under the Sales Agreement, (b) DA
under the Modification Agreement and (c) the
Owner Trustee and the Lessee under the
Agreement to Lease; and to our knowledge,
there exist no Liens affecting the title of
the Owner Trustee to the Lessor's Estate
resulting from claims against First Security
not related to the ownership of the Lessor's
Estate or the administration of the Lessor's
Estate or any other transaction pursuant to
the Indenture or any document included in the
Trust Indenture Estate.

4. All the properties which are part of
the Trust Indenture Estate (but not including
those properties which are not to be part of
the Trust Indenture Estate until the Exchange
Date) have been pledged and mortgaged with
the Indenture Trustee as part of the Trust
Indenture Estate, and the beneficial interest
of the Owner Participant under the Trust
Agreement in and to such properties is
subject, to the extent provided in the
Indenture and the Collateral Agreement, to
the Lien of the Indenture in favor of the
Holders of the Certificates.

5. To the extent the Uniform Commercial
Code of the State of Utah (the "UCC") is
applicable, except for the Indenture
Trustee's taking of possession of all monies
and securities (including instruments)
constituting part of the Trust Indenture
Estate, no action, including the filing or
recording of any document, is necessary
(i) to create under the UCC the security
interest in the Trust Indenture Estate which
the Indenture by its terms purports to create
in favor of the Indenture Trustee as of the
Closing Date (the "Security Interest"), and
(ii) to perfect in the State of Utah the
Security Interest, except for the filing of a
UCC financing statement complying with the
formal requisites of Section 9-402 of the UCC
in the office of the Secretary of State of
the State of Utah with respect to the
Security Interest, which filing has been duly
effected, and the filing of continuation
statements with respect thereto required to
be filed at periodic intervals under the UCC.

6. The Trust Agreement duly creates a
legal and valid trust under Utah law, the
trust created by the Trust Agreement has been
duly created and exists for the benefit of
the Owner Participant, and the Trust
Agreement creates for the benefit of the
Owner Participant the interest in the
Lessor's Estate which the Trust Agreement by
its terms purports to create, subject,
however, to the Trust Indenture Estate acting
as security for the Certificates issued under
the Indenture, for the use and benefit of the
Holders from time to time thereof, as
provided in the Indenture and the Collateral
Agreement.

7. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Owner Trustee or First Security, as
the case may be, of the Operative Agreements,
nor the issuance, execution and delivery by
the Owner Trustee of the Certificates nor the
consummation of any of the transactions by
the Owner Trustee or First Security, as the
case may be, contemplated thereby, requires
the consent or approval of, the giving of
notice to, the registration with, or the
taking of any other action in respect of, any
governmental authority or agency of the State
of Delaware or the United States of America
governing the banking or trust powers of
First Security.

8. Assuming that the trust created by
the Trust Agreement is treated as a grantor
trust for federal income tax purposes within
the contemplation of Sections 671 through 678
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, there
are no fees, taxes, or other charges (except
taxes imposed on fees payable to the Owner
Trustee) payable to the State of Utah or any
political subdivision thereof in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance
by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
the Lessee or the Owner Participant, as the
case may be, of the Operative Agreements or
in connection with the making by the Owner
Participant of its investment in the Aircraft
or its acquisition of the beneficial interest
in the Lessor's Estate or in connection with
the issuance and acquisition of the
Certificates or the investment of Liquid
Collateral (as defined in the Collateral
Agreement) in Specified Investments (as
defined in the Collateral Agreement), and
neither the Owner Trustee, the Lessor's
Estate nor the trustee created by the Trust
Agreement will be subject to any fee, tax or
other governmental charge (except taxes on
fees payable to the Owner Trustee) under the
laws of the State of Utah or any political
subdivision thereof on, based on or measured
by, directly or indirectly, the gross
receipts, net income or value of the Lessor's
Estate by reason of the creation or continued
existence of the trust under the terms of the
Trust Agreement pursuant to the laws of the
State of Utah or the Owner Trustee's
performance of its duties under the Trust
Agreement.

9. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Owner Trustee or First
Security, as the case may be, of each of the
Operative Agreements and the issuance,
execution, delivery and performance of the
Certificates by the Owner Trustee are not in
violation of the Articles of Association or
by-laws of First Security or of any law,
governmental rule, or regulation of the State
of Utah or the United States of America
governing the banking or trust powers of
First Security or, to our knowledge, of any
indenture, mortgage, bank credit agreement,
note or bond purchase agreement, long-term
lease, license or other agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which
it is bound or, to our knowledge, or any
judgment or order of the State of Utah or the
United States of America relating to the
banking or trust powers of First Security.

10. There is no fee, tax or other
governmental charge under the laws of the
State of Utah or any political subdivision
thereof in existence on the date hereof on,
based on or measured by any payments under
the Certificates or the beneficial interests
in the Lessor's Estate, by reason of the
creation of the trust under the Trust
Agreement pursuant to the laws of the State
of Utah or the Owner Trustee's performance of
its duties under the Trust Agreement within
the State of Utah, which would not have been
imposed if First Security did not have its
principal place of business and did not
perform its obligations under the Operative
Agreements in the State of Utah.

11. Neither a Utah Court nor a Federal
Court applying Utah law, if properly
presented with the issue and after having
properly considered such issue, would permit
the Owner Participant to terminate the Trust
Agreement, except in accordance with its
terms or with the consent of the Indenture
Trustee, so long as the Lien of the Indenture
on the Trust Indenture Estate has not been
released or payment of the principal of, and
premium, if any, and interest on, the
Certificates has not been made in full.
Under the laws of the State of Utah, so long
as the Trust Agreement has not been
terminated in accordance with its terms or
with the consent of the Indenture Trustee,
creditors of any person that is an Owner
Participant, holders of a Lien against the
assets of any such person and representatives
of creditors of any such person, such as
trustees, receivers or liquidators (whether
or not an insolvency proceeding has been
commenced) (collectively, the "Creditors")
may acquire valid claims and liens, as to the
Lessor's Estate, only against the rights of
such Owner Participant under the Trust
Agreement or in the Lessor's Estate, and do
not have, and may not through the enforcement
of such Creditors' rights acquire, any
greater rights than such Owner Participant
with respect to the Trust Agreement or the
Lessor's Estate.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the
following assumptions, exceptions and qualifications:

A. The foregoing opinions are limited to
the laws of the State of Utah and the federal laws of
the United States of America governing the banking and
trust powers of First Security. In addition, we
express no opinion with respect to (i) federal
securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended, (ii) the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
amended (except with respect to the opinion set forth
in paragraph 1 above concerning the citizenship of
First Security), or (iii) state securities or blue sky
laws. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the
validity and enforceability in Utah of the
Certificates and the other Operative Agreements
expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of
New York, we have assumed that the Certificates and
such other Operative Agreements constitute legal,
valid, binding and enforceable documents or
instruments under such laws (as to which we express no
opinion).

B. The foregoing opinions regarding
enforceability of any document or instrument are
subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, receivership and similar
laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally, and (ii) general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

C. We have assumed the due authorization,
execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto,
other than First Security and the Owner Trustee, of
the Operative Agreements to which each is a party and
that each of such parties has the full power,
authority and legal right to execute and deliver each
such document.

D. The opinion set forth in paragraph 1
above concerning the citizenship of First Security is
based upon facts contained in an affidavit of First
Security, made by its _____________, the facts set
forth in which we have not independently verified.

E. We have assumed the due authentication
of the Certificates by the Indenture Trustee.

F. We have assumed that all signatures on
documents and instruments examined by us are genuine,
that all documents and instruments submitted to us as
originals are authentic, and that all documents and
instruments submitted to us as copies conform with the
originals, which facts we have not independently
verified.

G. We do not purport to be experts in
respect of, or express any opinion concerning,
aviation law or other laws, rules or regulations
applicable to the particular nature of the equipment
to be acquired by the Owner Trustee.

H. We have made no investigation of, and,
except as expressly provided in paragraph 3 above, we
express no opinion concerning, the nature of the title
to any part of the Lessor's Estate or the priority of
any mortgage or security interest.

I. We have assumed that the Participation
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
are not within the prohibitions of Section 406 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

J. The opinions expressed in paragraph 11
are subject to principles of equity.

This opinion is rendered solely for your
benefit and may not be furnished or quoted to or
relied upon by any other person or entity for any
purpose without our prior written consent, except that
the law firm of David Polk & Wardwell may rely on this
opinion in connection with the rendering of its
opinion dated the date hereof in connection with the
financing described herein.

We rendered an opinion dated September 1,
1993 (the "Agreement to Lease Opinion"), a copy of
which is attached hereto. We hereby consent and agree
that the addressees hereto who were not addressees to
the Agreement to Lease Opinion may rely on the
Agreement to Lease Opinion as fully and with the same
force and effect as if such addressees were originally
named therein on the date of the Agreement to Lease
Opinion.

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to First
Security Bank of Utah, National Association, a
national banking association ("First Security"), in
connection with the Trust Agreement dated as of
September 1, 1993, as amended and restated as of March
1, 1994 (the "Trust Agreement"), between First
Security and LLG Aircraft Leasing, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (the "Owner Participant"). This
opinion is furnished pursuant to Section 4.02(j)(iv)
and Section 4.03(l)(v) of the Participation Agreement,
dated as of March 1, 1994, (the "Participation
Agreement"), among Federal Express Corporation, as
Lessee, the Owner Participant, First Security, not in
its individual capacity except as specifically set
forth therein but solely as Owner Trustee (the "Owner
Trustee") under the Trust Agreement, NationsBank of
Georgia, National Association, as Indenture Trustee,
NationsBank of South Carolina, National Association,
as Pass Through Trustee, and Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, New York Branch. Capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined are used as defined
in or by reference in Schedule II to the Participation
Agreement.

We have examined executed counterparts or
copies otherwise identified to our satisfaction of the
Operative Agreements ((other than the Indenture and
Security Agreement Supplement, the form of which we

or copies of such other documents, such corporate
records, certificates and other statements of
governmental officials and corporate officers and
other representatives of the corporations or entities
referred to herein and such other instruments as we
have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes
of this opinion. Moreover, as to certain facts
material to the opinions expressed herein, we have
relied upon representations and warranties contained
in the Operative Agreements.

Based upon the foregoing and upon an
examination of such questions of law as we have
considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to
the assumptions, exceptions and qualifications set
forth below, we advise you that, in our opinion:

1. First Security is a national banking
association organized and validly existing
under the laws of the United States of
America holding a valid certificate to do
business as a national banking association,
with banking and trust powers, is a Citizen
of the United States as that term is defined

thereof, full corporate power, authority and
legal right to execute, deliver and perform
each of the Operative Agreements to which it
is a party (other than the Certificates) and
to issue, execute, deliver and perform the
Certificates.

2. Each of First Security and the Owner
Trustee, as the case may be, has duly
authorized, executed and delivered each
Operative Agreement ((other than the

- -----------

Indenture and Security Agreement
Supplement))* to which it is a party; each
such document constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Owner Trustee (and,
to the extent set forth in the respective
Operative Agreement, of First Security)
enforceable against the Owner Trustee (and,
to the extent set forth in the respective
Operative Agreement, against First Security)
in accordance with its terms; and the Trust
Agreement, as supplemented by the Trust
Agreement Supplement covering the Aircraft,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Owner Participant
enforceable against the Owner Participant in
accordance with its terms. The Certificates
have been duly issued, executed and delivered
by the Owner Trustee, pursuant to
authorization contained in the Trust
Agreement, and constitute the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Owner Trustee
enforceable against the Owner Trustee in
accordance with their terms and the terms of
the Indenture; and the Certificates are
entitled to the benefits and security
afforded by the Indenture in accordance with
their terms and the terms of the Indenture.

3. On November 15, 1993, the Owner
Trustee received from Lufthansa such title to
the Aircraft as Lufthansa conveyed to the
Owner Trustee, subject to the rights of (a)
Lufthansa under the Sales Agreement, (b) DA
under the Modification Agreement and (c) the
Owner Trustee and the Lessee under the
Agreement to Lease; and to our knowledge,
there exist no Liens affecting the title of
the Owner Trustee to the Lessor's Estate
resulting from claims against First Security
not related to the ownership of the Lessor's
Estate or the administration of the Lessor's
Estate or any other transaction pursuant to
the Indenture or any document included in the
Trust Indenture Estate.

beneficial interest of the Owner Participant
under the Trust Agreement in and to such
properties is subject, to the extent provided
in the Indenture and the Collateral
Agreement, to the Lien of the Indenture in
favor of the Holders of the
Certificates.)*

(5. To the extent the Uniform Commercial

applicable, except for the Indenture
Trustee's taking of possession of all monies
and securities (including instruments)
constituting part of the Trust Indenture
Estate, no action, including the filing or

(i) to create under the UCC the security

Interest"), and (ii) to perfect in the State
of Utah the Security Interest, except for the
filing of a UCC financing statement complying
with the formal requisites of Section 9-402
of the UCC in the office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Utah with respect to

Date opinion only.

not occur on the Commencement Date, this
paragraph need be provided in the Exchange
Date opinion only.

6. The Trust Agreement, as supplemented
by the Trust Agreement Supplement covering
the Aircraft, duly creates a legal and valid
trust under Utah law, the trust created by
the Trust Agreement, as so supplemented, has
been duly created and exists for the benefit
of the Owner Participant, and the Trust
Agreement, as so supplemented, creates for
the benefit of the Owner Participant the
interest in the Lessor's Estate which the
Trust Agreement, as so supplemented, by its
terms purports to create, subject, however,
to the Trust Indenture Estate acting as
security for the Certificates issued under
the Indenture, for the use and benefit of the
Holders from time to time thereof, as
provided in the Indenture and the Collateral
Agreement.

7. Neither the execution and delivery

the case may be, of the Operative Agreements
((other than the Indenture and Security
Agreement Supplement))*, nor the issuance,
execution and delivery by the Owner Trustee
of the Certificates nor the consummation of

consent or approval of, the giving of notice
to, the registration with, or the taking of
any other action in respect of, any
governmental authority or agency of the State
of Delaware or the United States of America
governing the banking or trust powers of
First Security.

8. Assuming that the trust created by
the Trust Agreement, as supplemented by the
Trust Agreement Supplement covering the
Aircraft, is treated as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes within the
contemplation of Sections 671 through 678 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, there are

no fees, taxes, or other charges (except
taxes imposed on fees payable to the Owner
Trustee) payable to the State of Utah or any

with the execution, delivery or performance
by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,

case may be, of the Operative Agreements
((other than the Indenture and Security

with the making by the Owner Participant of
its investment in the Aircraft or its
acquisition of the beneficial interest in the
Lessor's Estate or in connection with the
issuance and acquisition of the Certificates
or the investment of Liquid Collateral (as
defined in the Collateral Agreement) in
Specified Investments (as defined in the
Collateral Agreement), and neither the Owner
Trustee, the Lessor's Estate nor the trustee
created by the Trust Agreement, as so
supplemented, will be subject to any fee, tax
or other governmental charge (except taxes on
fees payable to the Owner Trustee) under the
laws of the State of Utah or any political
subdivision thereof on, based on or measured
by, directly or indirectly, the gross
receipts, net income or value of the Lessor's
Estate by reason of the creation or continued
existence of the trust under the terms of the
Trust Agreement, as so supplemented, pursuant
to the laws of the State of Utah or the Owner

the United States of America governing the

Indenture Estate has not been released or
payment of the principal of, and premium, if
any, and interest on, the Certificates has

Participant, holders of a Lien against the
assets of any such person and representatives
of creditors of any such person, such as
trustees, receivers or liquidators (whether
or not an insolvency proceeding has been
commenced) (collectively, the "Creditors")
may acquire valid claims and liens, as to the
Lessor's Estate, only against the rights of
such Owner Participant under the Trust
Agreement, as so supplemented, or in the
Lessor's Estate, and do not have, and may not
through the enforcement of such Creditors'
rights acquire, any greater rights than such
Owner Participant with respect to the Trust
Agreement, as so supplemented, or the
Lessor's Estate.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the
following assumptions, exceptions and qualifications:

A. The foregoing opinions are limited to
the laws of the State of Utah and the federal laws of
the United States of America governing the banking and
trust powers of First Security. In addition, we
express no opinion with respect to (i) federal
securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended, (ii) the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
amended (except with respect to the opinion set forth
in paragraph 1 above concerning the citizenship of
First Security), or (iii) state securities or blue sky
laws. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the
validity and enforceability in Utah of the
Certificates and the other Operative Agreements
expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of
New York, we have assumed that the Certificates and
such other Operative Agreements constitute legal,
valid, binding and enforceable documents or
instruments under such laws (as to which we express no
opinion).

B. The foregoing opinions regarding
enforceability of any document or instrument are
subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, receivership and similar
laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally, and (ii) general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

C. We have assumed the due authorization,
execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto,
other than First Security and the Owner Trustee, of
the Operative Agreements to which each is a party and
that each of such parties has the full power,
authority and legal right to execute and deliver each
such document.

D. The opinion set forth in paragraph 1
above concerning the citizenship of First Security is
based upon facts contained in an affidavit of First
Security, made by its ____________, the facts set
forth in which we have not independently verified.

E. We have assumed the due authentication
of the Certificates by the Indenture Trustee.

F. We have assumed that all signatures on
documents and instruments examined by us are genuine,
that all documents and instruments submitted to us as
originals are authentic, and that all documents and
instruments submitted to us as copies conform with the
originals, which facts we have not independently
verified.

G. We do not purport to be experts in
respect of, or express any opinion concerning,
aviation law or other laws, rules or regulations
applicable to the particular nature of the equipment
to be acquired by the Owner Trustee.

H. We have made no investigation of, and,
except as expressly provided in paragraph 3 above, we
express no opinion concerning, the nature of the title
to any part of the Lessor's Estate or the priority of
any mortgage or security interest.

I. We have assumed that the Participation
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
are not within the prohibitions of Section 406 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

J. The opinions expressed in paragraph 11
are subject to principles of equity.

This opinion is rendered solely for your
benefit and may not be furnished or quoted to or
relied upon by any other person or entity for any
purpose without our prior written consent, except that
the law firm of David Polk & Wardwell may rely on this
opinion in connection with the rendering of its
opinion dated the date hereof in connection with the
financing described herein.

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel for Federal
Express Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Federal
Express"), in connection with the transaction
contemplated by the Participation Agreement (Federal
Express Corporation Trust ______), dated as of March
1, 1994, (the "Participation Agreement"), among
Federal Express, as Lessee, LLG Aircraft Leasing,
L.P., as Owner Participant, First Security Bank of
Utah, National Association, as Owner Trustee,
NationsBank of Georgia, National Association, as
Indenture Trustee, NationsBank of South Carolina, as
Pass Through Trustee, and Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, New York Branch, as LC Bank. Unless
otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used
herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in
Schedule II to the Participation Agreement.
References herein to "Commencement Documents" are to
the Lease, any Lease Supplement, the Trust Agreement
Supplement covering the Aircraft, any Indenture and
Security Agreement Supplement and any other Operative
Agreement not required to be executed on or prior to
the Closing Date. References herein to the "Pre-
Funding Documents" are to the Collateral Agreement,
the Demand Notes and the Letter of Credit. This
opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section
4.01(k)(vii) of the Participation Agreement.

The Participation Agreement provides, among
other things, for the financing of the Owner Trustee's
payment of the Purchase Price, Modification Cost,
Parts Cost and related expenses with respect to the
Aircraft using the proceeds from the public offering
of Pass Through Certificates. Three Series of Pass
Through Certificates will be issued by separate Pass
Through Trusts, each formed to acquire, among other
securities, the Certificates bearing a particular
interest rate and having a particular maturity that
will be issued under the Indenture.

In connection with the opinions expressed
below, we have examined the Participation Agreement,
the Original Trust Agreement, the form of Trust
Agreement Supplement, the form of Lease and Lease
Supplement, the Indenture, the form of Indenture and
Security Agreement Supplement, the Collateral
Agreement, the Sales Agreement, the Agreement to
Lease, the Modification Agreement, the Parts and
Services Agreement, the Certificates, the Pass Through
Certificates, the Pass Through Agreement and each
Series Supplement. We have also examined originals,
or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such other
agreements, documents, certificates and statements of
governmental officials and corporate officers as we
have deemed necessary or advisable as a basis for such
opinions. In examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of
all documents submitted to us as originals and the
conformity with the originals of all documents
submitted to us as copies.

As to any facts material to our opinions
expressed below, we have, with your consent, relied on
the representations and warranties made in or
pursuant to the Participation Agreement and the other
documents referred to therein, the accuracy of which
we have not independently verified. In addition, we
have, when relevant facts were not independently
established by us, relied, to the extent we deemed
such reliance proper, upon certificates of public
officials and certificates, telegrams and other
written or oral statements of officers of the parties
referred to herein.

Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion
that:

1. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Owner Trustee, in its individual or trust
capacity, as the case may be, of the Operative
Agreements (other than the Certificates, the
Commencement Documents, the Sales Agreement and
the Pre-Funding Documents) to which it is a
party, and the issuance, execution, delivery and
performance of the Certificates by the Owner
Trustee in its trust capacity do not, or did not
on the date of execution thereof, violate, and
fully comply, or did fully comply on the date of
execution thereof, with, any laws and
governmental rules and regulations of the State
of New York that may be applicable to the Owner
Trustee in its individual or trust capacity, as
the case may be. The opinion set forth in this
paragraph 1 is rendered without regard to the
effect, if any, on such issuance (in the case of
the Certificates), execution, delivery,
performance of the taking of any other action,
the conduct of any other business or the exercise
of any other powers by First Security Bank of
Utah, National Association in its individual or
in a trust capacity in the State of New York not
related to the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Agreements.

2. The execution, delivery and performance
of the Participation Agreement, the Pass Through
Agreement and each Series Supplement by the Pass
Through Trustee in its individual or trust
capacity, as the case may be, and the issuance,
execution, delivery and performance of the Pass
Through Certificates by the Pass Through Trustee
in its trust capacity do not contravene any laws
and governmental rules and regulations of the
State of New York that may be applicable to the
Pass Through Trustee in its individual or trust
capacity, as the case may be. The opinion set
forth in this paragraph 2 is rendered without
regard to the effect, if any, on such issuance
(in the case of the Pass Through Certificates),
execution, delivery or performance of the taking
of any other action, the conduct of any other
business or the exercise of any other powers by
NationsBank of South Carolina, National
Association, in its individual or in a trust
capacity in the State of New York not related to
the transactions contemplated by the Operative
Agreements.

3. (a) Each of the Pass Through Agreement,
the Series Supplements and the other Operative
Agreements to which Federal Express is or is to
be a party has been duly authorized by Federal
Express. Each of the Pass Through Agreement, the
Series Supplements and the other Operative
Agreements (other than the Commencement
Documents) to which Federal Express is a party
has been duly executed and delivered by Federal
Express.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance
of each of the Pass Through Agreement, the Series
Supplements and the other Operative Agreements to
which Federal Express is or is to be a party do
not violate, and fully comply with, any laws and
governmental rules and regulations of the State
of New York that may be applicable to Federal
Express. The opinion set forth in this paragraph
3(b) is rendered without regard to the taking of
any other action or the conduct of any other
business by Federal Express in the State of New
York not related to the transactions contemplated
by the Operative Agreements.

4. Assuming (i) the due authorization,
execution and delivery of the Pass Through
Agreement, each Series Supplement and each other
Operative Agreement by each of the parties to
each such document (other than Federal Express),
(ii) the due authorization, execution, issue and
delivery by the Owner Trustee, and the due
authentication by the Indenture Trustee, of the
Certificates to be issued under the Indenture in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (iii)
the due authorization, execution, issuance,
delivery and authentication by the Pass Through
Trustee of the Pass Through Certificates to be
issued under the Pass Through Agreement and the
Series Supplement relating to such Pass Through
Certificates, in each case in accordance with the
terms of the Pass Through Agreement and such
Series Supplement, and (iv) that the form of each
such document is in compliance with all
applicable laws and governmental rules and
regulations (other than Federal laws and the laws
of the State of New York) then: (A) each such
document (other than the Commencement Documents,
the Sales Agreement and the Pre-Funding
Documents) constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of each party thereto enforceable
against each such party in accordance with its
terms; (B) the Indenture creates, for the benefit
of the Holders, the security interest in the
Trust Indenture Estate that it purports to create
as of the Closing Date, except that no opinion is
given with respect to perfection of such security
interest on the date hereof; (C) the
Certificates, when issued to and acquired by the
Pass Through Trustee, will be legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Owner Trustee
enforceable against the Owner Trustee in
accordance with their terms and the terms of the
Indenture and will be entitled to the benefits of
the Indenture, including the benefit of the
security interest created thereby, except that no
opinion is given with respect to the perfection
of such security interest on the date hereof; (D)
the Pass Through Certificates, when issued to and
acquired by the Underwriters in accordance with
the Underwriting Agreement, will be legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Pass Through
Trustee enforceable against the Pass Through
Trustee in accordance with their terms and will
be entitled to the benefits of the Pass Through
Agreement and the Series Supplement relating
thereto; and (E) the beneficial interest of the
Owner Participant under the Trust Agreement in
and to the properties which are part of the Trust
Indenture Estate is subject, to the extent
provided in the Indenture, to the Lien of the
Indenture in favor of the Holders.

5. Federal Express's participation in the
transactions contemplated by the Operative
Agreements does not and will not constitute a
violation of Section 7 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

6. It is not necessary, in connection with
the creation of the beneficial interest of the
Owner Participant in the Trust Indenture Estate
under the circumstances contemplated by the
Participation Agreement to register such
beneficial interest under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or to qualify the Trust
Agreement under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended.

7. On the Commencement Date, the provisions
of Section 1110 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code will be applicable to the Aircraft for the
benefit of the Lessor, as lessor under and by
reason of the Lease. Upon assignment of the
Lease as provided for in the Indenture upon the
Exchange Date, the aforesaid rights under Section
1110 will have been assigned to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture as part of the
collateral for the Certificates.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the
following qualifications:

(a) For purposes of the matters stated in
paragraph 3(a) above and as to matters of
Tennessee law, we have relied on the opinion
dated the date hereof of Kenneth R. Masterson,
Senior Vice President and General Counsel
of the Lessee. Such Opinion is satisfactory to
to us in form and scope and we believe that you
and we are justified in relying thereon.

(b) For the purposes of the opinion provided
in paragraph 7 above, (i) we have assumed that
there will be no change in any applicable law on
or prior to the Commencement Date or Exchange
Date as of which such opinion speaks; (ii) we
have assumed that there will be no amendments or
modifications to the forms of the Lease or Lease
Supplement (other than the insertion of
information as provided for; and (iii) as to
matters of fact relevant to such opinion we have
relied without independent investigation on the
conclusions relating to the Aircraft expressed in
the appraisal as of the date hereof by BK
Associates, Inc.

(c) We are qualified to practice law in the
State of New York, and we do not purport to be
experts on, or to express any opinion herein
concerning, any laws other than the laws of the
State of New York and the laws of the United
States and the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware.

(d) The opinion as to enforceability
contained in paragraph 4 above is subject, as to
enforceability of rights and remedies, to
(i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) recognized equitable
principles which may affect the remedies provided
in the agreements referred to in said opinions,
which laws and principles, however, do not in our
opinion make the remedies provided in said
agreements inadequate for the practical
realization of the benefits of the security
intended to be provided thereby.

(e) This opinion is rendered solely to you
at Federal Express's request in connection with
the above matter. This opinion may not be relied
upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon
by or furnished to any other person, other than
your successors and permitted assigns, without
our prior written consent.

(f) We rendered an opinion dated September
1, 1993 (the "Agreement to Lease Opinion"), a
copy of which is attached hereto. We hereby
consent and agree that the addressees hereto who
were not addressees to the Agreement to Lease
Opinion may rely on the Agreement to Lease
Opinion as fully and with the same force and
effect as if such addressees were originally
named therein on the date of the Agreement to
Lease Opinion.

Re: Federal Express Corporation Trust

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel for Federal
Express Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Federal
Express"), in connection with the transaction
contemplated by the Participation Agreement (Federal
Express Corporation Trust ______), dated as of March
1, 1994 (the "Participation Agreement"), among Federal
Express, as Lessee, LLG Aircraft Leasing, L.P., as
Owner Participant, First Security Bank of Utah,
National Association, as Owner Trustee, NationsBank of
Georgia, National Association, as Indenture Trustee,
NationsBank of South Carolina, as Pass Through
Trustee, and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New
York Branch. Unless otherwise defined herein,
capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings
assigned thereto in Schedule II to the Participation
Agreement. This opinion is being delivered pursuant
to Section 4.02(j)(v) and Section 4.03(l)(vi) of the
Participation Agreement.

The Participation Agreement provides, among
other things, for the financing of the Owner Trustee's
payment of the Purchase Price, Modification Cost,
Parts Cost and related expenses with respect to the
Aircraft using the proceeds from the public offering
of Pass Through Certificates. Two Series of Pass
Through Certificates have been issued by separate Pass
Through Trusts, each formed to acquire, among other
securities, the Certificates bearing a particular
interest rate and having a particular maturity issued
under the Indenture.

- ------------
* If the Exchange Date does not occur on the
Commencement Date a separate opinion, dated
the Exchange Date, shall be provided as to
all matters below, except as otherwise
specified.

In connection with the opinions expressed
below, we have examined the Participation Agreement,
the Original Trust Agreement, the Trust Agreement
Supplement covering the Aircraft, the Lease and Lease
Supplement, the Indenture, the (form of)* Indenture
and Security Agreement Supplement, the Collateral
Agreement, the Sales Agreement, the Agreement to
Lease, the Modification Agreement, the Parts and
Services Agreement, the Certificates, the Pass Through
Certificates, the Pass Through Agreement and each
Series Supplement. We have also examined originals,
or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such other
agreements, documents, certificates and statements of
governmental officials and corporate officers as we
have deemed necessary or advisable as a basis for such
opinions. In examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of
all documents submitted to us as originals and the
conformity with the originals of all documents
submitted to us as copies.

As to any facts material to our opinions
expressed below, we have, with your consent, relied on
the representations and warranties made in or
pursuant to the Participation Agreement and the other
documents referred to therein, the accuracy of which
we have not independently verified. In addition, we
have, when relevant facts were not independently
established by us, relied, to the extent we deemed
such reliance proper, upon certificates of public
officials and certificates, telegrams and other
written or oral statements of officers of the parties
referred to herein.

Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion
that:

1. With respect to that portion, if any, of
the Aircraft and the other property included in
the Lessor's Estate as may not be covered by the
recording system established by the Federal
Aviation Administration (the "FAA") pursuant to
Section 503(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of
1958, as amended the "Act"), no filing or
recording of any document or other action was or

is necessary in order to establish the Owner
Trustee's title thereto and interest therein as
against Federal Express and any third parties.

(2. The Lease creates a valid leasehold
interest in the Aircraft, the entitlement thereof
to the benefits of recordation under the Act
being subject to the due and timely filing for
recording of (A) the Lease(, with the Indenture
(as supplemented by the Indenture and Security
Agreement Supplement) attached as an exhibit, (B)
the Indenture)* and ((B)/(C)) the Trust
Agreement as supplemented by the Trust Agreement
Supplement covering the Aircraft.)*

(3. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Owner Trustee, in its individual or trust
capacity, as the case may be, of the Operative
Agreements (other than the Certificates, the
Sales Agreement and the Collateral Agreement) to
which it is a party, and the issuance, execution,
delivery and performance of the Certificates by
the Owner Trustee in its trust capacity do not,
or did not as of the date of execution thereof,
violate, and fully comply, or did fully comply as
of the date of execution thereof, with, any laws
and governmental rules and regulations of the
State of New York that may be applicable to the
Owner Trustee in its individual or trust
capacity, as the case may be. The opinion set
forth in this paragraph 3 is rendered without
regard to the effect, if any, on such issuance
(in the case of the Certificates), execution,
delivery, performance of the taking of any other
action, the conduct of any other business or the
exercise of any other powers by First Security
Bank of Utah, National Association in its
individual or in a trust capacity in the State of

by the Owner Trustee, and the due authentication
by the Indenture Trustee, of the Certificates
issued under the Indenture in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, (iii) the due

Pass Through Agreement and such Series
Supplement, and (iv) that the form of each such

legal, valid and binding obligations of the Owner
Trustee enforceable against the Owner Trustee in

Participant under the Trust Agreement, as

set forth in this paragraph 5 are subject to the
due recording with the FAA of the Indenture, the

4.03(f) of the Participation Agreement and (b) at
the time of the recording of the Indenture and
Security Agreement Supplement covering the
Aircraft, to the absence of any mortgages, liens,
security interests, charges or other encumbrances
in or upon the property covered by the Indenture
and Security Agreement Supplement).)*

(7. The Indenture creates, as security for
all of the Certificates duly issued and to be
issued under the Indenture, the first priority
security interest in the Aircraft it purports to
create, the perfection and rank thereof being
subject to the registration with the FAA of the
Aircraft in the name of the Owner Trustee and the
due and timely filing for recording in accordance
with the Act of the documents referred to in
paragraph 2 above. We express no opinion
pursuant to this paragraph with respect to the
status of any security interest in any portion of
the Aircraft which does not constitute an
"aircraft" or "aircraft engine", as defined in
paragraphs (5) and (6) of Section 101 of the
Aviation Act.)*

8. Federal Express's participation in the
transactions contemplated by the Operative
Agreements does not and will not constitute a
violation of Section 7 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

(9. The provisions of Section 1110 of the

ATTACHED HERETO.

Re: Letters of Credit Nos. (LIST ALL 13)
collectively, the "Letters of Credit")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We, the undersigned, are members of the Central
Legal Department of Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale ("WestLB") and have advised WestLB and
its New York Branch (the "Branch") in connection with
the Letters of Credit referenced above, each dated as
of the date of this opinion. Capitalized terms herein
which are undefined have the meanings assigned to them
in the Letters of Credit.

In connection with the opinions hereinafter
given, we have examined a copy of (a) the Letters of
Credit, (b) each Participation Agreement (as defined
in each of the Letters of Credit, collectively, the
"Participation Agreements" and (c) each Indemnification
Agreement (as defined in each of the Participation
Agreements, together with the Letters of Credit and
Participation Agreements, the "Agreements"), and such
other certificates, documents, agreements and instruments
as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below.

In such examination, we have assumed the
genuiness of all signatures, the authenticity of all
agreements, certificates, instruments and documents
submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to
the originals of all agreements, certificates,
instruments and documents submitted to us as copies.
As to questions of fact material to the opinions
expressed below, we have, when relevant facts were not
independently established by us, examined and relied
upon representations of officers of WestLB.

Based upon the foregoing examination and
assumptions, and subject to the qualifications set
forth below, we are of the opinion that:

1) WestLB is duly organized and validly existing
as a German public law banking institution
under the law of the State of North Rhine-
Westphalia and has full power and authority
(corporate and otherwise) to execute, deliver
and perform each of the Agreements.

2) Any two of Sharon M. Maharg, Carmen Rances,
Donald F. Wolf, August Kumbier and Horst
Fuellenkemper, if acting jointly for and on
behalf of the Branch, are duly authorized by
WestLB to execute and deliver the Agreements
for and on behalf of the Branch. Assuming
the Agreements have been duly executed and
delivered for and on behalf of the Branch by
any two of such aforementioned persons acting
jointly, no further authorization by or any
corporate action of WestLB (including the
Branch) is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of the
Agreements.

3) (i) The governing law clause of each Letter
of Credit, subjecting such Letter of Credit
to the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits (revision effective
January 1, 1994) International Chamber of
Commerce Publication No. 500, and, as to
matters not covered therein, to New York law,
is valid under German law. The governing law
clause of each other Agreement subjecting
such Agreement to New York law, is valid
under German law.

(ii) Under German law, New York law will be
applied to an agreement such as the
Agreements, which under German law has been
validly subjected to New York law, except to
the extent that (a) any of the terms of such
agreement or any of the provisions of New
York law applicable to such agreement are
obviously irreconcilable with important
principles of German law, (b) there are
mandatory provisions of German law which must
be applied to the transaction covered by such
agreement irrespective of the law which
governs such agreement or (c) all elements of
the transaction covered by such agreement,
other than the choice of law, are connected
with only one country at the time of the
choice of law and there are mandatory
provisions of the law of such country
applicable to such transaction.

(iii) (a) None of the terms of the
Agreements is irreconcilable with important
principles of German law, (b) there are no
mandatory provisions of German law which must
be applied to the transactions covered by the
Agreements irrespective of the law which
governs the Agreements and (c) the
transactions covered by the Agreements were
not connected with only one country at the
time the choice of law was made.

(iv) Each Agreement is enforceable against
WestLB in accordance with its terms and,
subject to the opinion contained in paragraph
(3)(i) through (iii), the applicable
provisions of the chosen law of New York.

4) No authorization, consent, approval or other
action by, and no notice to or filing with,
any governmental, administrative or other
authority or court of Germany or of the State
of North Rhine-Westphalia is required for the
execution or delivery of any Agreement by
WestLB through the Branch or for the
performance by WestLB or by the Branch of any
Agreement.

5) The execution, delivery and performance of
the Agreements by WestLB or the Branch will
not result in any violation by WestLB or by
the Branch of any law of Germany or the State
of North Rhine-Westphalia.

6) The contractual obligations incurred by
virtue of the execution and delivery of the
Agreements for and on behalf of the Branch
are the obligations of WestLB, and WestLB has
no defenses against the performance of such
obligations which are based on the fact that
WestLB had acted through the Branch in
executing and delivering the Agreements.

7) Any final and conclusive judgment of a court
of the State of New York, New York County, or
of the United States District Court for the
Souther District of New York for a definite
sum for the recovery of the amounts due and
unpaid under the Agreements will be held
enforceable against WestLB in the appropriate
courts of Germany without re-examination or
re-litigation of the matters adjudicated,
except that such judgment is not so
enforceable if any of the reasons for
excluding enforceability set forth in Section
328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure
is present, in particular (i) under the law
of Germany said New York or federal court
does not have jurisdiction, (ii) WestLB has
not been served with process in a proper and
timely fashion and therefore WestLB has not
been able to defend itself against the claim
in the court, (iii) the judgment conflicts
with a prior judgment of a court of Germany
or a prior judgment of a foreign court that
is to be recognized in Germany, or the
litigation resulting in the judgment to be
enforced conflicts with litigation previously
commenced in Germany, (iv) recognition of the
judgment would be contrary to basic
principles of the law of Germany, in
particular but not limited to the
constitutional human rights, or (v)
reciprocity is not insured.

With respect to the condition set forth in
clause (v), reciprocity exists today with
respect to the recognition of final and
conclusive judgments of the courts of Germany
by the relevant courts of the State of New
York or the United States of America located
within the County of New York, State of New
York, as the case may be.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the
following qualifications:

(i) The opinion in paragraph (3)(iv) is subject
to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
liquidation or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, as the same may
be applied in the event of a bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or
similar situation involving WestLB.

(ii) In giving the opinions in paragraphs
(3)(iv) and (6), we have assumed, with
your consent, that the Agreements are
legal, valid, binding and enforceable
under New York law, all as set forth
more fully in the opinion dated the date
of this opinion of Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley & McCloy, issued in connection
with the Agreements.

(iii) No opinion is expressed with respect to
the law of any jurisdiction other than
the law of Germany and the State of
North Rhine-Westphalia.

(iv) With respect to the condition set forth
in clause 7(v) above, in giving the
opinion that such reciprocity today
exists, we have, with your approval,
relied upon the opinion, dated the date
of this opinion, of Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley & McCloy, issued in connection
with the Agreements.

Very truly yours,

(Form of Opinion of Special Counsel to the LC Bank)

(CLOSING DATE)

TO EACH OF THE PARTIES
LISTED ON SCHEDULE A
ATTACHED HERETO

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special New York counsel to
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale ("WestLB"), New York
Branch (the "Branch"), in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Participation
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust ______)
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation
Agreement") among Federal Express Corporation, LLG
Aircraft Leasing, L.P., NationsBank of South Carolina,
National Association, First Security Bank of Utah,
National Association, NationsBank of Georgia, National
Association and WestLB. This opinion is delivered to
you pursuant to Section 4.01(k) of the Participation
Agreement. For convenience of reference, all
capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings attributed thereto in
the Participation Agreement.

In acting as special New York counsel to
WestLB, we participated in the drafting and
negotiation of the Letter of Credit, in the
negotiation of the Participation Agreement and the
Indemnification Agreement and assisted in the
execution and delivery of the Letter of Credit, the
Participation Agreement and the Indemnification
Agreement and the related documents and instruments.

In connection with the opinions hereinafter
given, we have examined forms of the Letter of Credit,
the Participation Agreement and the Indemnification
Agreement, as well as executed originals, or copies
certified to our satisfaction, of certificates and
other statements of public officials, or officers and
representatives of WestLB and of other persons, and
such agreements, instruments and documents as we have
deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact
material to such opinions, we have, when relevant
facts were not independently established by us, relied
upon the documents we have examined or upon
certificates of the Branch of its officers or of
public officials or other persons. In our examination
of the documents referred to above we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of
documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity
with the originals of all documents submitted to us as
copies, the authenticity of the originals of such
latter documents and (except with respect to the
Branch in the case of the Letter of Credit, the
Participation Agreement and the Indemnification
Agreement) the due execution and delivery of each
such document by the parties thereto and, in the
case of the Participation Agreement and the
Indemnfication Agreement, that each such document
is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each
party thereto other than the Branch.

Based on the foregoing and on review of such
other matters as we consider necessary or appropriate
for purposes of this opinion, and having regard to
legal considerations we deem relevant and subject to
the comments and qualifications set forth below, we
are of the opinion that:

1. WestLB is licensed by the
Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York
(the "Superintendent") to maintain a branch at
1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York,
in accordance with the provisions of Article V of
the Banking Law of the State of New York (the
"Banking Law"), and the Branch has the full
power, authority and legal right under the laws
of the State of New York to execute, deliver and
perform the Participation Agreement and the
Indemnification Agreement and to issue and
perform the Letter of Credit.

2. The Letter of Credit has been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Branch, and neither the execution
and delivery thereof nor its performance of any
of the terms and provisions thereof will violate
any United States Federal banking law or
regulation applicable to it.

3. The Letter of Credit has been duly
executed and delivered by the Branch, and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of WestLB, enforceable in accordance
with its terms except as limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
and equitable principals of general application
to or affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally from time to time in effect, as
the same may be applied in the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation or similar situation involving
WestLB.

4. If any judgment against WestLB or the Branch
which is final, conclusive, enforceable in, and rendered
by a court of a competent jurisdiction in the
Federal Republic of Germany (a "German
Judgment"), in respect of any suit, action or
proceeding against WestLB for the enforcement of
the Letter of Credit, such German Judgment would
be recognized and enforced by the courts of the
State of New York and the United States of
America located within the County of New York,
State of New York to the extent and in the manner
set forth in, and except as limited by, Article
53 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the
State of New York or similar common law
principles.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the
following qualifications:

(i) We express no opinion herein as to the
availability of equitable remedies, including
specific performance and injunctive relief,
against WestLB in an action to enforce the
Participation Agreement or the Letter of Credit;

(ii) In connection with the matters stated in
paragraph 3, we call your attention to Wysko
Investment Co. v. Great American Bank, 131 Bankr.
146 (D. Ariz. 1991), which holds that a
bankruptcy court may enjoin payment under a
letter of credit pursuant to Section 105 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. section105, in unusual
circumstances. Id. at 147. In that case, the
unusual circumstance was a bankruptcy court
finding that the injunction was necessary for the
reorganization. Id. at 148. In re Delaware
River Stevedores, Inc., 129 Bankr. 28 (Bkrtcy. E.D.
Pa. 1991), also suggests that "an injunction
prohibiting payment on a L/C could conceivably be
appropriate" if certain factors relating to
issuing Section 105(a) injunctions "generally
weighed in the debtor's favor". Id. at 42,
citing In re Guy C. Long, Inc., 74 Bankr. 939
(Bkrtcy. E.D. Pa. 1987). To the extent that the
rationale of Wysko Investment Co. or Delaware
River Stevedores would support the issuance of a
permanent injunction against payment under the
Letter of Credit, we are of the opinion that
those cases do not reflect a correct statement of
the law and are not controlling precedent in any
court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction outside
of Arizona or the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, as the case may be. No opinion is
expressed on whether a court exercising
bankruptcy jurisdiction might issue a temporary
restraining order or other interim relief in
order to preserve the status quo concerning the
Letter of Credit pending a review of the merits
of any request to enjoin payment under the Letter
of Credit; and

(iii) We express no opinion as to Section
16.08 of the Participation Agreement.

We are members of the Bar of the State of New
York and we do not herein intend to express any
opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than
the Federal law of the United States of America and
the law of the State of New York. We are not licensed
to practice or advise on the law of the Federal
Republic of Germany and we do not herein intend to
express any opinion as to the law of the Federal
Republic of Germany.

Insofar as (i) the full power, authority
and legal right of the Branch, (ii) the taking of
all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Branch and (iii) the obligation of WestLB for the
obligations of the Branch are dependent upon the
law of the Federal Republic of Germany, we have
relied, with your permission and without independent
investigation, exclusively on the accompanying
opinion of Messrs. Peter Foller and Klaus
Neuper, members of the Central Legal Department of
WestLB, and with respect to such matters this opinion
is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and
limitations as are therein set forth as if set forth
herein.

This opinion is furnished to you in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Participation Agreement and may not be published or
otherwise communicated by you to any other party and
referred to or relied upon for any other purpose
without our specific prior written approval in each
instances.

Supplement;

Section 503(a) of the Act), and no

the FAA (which have been duly
effected) are necessary in order to

understood that no opinion is
expressed as to the validity,

security interest and assignment

parties in respect of the Airframe

same, or any of them, are outside
the United States;)*

10. no authorization, approval, consent,

Indenture,)* the Trust Agreement
or the Trust Agreement Supplement

parties thereto of the Trust
Agreement, or the Trust Agreement
Supplement covering the Aircraft,
the Indenture, the Participation
Agreement, the FAA Bill of Sale, the
Lease and/or the performance by the
parties thereof, nor the
consummation by the parties thereto
of any of the transactions
contemplated thereby, requires the
consent or approval of, or the
giving of notice to, or the regis-
tration with, or the taking of any
other action in respect of, the FAA
except for the filings, the
recordations and the filings for
recordation specified elsewhere in
this opinion.

No opinion is expressed as to laws other than
Federal laws of the United States. In rendering this
opinion, we were subject to the accuracy of the FAA,
its employees and agents, in the filing, indexing and
recording of instruments filed with the FAA and in the
search for encumbrance cross-reference index cards for
the Engines. Further, in rendering this opinion we
are assuming the validity and enforceability of the
above described instruments under local law. Since
our examination was limited to records maintained by
the FAA, our opinion does not cover liens which are
perfected without the filing of notice thereof with
the FAA, such as federal tax liens, liens arising
under Section 1368(a) of Title 29 of the United States
Code, possessory artisan's liens, or matters of which
the parties have actual notice. In rendering this
opinion we are assuming that there are no documents
with respect to the Aircraft which have been filed for
recording under the recording system of the FAA but
have not yet been listed in the available records of
such system as having been so filed.

In rendering this opinion we have relied upon
the opinion of the Assistant Chief Counsel for the
Aeronautical Center dated _______ and have continued
to rely upon the opinion of the Assistant Chief
Counsel for the Aeronautical Center dated
_________ __, 199_, copies of which are attached
hereto.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to
Section 4.02(j)(iii) of the Participation Agreement
(Federal Express Corporation Trust No. _____) dated as
of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation Agreement") among
Federal Express Corporation, as Lessee (the "Lessee"),
LLG Aircraft Leasing, L.P., as Owner Participant (the
"Owner Participant"), Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, New York Branch (the "Loan
Participant"), First Security Bank of Utah, National
Association, as Owner Trustee (the "Owner Trustee"),
NationsBank of Georgia, National Association, as
Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"), and
NationsBank of South Carolina, National Association,
as Pass Through Trustee (the "Pass Through Trustee"),
with respect to that portion of the Federal Aviation
Act of 1958, as amended (the "Act"), relative to the
recordation of instruments and the registration of
aircraft under the Act.

The capitalized terms herein shall, unless
otherwise defined, have the same meanings given them
in the Participation Agreement or in Annex I attached
hereto.

We have examined and filed on this date with
the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") the
following described instruments at the respective
times listed below:

(a) AC Form 8050-2 Aircraft Bill of Sale dated
____________, 1994 (the "FAA Bill of Sale")
from ________________, as seller, conveying
title to the Airframe to the Owner Trustee,
which FAA Bill of Sale was filed at ____
_.m., C.S.T.;

(b) AC Form 8050-1 Aircraft Registration
Application dated __________, 1994 (the
"Aircraft Registration Application") by the
Owner Trustee as applicant, covering the
Airframe, which Aircraft Registration
Application was filed at __________ _.m.,
C.S.T.;

(c) Affidavit of the Owner Trustee dated
__________, 1994 (the "Owner Trustee
Affidavit") pursuant to Section
47.7(c)(2)(iii) of Part 47 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations, which Owner Trustee
Affidavit was filed at __________ _.m.,
C.S.T.;

(d) executed counterpart of Trust Agreement
(Federal Express Corporation Trust No. _____)
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Trust
Agreement") between the Owner Participant and
the Owner Trustee, with executed counterpart
of Trust Agreement Supplement No. 1 dated
__________, 1994 ("Trust Supplement No. 1")
between the Owner Participant and the Owner
Trustee attached thereto, which Trust
Agreement with Trust Supplement No. 1
attached was filed at ________ _.m., C.S.T.;

(e) executed counterpart of Trust Indenture and
Security Agreement (Federal Express
Corporation Trust No. _____) dated as of
March 1, 1994 (the "Trust Indenture") between
the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee,
with executed counterpart of Indenture and
Security Agreement Supplement No. 1 (Federal
Express Corporation Trust No. _____) dated
__________, 1994 (the "Trust Indenture
Supplement") by the Owner Trustee, covering
the Aircraft, attached thereto, which Trust
Indenture with the Trust Indenture Supplement
attached was filed at ________ _.m., C.S.T.;
and,

(f) executed counterpart of Lease Agreement
(Federal Express Corporation Trust No. _____)
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Lease")
between the Owner Trustee, as lessor, and the
Lessee, with executed counterparts of the
following attached thereto: (i) Lease
Supplement No. 1 (Federal Express Corporation
Trust No. _____) dated __________, 1994 (the
"Lease Supplement") between the Owner
Trustee, as lessor, and the Lessee, covering
the Aircraft; (ii) the Trust Indenture; and
(iii) the Trust Indenture Supplement, which
Lease with the foregoing attachments
(collectively, the "Lease Attachments")
attached was filed at _________ _.m., C.S.T.

The Confidential Omissions were intentionally
omitted from the FAA filing counterparts of the Lease
and the Trust Indenture as containing confidential
financial information.

Based upon our examination of the above
described instruments and of such records of the FAA
as we deemed necessary to render this opinion, it is
our opinion that:

1. the FAA Bill of Sale, the Trust Indenture
with the Trust Indenture Supplement attached
and the Lease with the Lease Attachments
attached are all in due form for recordation
by and have been duly filed for recordation
with the FAA pursuant to and in accordance
with the provisions of the Act;

2. the Aircraft Registration Application, the
Owner Trustee Affidavit and the Trust
Agreement with Trust Supplement No. 1
attached are in due form for filing and have
been duly filed with the FAA pursuant to and
in accordance with the provisions of the Act;

3. the Airframe is eligible for registration in
the name of the Owner Trustee pursuant to and
in accordance with the provisions of the Act
and the filing with the FAA of the FAA Bill
of Sale, the Aircraft Registration
Application, the Owner Trustee Affidavit, and
the Trust Agreement with Trust Supplement No.
1 attached will cause the FAA to register the
Airframe, in due course, in the name of the
Owner Trustee and pursuant thereto to issue
to the Owner Trustee an AC Form 8050-3
Certificate of Aircraft Registration covering
the Airframe, and the Airframe will be duly
registered pursuant to and in accordance with
the provisions of the Act;

4. the Owner Trustee has valid legal title to
the Airframe and the Aircraft is free and
clear of all Liens, except (i) the security
interest created by the Trust Indenture, as
supplemented by the Trust Indenture
Supplement, and (ii) the rights of the
parties under the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement;

5. the rights of the Owner Trustee and the
Lessee under the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement, with respect to the
Aircraft, are perfected;

6. the Trust Indenture, as supplemented by the
Trust Indenture Supplement, constitutes a
duly perfected first priority security
interest in the Aircraft and a duly perfected
first assignment of all the right, title and
interest of the Owner Trustee in, to and
under the Lease and the Lease Supplement
(insofar as such assignment affects an
interest covered by the recording system
established by the FAA pursuant to Section
503(a) of the Act), and no other registration
of the Airframe or filings other than filings
with the FAA (which have been duly effected)
are necessary in order to perfect in any
applicable jurisdiction in the United States
(A) the Owner Trustee's title to the Airframe
or (B) such security interest and assignment
(insofar as such assignment affects an
interest covered by the recording system
established by the FAA pursuant to Section
503(a) of the Act), it being understood that
no opinion is expressed as to the validity,
priority or enforceability of such security
interest and assignment under local law or as
against third parties in respect of the
Airframe and the Engines at a time when the
same, or any of them, are outside the United
States;

7. no authorization, approval, consent, license
or order of, or registration with, or the
giving of notice to, the FAA is required for
the valid authorization, delivery and
performance of the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement, the Trust Indenture, as
supplemented by the Trust Indenture
Supplement, or the Trust Agreement, as
supplemented by Trust Supplement No. 1,
except for such filings as are referred to
above; and,

8. neither the execution, and delivery by the
Loan Participant of the Participation
Agreement or by the Owner Participant of the
Participation Agreement or the Trust
Agreement, as supplemented by Trust
Supplement No. 1, nor other consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby by the
Loan Participant or the Owner Participant,
requires the consent or approval of, or the
giving of notice to, or the registration of,
or the taking of any other action in respect
of the FAA, except (x) the registration of
the Airframe, including the submission of the
Aircraft Registration Application, the Owner
Trustee Affidavit, the Trust Agreement and
Trust Supplement No. 1 to the FAA and (y) the
filings for recordation specified elsewhere
in this opinion.

Since the FAA records reflect that record
title to the Airframe originated with the FAA Bill of
Sale, involving a foreign vendor, our opinion as to
the status of its record title covers only that period
of time commencing with the filing of the FAA Bill of
Sale with the FAA.

No opinion is expressed as to laws other than
Federal laws of the United States. In rendering this
opinion, we were subject to the accuracy of the FAA,
its employees and agents, in the filing, indexing and
recording of instruments filed with the FAA and in the
search for encumbrance cross-reference index cards for
the Engines. Further, in rendering this opinion we
are assuming the validity and enforceability of the
above described instruments under local law. Since
our examination was limited to records maintained by
the FAA, our opinion does not cover liens which are
perfected without the filing of notice thereof with
the FAA, such as federal tax liens, arising under
Section 1368(a) of Title 29 of the United States Code,
possessory artisan's liens, or matters of which the
parties have actual notice. In rendering this opinion
we are assuming that there are no documents with
respect to the Aircraft which have been filed for
recording under the recording system of the FAA but
have not yet been listed in the available records of
such system as having been so filed.

In rendering this opinion we have relied upon
the opinion of the Assistant Chief Counsel of the
Aeronautical Center dated ____________, 1994, a copy
of which is attached hereto.

Very truly yours,

Robert M. Peregrin

The capitalized terms herein shall, unless
otherwise defined, have the same meanings given them
in the Participation Agreement or in Annex I attached
hereto.

We have examined and filed on this date with

following described instruments at the respective
times listed below:

(a) AC Form 8050-2 Aircraft Bill of Sale dated

of Trust Agreement Supplement No. 1 dated
__________, 1994 ("Trust Supplement No. 1")
between the Owner Participant and the Owner

the Aircraft, attached hereto, which Lease
with the Lease Supplement attached was filed
at ________ _.m., C.S.T.; and,

The Confidential Omissions were intentionally
omitted from the FAA filing counterpart of the Lease
as containing confidential financial information.

Based upon our examination of the above
described instruments and of such records of the FAA
as we deemed necessary to render this opinion, it is
our opinion that:

1. the FAA Bill of Sale and the Lease with the
Lease Supplement attached are in due form for
recordation by and have been duly filed for
recordation with the FAA pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of the Act;

2. the Aircraft Registration Application, the
Owner Trustee Affidavit and the Trust
Agreement with Trust Supplement No. 1
attached are in due form for filing and have
been duly filed with the FAA pursuant to and
in accordance with the provisions of the Act;

3. the Airframe is eligible for registration in
the name of the Owner Trustee pursuant to and
in accordance with the provisions of the Act
and the filing with the FAA of the FAA Bill
of Sale, the Aircraft Registration
Application, the Owner Trustee Affidavit, and
the Trust Agreement with Trust Supplement No.
1 attached will cause the FAA to register the
Airframe, in due course, in the name of the
Owner Trustee and pursuant thereto to issue
to the Owner Trustee an AC Form 8050-3
Certificate of Aircraft Registration covering
the Airframe, and the Airframe will be duly
registered pursuant to and in accordance with
the provisions of the Act;

4. the Owner Trustee has valid legal title to
the Airframe and the Aircraft is free and
clear of all Liens, except the rights of the
parties under the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement;

5. the rights of the Owner Trustee and the
Lessee under the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement, with respect to the
Aircraft, are perfected;

6. no authorization, approval, consent, license
or order of, or registration with, or the
giving of notice to, the FAA is required for
the valid authorization, delivery and
performance of the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement or the Trust Agreement,
as supplemented by Trust Supplement No. 1,
except for such filings as are referred to
above; and,

7. neither the execution, and delivery by the
Loan Participant of the Participation
Agreement or by the Owner Participant of the
Participation Agreement or the Trust
Agreement, as supplemented by Trust
Supplement No. 1, nor other consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby by the
Loan Participant or the Owner Participant,
requires the consent or approval of, or the
giving of notice to, or the registration of,
or the taking of any other action in respect
of the FAA, except (x) the registration of
the Airframe, including the submission of the
Aircraft Registration Application, the Owner
Trustee Affidavit, the Trust Agreement and
Trust Supplement No. 1 to the FAA and (y) the
filings for recordation specified elsewhere

the status of its record title covers only that period

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion will supplement our opinion
dated __________, 1994 and is furnished to you
pursuant to Section 4.02(j)(iii) of the Participation
Agreement (Federal Express Corporation Trust No.
_____) dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Participation
Agreement") among Federal Express Corporation, as
Lessee (the "Lessee"), LLG Aircraft Leasing, L.P., as
Owner Participant (the "Owner Participant"),
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New York Branch
(the "Loan Participant"), First Security Bank of Utah,
National Association, as Owner Trustee (the "Owner
Trustee"), NationsBank of Georgia, National
Association, as Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture
Trustee"), and NationsBank of South Carolina, National
Association, as Pass Through Trustee (the "Pass
Through Trustee"), with respect to that portion of the
Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the "Act"),
relative to the recordation of instruments and the
registration of aircraft under the Act.

The capitalized terms herein shall, unless
otherwise defined, have the same meanings given them
in the Participation Agreement, our opinion dated
__________, 1994 or in Annex I attached hereto.

We have examined and filed with the Federal
Aviation Administration (the "FAA") on this date at
_____ _.m., C.S.T. an executed counterpart of Trust
Indenture and Security Agreement (Federal Express
Corporation Trust No. _____) dated as of March 1, 1994
(the "Trust Indenture") between the Owner Trustee and
the Indenture Trustee, with executed counterpart of
Indenture and Security Agreement Supplement No. 1
(Federal Express Corporation Trust No. _____) dated
__________, 1994 (the "Trust Indenture Supplement") by
the Owner Trustee, covering the Aircraft, attached
thereto.

The Confidential Omissions were intentionally
omitted from the FAA filing counterpart of the Trust
Indenture as containing confidential financial
information.

Based upon our examination of the above
described instruments and of such records of the FAA
as we deemed necessary to render this opinion, it is
our opinion that:

1. the Trust Indenture with the Trust Indenture
Supplement attached is in due form for
recordation by and has been duly filed for
recordation with the FAA pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of the Act;

2. the Airframe is duly registered in the name
of the Owner Trustee pursuant to and in
accordance with the provision of the Act;

3. the Owner Trustee has valid legal title to
the Airframe and the Aircraft is free and
clear of all Liens, except (i) the rights of
the parties under the Lease, as supplemented
by the Lease Supplement and (ii) the security
interest created by the Trust Indenture, as
supplemented by the Trust Indenture
Supplement;

4. the rights of the Owner Trustee and the
Lessee under the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement, with respect to the
Aircraft, are perfected;

5. the Trust Indenture, as supplemented by the
Trust Indenture Supplement, constitutes a
duly perfected first priority security
interest in the Aircraft subject to the
rights of the parties under the Lease, as
supplemented by the Lease Supplement, and a
duly perfected first assignment of all the
right, title and interest of the Owner
Trustee in, to and under the Lease and the
Lease Supplement (insofar as such assignment
affects an interest covered by the recording
system established by the FAA pursuant to
Section 503(a) of the Act), and no other
registration of the Airframe or filings other
than filings with the FAA (which have been
duly effected) are necessary in order to
perfect in any applicable jurisdiction in the
United States (A) the Owner Trustee's title
to the Airframe or (B) such security interest
and assignment (insofar as such assignment
affects an interest covered by the recording
system established by the FAA pursuant to
Section 503(a) of the Act), it being
understood that no opinion is expressed as to
the validity, priority or enforceability of
such security interest and assignment under
local law or as against third parties in
respect of the Airframe and the Engines at a
time when the same, or any of them, are
outside the United States;

6. no authorization, approval, consent, license
or order of, or registration with, or the
giving of notice to, the FAA is required for
the valid authorization, delivery and
performance of the Lease, as supplemented by
the Lease Supplement, the Trust Indenture, as
supplemented by the Trust Indenture
Supplement, or the Trust Agreement, as
supplemented by Trust Supplement No. 1,
except for such filings as are referred to
above and the prior filing of the Lease, the
Lease Supplement, the Trust Agreement and
Trust Supplement No. 1 with the FAA; and,

7. neither the execution, and delivery by the
Loan Participant of the Participation
Agreement or by the Owner Participant of the
Participation Agreement or the Trust
Agreement, as supplemented by Trust
Supplement No. 1, nor other consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby by the
Loan Participant or the Owner Participant,
requires the consent or approval of, or the
giving of notice to, or the registration of,
or the taking of any other action in respect
of the FAA, except (x) the registration of
the Airframe, including the submission of the
Aircraft Registration Application, the Owner
Trustee Affidavit, the Trust Agreement and
Trust Supplement No. 1 to the FAA and (y) the
filings for recordation specified elsewhere
in this opinion.

Since the FAA records reflect that record
title to the Airframe originated with the FAA Bill of
Sale, involving a foreign vendor, our opinion as to
the status of its record title covers only that period
of time commencing with its United States registration
on __________, 1994.

No opinion is expressed as to laws other than
Federal laws of the United States. In rendering this
opinion, we were subject to the accuracy of the FAA,
its employees and agents, in the filing, indexing and
recording of instruments filed with the FAA and in the

"Original Trust Agreement");

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Original Trust

was authorized to (1) enter into the Original Sales
Agreement with Lufthansa, pursuant to which the Owner

WHEREAS, Section 13 of the Original Agreement
to Lease permits a Nonrecourse Financing (as defined

(and if any of the same are received by the Owner
Trustee shall, upon receipt, be paid over to such
Indenture Trustee without deduction, set off or
adjustment of any kind) for distribution in
accordance with the relevant provisions of such
Indenture; provided, that any payments received
by the Owner Trustee from (i) the Lessee with
respect to the Owner Trustee's fees and
disbursements under this Agreement, or (ii) the

be retained by the Owner Trustee and applied
toward the purpose for which such payments were
made;

(b) any amount remaining after application
in full in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
Section 2.01 and which represents payments for
which provision as to the application thereof is
made in any other related Operative Agreement
shall be applied promptly to the purpose for
which such payment shall have been made in
accordance with the terms of such Operative
Agreement; and

(c) after application in accordance with
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.01, or
to the extent received from the related Indenture
Trustee under the terms of the related Indenture
or Collateral Agreement, the balance, if any,
remaining shall be paid to the Trustor.

SECTION 2.02. Excepted Payments. All

respect to such Aircraft.

SECTION 2.03. Other Receipts. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.04 hereof, any payment
received by the Owner Trustee with respect to or in
connection with any Aircraft, or as contemplated by

provisions of such Indenture; and following such
application or release of such Lien, any such payment
for which provision as to the application thereof is
made in any other related Operative Agreements shall
be applied promptly to the purpose for which such
payment shall have been made in accordance with the
terms of such Operative Agreements, and any such
payment received by the Owner Trustee for which no
provision as to the application thereof is made in
such Operative Agreements or in this Article 2 shall,
unless the Trustor shall have otherwise instructed the
Owner Trustee in writing, be distributed promptly to
the Trustor.

SECTION 2.04. Distributions after Default.
Subject to the provisions of Section 2.02 hereof,
(i) all payments received and amounts realized by the
Owner Trustee with respect to or in connection with
any Aircraft, or with respect to or as contemplated by
any Operative Agreement relating thereto, after an
Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and
shall be continuing under the related Indenture and
after the related Certificates shall have become or
been declared due and payable pursuant to the relevant
provisions of such Indenture, or the related Lease
shall have been declared in default (including,
without limitation, any amounts realized by the Owner
Trustee or the Trustor from the exercise of any
remedies pursuant to Section 17.01 of such Lease), as
well as (ii) all funds then held or thereafter received
by the Owner Trustee, as part of this Trust Agreement
or otherwise, with respect to or in connection with
any Aircraft, or with respect to or as contemplated
by any Operative Agreement relating thereto, shall be
distributed to the related Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 2.05. Distributions after Release of
Lien of Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in
Sections 2.02, 2.03 and 2.04 hereof:

received pursuant to Section 17.01 of such Lease
and amounts realized upon the sale or lease of
such Aircraft or any part thereof after the
termination of such Lease with respect thereto),
to the extent received or realized at any time
after the Lien of the related Indenture shall

(b) moneys not included in paragraph (a) of
this Section 2.05 remaining as part of the

Owner Trustee as reimbursement for all expenses
hereunder or under such Lease not theretofore
reimbursed under this Agreement, such Lease or
otherwise and to which the Owner Trustee is entitled
to be reimbursed pursuant to the provisions thereof,
and any balance remaining thereafter shall be
distributed to the Trustor.

SECTION 2.06. Manner of Making
Distributions. The Owner Trustee shall make
distributions or cause distributions to be made to
(i) the Trustor pursuant to this Article 2 by
transferring by wire transfer in immediately available
funds the amount to be distributed to the account set
forth in the related Participation Agreement or to
such other account or accounts of the Trustor as it
may designate from time to time by written notice to
the Owner Trustee (and the Owner Trustee shall use
best efforts to cause such funds to be transferred by
wire transfer on the same day as received, but in any
case not later than the next succeeding Business Day),
and (ii) the relevant Indenture Trustee pursuant to
this Article 2 by paying the amount to be distributed
to such Indenture Trustee in the manner specified in
the related Indenture; provided, that the Owner
Trustee shall invest overnight funds payable to the
Trustor, for the benefit of the Trustor, in
investments that would be permitted by Article 23 of
the Lease (but only to the extent funds are received
on or prior to 1:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) and such
investments are available and, if such investments are
not available to the Owner Trustee which, after
consultation with the Trustor, the Trustor shall
direct) all funds not transferred by wire transfer on
the same day as they were received. Notwithstanding
the foregoing but subject always to the provisions of,
and, for any Aircraft, the Lien created by, the
related Indenture, the Owner Trustee will, if so
requested by the Trustor by written notice, pay any
and all amounts payable by the Owner Trustee hereunder
to the Trustor either (i) by crediting, or causing the
relevant Indenture Trustee to credit, such amount or
amounts to an account or accounts maintained by the
Trustor with the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity or with such Indenture Trustee, as the case
may be, in immediately available funds, or (ii) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as the Trustor may specify with sufficient
information to identify the source and application of
such funds.

ARTICLE 3

THE OWNER TRUSTEE

SECTION 3.01. Acceptance of Trust and
Duties. FSBU confirms its acceptance of the trust
created by the Original Trust Agreement as amended and
restated hereby. FSBU, in its capacity as the Owner
Trustee, agrees to perform the same, including without
limitation, the actions specified in Section 1.01
hereof as herein provided. The Owner Trustee agrees
to disburse all monies that it receives under the
Operative Agreements with respect to any Aircraft in
accordance with the terms hereof. The Owner Trustee
shall not be answerable or accountable in its
individual capacity except as a result of or arising
from (a) the Owner Trustee's willful misconduct or
gross negligence (in its individual capacity or as
trustee), (b) any breach by the Owner Trustee of its
representations, warranties and covenants given in its
individual capacity in this Agreement, Article 5 of
the Lease with respect to any Aircraft, Sections
7.01(b), 7.02(a) and (b) and 7.04 of the Participation
Agreement with respect to any Aircraft or its
representations, warranties and covenants given in its
individual capacity in the relevant provisions of the
Indenture with respect to any Aircraft, (c) the
failure to use ordinary care in receiving, handling
and disbursing funds, (d) Lessor's Liens with respect
to any Aircraft attributable to it in its individual
capacity, and (e) taxes, fees, or other charges on,
based on, or measured by, any fees, commissions or
compensation received by the Owner Trustee in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Lease, Indenture and Operative Agreements with respect
to any Aircraft, including this Agreement.

SECTION 3.02. Limitation on Authority of
Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have no power,
right, duty or authority to manage, control, possess,
use, sell, lease, dispose of or otherwise deal with
any Aircraft, any Airframe, any Engine, any Part
thereof or any other property at any time constituting
a part of the Lessor's Estate with respect to any
Aircraft, or otherwise to take or refrain from taking
any action under or in connection with the Sales
Agreement, any Agreement to Lease Operative Agreement
or the Operative Agreements with respect to any
Aircraft, except (i) to execute and deliver the Sales
Agreement, any Agreement to Lease Operative Agreement
or the Operative Agreements, as the case may be, with
respect to such Aircraft, (ii) to exercise and carry
out or cause to be exercised or carried out the
rights, duties and obligations of the Owner Trustee
hereunder and under the Sales Agreement, the Agreement
to Lease Operative Agreements or the Operative
Agreements, as the case may be, with respect to such
Aircraft, or (iii) as expressly provided in written
instructions from the Trustor given pursuant to
Section 3.03 or 3.04 hereof; provided, that nothing in
this Section 3.02 shall limit in any manner the
obligation of the Owner Trustee to perform and observe
all the terms of the Sales Agreement, the Agreement to
Lease Operative Agreements or the Operative
Agreements, as the case may be, with respect to such
Aircraft or the obligations of the Owner Trustee under
Section 2 of this Agreement.

SECTION 3.03. Notice of Default. In the
event that a Responsible Officer in the Corporate
Trust Administration of the Owner Trustee shall have
actual knowledge of a Pre-Funding Event of Loss with
respect to an Aircraft, a Default or an Event of
Default under the Lease with respect to an Aircraft,
or an Indenture Default or an Indenture Event of
Default under the Indenture with respect to an
Aircraft, the Owner Trustee shall give or cause to be
given to the Trustor and the related Indenture Trustee
prompt notice (in any event, within one Business Day
of the discovery thereof) of such Pre-Funding Event of
Loss, Default, Event of Default, Indenture Default or
Indenture Event of Default by telegram, telex, or
facsimile followed by prompt written notice thereof by
first-class certified mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested. Subject to the terms of Section
3.06(e) hereof and the rights of the Indenture
Trustee, and the obligations of the Owner
Trustee under the related Indenture, the Owner Trustee
shall take such action with respect to such Pre-Funding
Event of Loss, Default, Event of Default, Indenture
Default or Indenture Event of Default as shall be
specified in written instructions from the Trustor,
and if the Owner Trustee shall not have received
instructions from the Trustee within 20 days after
giving notice of such Pre-Funding Event of Loss,
Default, Event of Default, Indenture Default or
Indenture Event of Default to the Trustor, the Owner
Trustee may take such action, or refrain from taking
such action, with respect to such Default, Event of
Default, Indenture Default or Indenture Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Trustor; provided, that the Owner
Trustee shall be under no duty to take or refrain from
taking any such action. For all purposes of this
Agreement and, for any Aircraft, the related Lease, in
the absence of actual knowledge of a Responsible
Officer of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Trustee shall
not be deemed to have knowledge of a Pre-Funding Event
of Loss, Default, Event of Default, Indenture Default
or Indenture Event of Default with respect to such
Aircraft unless notified in writing by the Lessee, the
Trustor or the related Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 3.04. Action Upon Instructions.
Subject in all respects to the terms of the Sales
Agreement, the Agreement to Lease Operative Agreements
or the Operative Agreements, as the case may be, with
respect to any Aircraft and the rights of the related
Indenture Trustee, the related Holders and the Lessee
thereunder, and subject further to the terms of
Article 2 and Sections 3.03, 3.05 and 3.06 hereof,
upon the written instructions at any time and from
time to time of the Trustor, the Owner Trustee will
take such of the following actions as may be specified
in such instructions;

(a) give such notice or direction or
exercise such right, remedy or power under the
Sales Agreement, the Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreements or the Operative Agreements, as the
case may be, with respect to any Aircraft or take
such other action, as shall be specified in such
instructions;

(b) take such action to preserve or protect
the Lessor's Estate with respect to any Aircraft
(including the discharge of Liens and
encumbrances) as may be specified in such
instructions;

(c) approve as satisfactory to it all
matters required by the terms of the Sales
Agreement, the Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreements or the Operative Agreements, as the
case may be, with respect to any Aircraft to be
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee (it being
understood that without written instructions of
the Trustor, the Owner Trustee shall not approve
of any matter as satisfactory to it), except such
approvals as may be required with respect to the
Trustor's transfer of its Beneficial Interest
pursuant to Article 5 hereof;

(d) after the termination or expiration of
the Term of the Lease with respect to an
Aircraft, convey in accordance with such
instructions, such Aircraft and all of the Owner
Trustee's right, title and interest in and to
such Aircraft or any part thereof for such
amount, on such terms and to such purchaser or
purchasers as shall be designated in such
instructions, or retain, lease or otherwise
dispose of such Aircraft or any part thereof as
shall be specified in such instructions;

(e) execute and file any financing statement
(and any continuation statement with respect to
any such financing statement) or any other
similar document relating to the Lessor's Estate
with respect to an Aircraft or the security
interests and assignments created by the
Operative Agreements with respect to such
Aircraft, as may be specified in such
instructions (which instructions shall be
accompanied by an execution form of such
financing statement or such continuation
statement, as the case may be); and

(f) any other action as specified by the
Trustor.

SECTION 3.05. Certain Duties and
Responsibilities of Owner Trustee. (a)(i) the
Owner Trustee undertakes to perform such duties
and only such duties as are specifically set
forth herein and in any other Agreement to Lease
Operative Agreements or Operative Agreements to
which it is a party, and with the degree of care
specified in Section 3.01 hereof, and in
accordance with instructions given by the Trustor
hereunder, and no implied duties, covenants or
obligations owed to the Trustor shall be read
into this Agreement, any such instructions or the
Sales Agreement, the Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreements or the Operative Agreements, as the
case may be, with respect to an Aircraft, against
the Owner Trustee, and the Owner Trustee agrees
that it will not manage, control, possess, use,
sell, lease, dispose of or otherwise deal with
any Aircraft or any part of the Lessor's Estate
with respect to such Aircraft except as required
by the terms of the Sales Agreement, the
Agreement to Lease Operative Agreements or the
related Operative Agreements, as the case may be,
any such instructions and as otherwise provided
herein; and

(ii) in the absence of bad faith on its
part, the Owner Trustee may conclusively rely, as
to the truth of the statements and the
correctness of the opinions expressed therein,
upon certificates or opinions furnished to the
Owner Trustee and conforming to the requirements
of this Agreement or the Sales Agreement, the
Agreement to Lease Operative Agreements or the
Operative Agreements, as the case may be, with
respect to an Aircraft, but in the case of any
such certificates or opinions which by any
provisions hereof or thereof are specifically
required to be furnished to the Owner Trustee,
the Owner Trustee shall be under a duty to
examine the same to determine whether or not they
conform to the requirements of this Trust
Agreement or the Sales Agreement, the Agreement
to Lease Operative Agreements or the Operative
Agreements, as the case may be, with respect to
such Aircraft.

(b) No provision hereof shall require the
Owner Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in
the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if
it shall have reasonable grounds for believing
that repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Owner Trustee agrees in its
individual capacity that it will, at its own cost
and expense, promptly take such action as may be
necessary to discharge duly all Lessor's Liens
with respect to any Aircraft attributable to it
in its individual capacity and will claim no
indemnity therefor hereunder, or under any
Participation Agreement, the Sales Agreement, any
Agreement to Lease Operative Agreements or
Operative Agreements with respect to any
Aircraft.

(c) Whether or not therein expressly so
provided, every provision of this Agreement
relating to the conduct or affecting the
liability of or affording protection to the Owner
Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of
this Section 3.05, except that in the event of a
conflict between this Section 3.05 and Section
3.01 hereof, Section 3.01 hereof shall be
controlling.

(d) The Owner Trustee will furnish to the
Trustor, promptly upon receipt thereof,
duplicates or copies of all reports, notices,
requests, demands, certificates, financial
statements and any other instruments furnished to
the Owner Trustee hereunder or under the Sales
Agreement, the Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreements or the Operative Agreements with
respect to any Aircraft (including those
furnished to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to
the terms of the related Indenture) and not
otherwise furnished to the Trustor.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Owner Trustee shall not be
authorized and shall have no power to "vary the
investment" of the Trustor within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-4(c)(1), it
being understood that, for any Aircraft, the
Owner Trustee shall have the power and authority
to fulfill its obligations under Section 2.06
hereof and Article 23 of the related Lease.

SECTION 3.06. Certain Rights of Owner
Trustee. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.05
hereof:

(a) in the absence of bad faith on its part,
the Owner Trustee may rely and shall be protected
in acting or refraining from acting upon any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, direction,
consent, order or other paper or document
reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties;

(b) any request, direction or authorization
by the Trustor or any other party to any other
Agreement to Lease Operative Agreement, the Sales
Agreement or the Operative Agreements with
respect to an Aircraft shall be sufficiently
evidenced by a request, direction or
authorization in writing, delivered to the Owner

any of the Chairman of the Board, the President,
any Vice President, the Treasurer or Assistant
Treasurer or the Secretary or Assistant Secretary
or other duly authorized officer of such party or
the general partner of the Trustor if the Trustor
is a partnership; and any resolution of the Board
of Directors or committee thereof of such party
or a certificate of the general partner of the
Trustor, if the Trustor is a partnership, shall
be sufficiently evidenced by a copy of such
resolution or certificate certified by the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of such party
or such general partner, as the case may be, to
have been duly adopted and to be in full force
and effect on the date of such certification, and
delivered to the Owner Trustee;

(c) whenever in the administration of this
Agreement the Owner Trustee shall deem it
desirable that a matter be proved or established
prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action
hereunder, under the Sales Agreement or under any
of the other Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreements or Operative Agreements with respect
to an Aircraft, the Owner Trustee (unless other
evidence be herein or therein specifically
prescribed), absent actual knowledge of a
Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee to the
contrary, may rely in good faith upon a
certificate in writing, delivered to the Owner
Trustee and signed by any of the Chairman of the

powers and perform its duties by or through such
attorneys, agents and servants as it shall

the Persons making such request or direction
shall have offered to the Owner Trustee
reasonable security or indemnity against the
costs, expenses and liabilities which might be
incurred by it in compliance with such request or
direction; nor shall the Owner Trustee be
required to take any action deemed to impose on
the Owner Trustee any obligation to take any
action, if the Owner Trustee shall have been
advised by its counsel that such action is
unlawful or is contrary to the terms of this
Agreement, the Sales Agreement, the Agreement to
Lease Operative Agreements or the Operative
Agreements, as the case may be, with respect to
an Aircraft;

(f) The Owner Trustee shall not be bound to
make any investigation into the fact or matters
stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
direction, consent, order or other paper or
document unless a Responsible Officer of the
Owner Trustee has actual knowledge that the facts
or matters stated therein are false or
inaccurate, but the Owner Trustee in its
discretion may make such further inquiry or
investigation into such facts or matters as it
may see fit, and, if the Owner Trustee shall
determine to make such further inquiry or
investigation, it shall be entitled, to the same
extent permitted by the Lessor under the Lease
with respect to any Aircraft, to examine the
books and records of the Lessee to reasonably
determine whether the Lessee is in compliance
with the terms and conditions of such Lease and
to examine the related Aircraft, the related
Airframe, any related Engine or any related Part
thereof personally or by agent or attorney; and

(g) without limiting the generality of
Section 3.05 hereof, except as otherwise provided
in written instructions given to the Owner

generally and by general principles of equity.

SECTION 3.08. Status of Moneys Received.
All moneys received by the Owner Trustee under or
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, the Sales
Agreement or any Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreement or Operative Agreement with respect to each
Aircraft shall constitute trust funds for the purpose

segregated in any manner from any other moneys except
to the extent required by law and may be deposited by
the Owner Trustee under such conditions as may be
prescribed or permitted by law for trust funds, or may
be invested in direct obligations of the United
States.

SECTION 3.09. Self-Dealing. The Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity, or any corporation
in or with which the Owner Trustee may be interested
or affiliated, or any officer or director of any such

relations with the Lessee to the full extent permitted
by law.

SECTION 3.10. Definition of a Responsible

"Responsible Officer" when used with respect to the
Owner Trustee means the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman
of the Board of Directors, the Chairman or Vice-
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of
Directors, the President, any Vice President (whether
or not designated by a number or a word or words added
before or after the title "Vice President"), the
Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, or any other
officer in the Corporate Trust Administration of the
Owner Trustee customarily performing functions similar
to those performed by any of the above designated
officers.

SECTION 3.11. Resignation or Removal of
Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee or any successor
thereof (a) shall resign if required to do so pursuant
to Section 7.02(b) of the Participation Agreement with
respect to any Aircraft and (b) may resign at any time
without cause by giving at least 60 days' prior
written notice to the Trustor and the Indenture
Trustee with respect to each Aircraft, such
resignation in each case to be effective only upon the
appointment of a successor trustee and the acceptance
of such appointment by such successor. In addition,
the Trustor may at any time remove the Owner Trustee
without cause by an instrument in writing delivered to
the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, such
removal to be effective only upon the appointment by
the Trustor of a successor Owner Trustee and the
acceptance of such appointment by such successor.
Upon the giving of notice of resignation or removal of
the Owner Trustee, the Trustor may appoint a successor
Owner Trustee by an instrument signed by the Trustor.
If the Trustor shall not have so appointed a successor
Owner Trustee within 30 days after such resignation or
removal, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee with
respect to any Aircraft or the Trustor may apply to
any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a
successor Owner Trustee to act until such time, if
any, as a successor or successors shall have been
appointed by the Trustor as above provided. Any
successor Owner Trustee so appointed by a court shall
be superseded by any successor Owner Trustee
subsequently appointed by the Trustor.

Each successor Owner Trustee appointed as
herein provided shall be a trust company or banking
corporation which is a Citizen of the United States,
having its principal place of business in the United
States and having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $100,000,000, if there be such an institution
willing, able and legally qualified to perform the
duties of the Owner Trustee hereunder upon reasonable
or customary terms.

SECTION 3.12. Estate and Rights of Successor
Owner Trustee. Any successor Owner Trustee, however
appointed, shall execute and deliver to the
predecessor Owner Trustee, with a copy to the Trustor
and the Indenture Trustee with respect to each
Aircraft, an instrument accepting such appointment,
and thereupon each successor Owner Trustee, without
further act, shall become vested with all the estates,
properties, rights, powers, duties and trust of the
predecessor Owner Trustee in the trusts hereunder with
like effect as if originally named as an Owner Trustee
herein, but nevertheless upon the written request of
such successor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner
Trustee shall execute and deliver an instrument
transferring to such successor Owner Trustee, upon the
trust herein expressed, all estates, properties,
rights, powers, duties, property or moneys then held
by such predecessor Owner Trustee upon the trusts
herein expressed. Upon any such transfer by a
predecessor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner
Trustee shall provide the successor Owner Trustee and
Trustor an accounting of the Lessor's Estate with
respect to any Aircraft and the trusts hereunder.

Upon the appointment of any successor Owner
Trustee hereunder at any time on or after the
Commencement Date with respect to an Aircraft, the
predecessor Owner Trustee will use its best efforts to
cause registration of each such Aircraft to be
transferred upon the records of the Aeronautics
Authority into the name of the successor Owner
Trustee.

SECTION 3.13. Merger or Consolidation of
Owner Trustee. Any corporation into which the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity may be merged or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which
the Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation
to which substantially all the business of the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall, subject to the last sentence of Section 3.11
hereof, be the Owner Trustee under this Agreement
without further act; provided, that such corporation
shall not also be the Indenture Trustee with respect
to any Aircraft.

SECTION 3.14. Co-Trustees. At any time, if
the Owner Trustee and the Trustor shall deem it
necessary or prudent or desirable in order to conform
to legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any
part of the Lessor's Estate with respect to any
Aircraft may at the time be locate, the Trustor and
the Owner Trustee jointly shall have the power, and
shall execute and deliver all instruments, to appoint
one or more persons approved by the Trustor and the
Owner Trustee, to act as co-trustee, or co-trustees,
jointly with the Owner Trustee, or separate trustee or
separate trustees (except insofar as local law makes
it necessary or prudent or desirable for any such co-
trustee or separate trustee to act alone), of all or
any part of the Lessor's Estate with respect to such
Aircraft, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in
such capacity with respect to such Aircraft, such
title to such Lessor's Estate or any part thereof, and
such rights, powers, duties, trusts or obligations as
the Trustor and the Owner Trustee may consider
necessary or prudent or desirable. If the Trustor
shall not have joined in such appointment within 15
days after the receipt by it of a request so to do,
the Owner Trustee alone shall have the power to make
such appointment. The Owner Trustee shall not be
liable for any act or omission of any co-trustee or
separate trustee appointed under this Section 3.14,
except with respect to an appointment made pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence if the Owner
Trustee shall have failed to exercise due care in
making such appointment. No appointment of, or action
by, any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under
this Section 3.14 will relieve the Owner Trustee of
any of its obligations under any Operative Agreement
with respect to any Aircraft or otherwise affect any
of the terms of the Indenture with respect to such
Aircraft or adversely affect the interests of the
related Indenture Trustee or Holders in the related
Trust Indenture Estate.

Any co-trustee or separate trustee may, at
any time by an instrument in writing, constitute the
Owner Trustee its or his attorney-in-fact and agent
with full power and authority to do all acts and
things and to exercise all discretion on its or his
behalf and in its or his name subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

Every additional trustee hereunder shall be a
Citizen of the United States and, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act, and the Owner
Trustee and its successors shall act, subject to the
following provisions and conditions:

(a) all powers, duties, obligations and
rights conferred upon the Owner Trustee in
respect of the custody, control and management of
monies, the Aircraft or documents authorized to
be delivered hereunder, under the Sales
Agreement, the Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreements or under the Participation Agreement
or any other Operative Agreements with respect to
an Aircraft shall be exercised solely by the
Owner Trustee;

(b) all other rights, powers, duties and
obligations conferred or imposed upon the Owner
Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and
exercised or performed by the Owner Trustee and
such additional trustee jointly, except to the
extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in
which any particular act or acts are to be
performed (including the holding of title to the
Lessor's Estate with respect to each Aircraft)
the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent and
unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which
event such rights, powers, duties and obligations
shall be exercised and performed by such
additional trusts;

(c) no power given to, or which is provided
hereby may be exercised by, any such additional
trustee, except jointly with, or with the consent
in writing of, the Owner Trustee;

(d) no trustee hereunder shall be personally
liable by reason of any act or omission of any
other trustee hereunder except as otherwise
provided hereunder; and

(e) the Trustor, at any time, by an
instrument in writing may remove any such
additional trustee.

SECTION 3.15. Interpretation of Agreements.
In the event that the Owner Trustee is unsure as to
the application of any provision of this Agreement,
the Sales Agreement, any Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreement or any Operative Agreement with respect to
an Aircraft, or any other agreement relating to the
transaction contemplated by the Agreement to Lease
Operative Agreements or the Operative Agreements with
respect to such Aircraft, or such provision is
ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to
be, in conflict with any other applicable provision,
or in the event that this Agreement, the Sales
Agreement, any Agreement to Lease Operative Agreement
or any other Operative Agreement with respect to such
Aircraft, permits any determination by the Owner
Trustee or is silent or incomplete as to the course of
action which the Owner Trustee is required to take
with respect to a particular set of facts, the Owner
Trustee shall request instructions of the Trustor and,
to the extent that the Owner Trustee acts in good
faith in accordance with any instructions received
from the Trustor, shall not be liable to any Person
pursuant hereto; provided, that in the event that no
response is made to the Owner Trustee by the Trustor
within 25 days after such request, the Owner Trustee
shall not be liable hereunder to any Person for acts
taken by the Owner Trustee in good faith or for any
failure to act, except to the extent provided in the
last sentence of Section 3.01 hereof.

SECTION 3.16. Not Acting in Individual
Capacity. In carrying out the trusts hereby created,
the Owner Trustee will act solely as trustee hereunder
and not in its individual capacity except as expressly
provided herein, in the Sales Agreement, in any
Operative Agreement with respect to an Aircraft or any
Agreement to Lease Operative Agreements to which it is
a party; and all Persons, other than the Trustor as
provided in this Agreement, having any claim against
the Owner Trustee by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall look only to the related
Lessor's Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof,
except to the extent provided in the last sentence of
Section 3.01 hereof.

SECTION 3.17. Tax Returns. The Owner
Trustee shall be responsible for the keeping of all
appropriate books and records relating to the receipt
and disbursement of all moneys under this Agreement,
the Sales Agreement, any Agreement to Lease Operative
Agreement or any Operative Agreement with respect to
an Aircraft. The Trustor shall be responsible for
causing to be prepared and filed all income tax
returns required to be filed by the Trustor. The
Owner Trustee, upon request, will furnish the Trustor
with all such information as may be reasonably
required from the Owner Trustee, upon request, will
furnish the Trustor with all such information as may
be reasonably required from the Owner Trustee in
connection with any other filing or audit and related
litigation obligations. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for causing to be prepared at the request
and expense of the Trustor all income tax returns
required to be filed with respect to the trust created
hereby and shall execute and file such returns. The
Trustor, upon request, will furnish the Owner Trustee
with all such information as may be reasonably
required from the Trustor that is in its possession in
connection with the preparation of such income tax
returns.

ARTICLE 4

TERMINATION OF TRUST

SECTION 4.01. Termination. This Agreement
and the trust created and provided for hereby shall
cease and be terminated in any one of the following
events, whichever shall first occur:

(a) If the Trustor shall by notice in
writing to the Owner Trustee revoke and terminate
the trust on and as of a dated stated in such
notice, which date shall not be less than ten nor
more than thirty days from the date of mailing
such notice, then on the date specified in such
notice the trust created and provided for hereby
shall cease and terminate; provided, that this
trust shall not be subject to revocation or
termination, in whole or in part, by the Trustor,
nor shall any portion of the Lessor's Estate with
respect to any Aircraft be withdrawn from the
trust hereunder until the later of (i) the time
all Certificates with respect to an Aircraft, and
all other amounts due under the Indentures
relating thereto, shall have been paid in full,
and the Lien of each Indenture with respect to an
Aircraft shall have been released by the related
Indenture Trustee and (ii) the termination of the
Lease; and provided, further, that such notice
shall be accompanied by the written agreement of
Trustor to assume all of the obligations of the
Owner Trustee under the Sales Agreement, the
Agreement to Lease Operative Agreements and the
Operative Agreements with respect to each
Aircraft and all other obligations of the Owner
Trustee incurred by it hereunder or pursuant
hereto in its role as the Owner Trustee;

(b) The sale or other final disposition by
the Owner Trustee of all of its interest in all
property constituting or included in the Lessor's
Estate with respect to any Aircraft and, if the
Indenture with respect to such Aircraft shall
then be in effect, the sale or other disposition
by the Indenture Trustee under such Indenture of
all of its interest in all property constituting
or included in the related Lessor's Estate, and
the final disposition by the Owner Trustee and,
if the Indenture with respect to such Aircraft
shall then be in effect, the Indenture Trustee
under such Indenture, of all moneys or other
property or proceeds constituting part of the
related Lessor's Estate in accordance with the
terms hereof; or

(c) 110 years from the earlier execution of
this Agreement by either party hereto; provided,
however, that if the Trust shall be or become
valid under applicable law for a period
subsequent to 110 years from the earlier
execution of this Agreement by either party
hereto or, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if legislation shall become effective
providing for the validity or permitting the
effective grant of such trust for a period, in
gross, exceeding the period for which such trust
is hereinabove stated to extend and be valid,
then such trust shall not terminate as provided
in the first part of this sentence but shall
extend to and continue in effect until, but only
if such non-termination and extension shall then
be valid under applicable law, such time as the
same shall, under applicable law, cease to be
valid.

In the event of a termination pursuant to
this Section 4.01, if the Indenture with respect to
any Aircraft is still in effect, the Trustor will
promptly and duly execute and deliver to each related
Indenture Trustee such documents and assurances
including, without limitation, conveyances, financing
statements and continuation statements with respect to
financing statements and take such further action as
such Indenture Trustee may from time to time
reasonably request and furnish in order to protect the
rights and remedies created or indented to be created
in favor of such Indenture Trustee under such
Indenture and to create for the benefit of the Holders
a valid lien with respect to, and a first and prior
perfected security interest in, the related Trust
Indenture Estate.

SECTION 4.02. Distribution of Lessor's
Estate upon Termination. Upon any termination of this
trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.01, the
Owner Trustee shall convey the Lessor's Estate with
respect to each Aircraft to such purchaser or
purchasers or the Trustor, as the case may be, and for
such amount and on such terms as shall be specified in
written instructions from the Trustor delivered to the
Owner Trustee prior to the date of termination;
provided, that (i) if at the time of any termination
the Lease with respect to an Aircraft remains in force
and effect, then the Lessor's Estate with respect to
such Aircraft shall be sold subject to such Lease, and
(ii) in the event such written instructions are not
delivered to the Owner Trustee on or before the date
of termination, the Owner Trustee shall transfer title
to Lessor's Estate with respect to such Aircraft to
the Trustor. Upon making such transfer or sale and
accounting for all funds which have come into its
hands, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to receipt
of any sums due and owing to the Owner Trustee for
expenses incurred pursuant hereto as set forth in
Section 2.05.

ARTICLE 5

TRANSFER OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS

The Trustor may assign, convey or otherwise
transfer to all or any portion of the Beneficial
Interest relating to any Aircraft provided that the
Beneficial Interest with respect to any Aircraft may
not be owned by more than three Persons at any time,
provided further that it gives the Lessee and the
Indenture Trustee with respect to each Aircraft at
least 10 days' prior written notice of such
assignment, conveyance other transfer, and provided
further that the Trustor and the transferee enter into
an Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially
in the form of Exhibit B hereto and provided that the
Trustor shall remain secondarily liable for all such
obligations assumed by its successor as Trustor;
provided, that the Trustor need not so agree to remain
and shall not be so secondarily liable if such
transferee is (i) a bank, savings institution, finance
company, leasing company or trust company, national
banking association acting for its own account or in a
fiduciary capacity as trustee or agent under any
pension, retirement, profit sharing or similar trust
or fund, insurance company, fraternal benefit society
or corporation acting for its own account having a
combined capital and surplus (or, if applicable,
consolidated tangible net worth or its equivalent) of
not less than $50,000,000, (ii) a subsidiary of any
Person described in clause (i) where such Person
provides (A) support for the obligations assumed by
such transferee satisfactory to the Lessee, the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee with respect to each
Aircraft or (B) with respect to each Aircraft, an
unconditional guaranty of such subsidiary's obligations
in the form of Exhibit I to the related Participation
Agreement, or (iii) an Affiliate of the original Trustor,
so long as such Affiliate has a combined capital and
surplus (or, if applicable, consolidated tangible net
worth or its equivalent) of not less than $40,000,000.
A transferee hereunder shall be a Citizen of the
United States or shall have established a voting
trust, voting powers or other arrangement reasonable
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee with respect to
the Aircraft being transferred to permit the Owner
Trustee to be the registered owner of such Aircraft
under the Federal Aviation Act. The Owner Trustee
shall not be on notice of or otherwise bound by any
such assignment, conveyance or transfer unless and
until it shall have received an executed counterpart
of the instrument of such assignment, conveyance or
transfer. Upon any such disposition by the Trustor to
a transferee as above provided, the transferee shall
be deemed a "Trustor" for all purposes hereof, and
shall be deemed to have made all the payments
previously made by its transferor and to have acquired
the same interest in the Lessor's Estate with respect
to the Aircraft being transferred as theretofore held
by its transferor; and each reference herein to the
"Trustor" shall thereafter be deemed a reference to
such transferee (to the extent of the Beneficial
Interest transferred). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article 5, in no event
shall the Trustor transfer its interest in the
Beneficial Interest with respect to an Aircraft to any
entity whose business is that of a nationwide or
worldwide overnight or expedited delivery small
package air courier, cargo or freight deliverer or
which competes with the Lessee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article 5, prior to
the commencement of the Lease with respect to any
Aircraft, the Trustor's right to assign its Beneficial
Interest, to the extent relating to such Aircraft,
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10(a) of
the Agreement to Lease.

ARTICLE 6

of all or any part of the Lessor's Estate with respect

Trustee to indemnity, payment and reimbursement as

demand or expense, then the Owner Trustee, in its

Trustee) agrees that it shall have no right against (except

not execute any such supplement, amendment, waiver or
modification without the prior written consent of the
Trustor, (B) if in the reasonable opinion of the Owner

dated the Commencement Date for such Aircraft, which
shall particularly describe such Aircraft.

(c) It shall not be necessary that any
request pursuant to this Section 6.02 specify the
particular form of the proposed document to be
executed pursuant to such request, but it shall be
sufficient if such request shall indicate the
substance thereof. Promptly after the execution by
FSBU or the Owner Trustee of any document pursuant to
this Section 6.02, the Owner Trustee shall mail a
conformed copy thereof to the Trustor and the
Indenture Trustee under each Indenture with respect to
an Aircraft, but the failure of the Owner Trustee to
mail such conformed copies shall not impair or affect
the validity of such documents.

SECTION 6.03. Nature of Title of Trustor.
The Trustor shall not have any legal title to any part
of the Lessor's Estate with respect to any Aircraft.

ARTICLE 7

CERTAIN LIMITATIONS

SECTION 7.01 Limitations on Control. The
Trustor agrees to certain limitations on control in
order to ensure the eligibility of the Aircraft for
United States registration under the Federal Aviation
Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, but subject to the other provisions of this
Article 7, from and after the date of this Agreement
and until termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 4 or termination of this Article pursuant to
Section 7.07 hereof, (a) the Trustor shall not have
any right (i) to remove the Owner Trustee, (ii) to
instruct the Owner Trustee with respect to the
ownership or operation of any of the Aircraft, (iii)
to give consents with respect to any lawful action of
the Owner Trustee not prohibited by this Agreement
relating to the ownership or operation of any of the
Aircraft, and (iv) to consent to the amendment or
supplement of this Agreement (collectively, the
"Control Rights") and (b) the Owner Trustee shall have
absolute and complete discretion in all matters as to
which the Trustor would have had any Control Rights,
but for the provisions of this Article 7; provided,
however, the Owner Trustee agrees that it shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Trustor,
consent to (x) any amendment, supplement or
termination of this Agreement or any Operative
Agreement to which the Owner Trustee is a party or (y)
the sale, lease, sublease, mortgage or other
disposition of all or a portion of the Trust Estate
other than as provided in this Agreement. The
discretion given to the Owner Trustee in clause (b) of
the immediately preceding sentence (x) is in addition
to the discretion given to the Owner Trustee under the
other Articles of this Agreement and (y) is expressly
limited to the Control Rights that, but for the
provisions of this Article 7, would be held or
exercisable by the Trustor, and does not extend to any
other rights, powers or privileges in respect of the
Beneficial Interest of the Trustor.

SECTION 7.02. Discretion and Actions of
Owner Trustee. (a) The Owner Trustee, in exercising
its discretion under this Article 7, shall exercise
its best judgment and shall not be liable for any
action taken or failed to be taken hereunder, except
for its gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and
shall exercise the Control Rights in connection with
all matters involving the ownership and operation of
the Aircraft by the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee
shall not be required, and shall have no duty or
obligation, to exercise Control Rights in respect of
any other matters.

(b) The Owner Trustee, in exercising any
Control Rights, may act directly or through any agents
or attorneys and may consult with counsel, accountants
and other skilled persons to be selected and retained
by it, and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for
anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith in
accordance with the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons and the
Owner Trustee shall not be liable for the negligence
of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled
persons.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, the Owner Trustee, in exercising any Control
Rights pursuant to this Article 7 in connection with
all matters involving the ownership or operation of
any of the Aircraft by the Owner Trustee, shall be
free of any kind of control by the Trustor and shall
exercise the Control Rights as it in its discretion
shall deem necessary to protect the interests of the
United States, notwithstanding any countervailing
interests of any foreign power which, or whose
citizens may, have a direct or indirect interest in
the Lessor's Estate with respect to any Aircraft and
any such action by the Owner Trustee shall not be
considered malfeasance or in breach of any obligation
which the Owner Trustee might otherwise have to the
Trustor. In exercising any Control Rights pursuant to
this Article 7 in connection with any matters which
may arise not relating to the ownership and operation
of any of the Aircraft, the Owner Trustee shall be
permitted, but shall be under no duty, to seek the
advice of the Trustor before exercising such Control
Rights, subject, however, to the proviso in the first
sentence of Section 7.01. The Owner Trustee, promptly
after each exercise of any Control Rights hereunder,
shall notify the Trustor of the exercise thereof.

SECTION 7.03. Removal. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement relating to any right
or power of the Trustor to remove the Owner Trustee,
the Owner Trustee may be removed only for its gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 7.04. Payments. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Article 7, the Trustor and
not the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to receive
from the Owner Trustee or otherwise all payments or
insurance proceeds, and other payments of whatsoever
kind and nature payable to the Trustor pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement with
respect to an Aircraft in the same manner as if the
Control Rights had not been transferred to the Owner
Trustee and held in trust hereunder.

SECTION 7.05. The Owner Trustee Acts as
Trustee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in exercising any Control Rights pursuant
to this Article 7, the Owner Trustee acts solely as
trustee and not in its individual capacity, and except
as may be otherwise expressly provided in Section 7.02
hereof, all persons having any claim against First
Security or the Owner Trustee by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Article 7 shall not
have any recourse to First Security.

SECTION 7.06. Waiver of Claim Against the
Owner Trustee. To the extent permitted by law, the
Trustor agrees to waive and does hereby waive any and
all claims of every kind and nature which hereafter
the Trustor may have against First Security, its
successors and assigns, and does release the Owner
Trustee, its successors and assigns, from any
liability whatsoever arising out of or in connection
with the exercise of its powers or the performance of
its duties under this Article 7, except liability for
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Owner
Trustee.

SECTION 7.07. Amendments, Termination of
Article 7. Notwithstanding Section 6.02, so long as
the Aircraft shall be registered under the laws of the
United States and until termination of this Agreement
and the trust created hereby, this Article 7 shall not
be amended, supplemented or modified unless the FAA
shall have concluded that such amendment, supplement
or modification would not cause any Aircraft to be
ineligible for registration in the United States,
provided, however, that this Article 7 shall terminate
without any notice or action of the Owner Trustee on
the earlier of (i) the date the Trustor shall have
become a "citizen of the United States" as defined in
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act, (ii) the
date the Owner Trustee being a "citizen of the United
States" as defined in Section 101(16) of the Federal
Aviation Act is no longer required to maintain
registration of any of the Aircraft with the FAA or
(iii) such earlier date as the Trustor may, with the
prior written consent of the Indenture Trustee and the
Lessee, deliver to the Owner Trustee a written notice
of its election to terminate this Article 7. The
Trustor shall send written notification to the FAA,
with copies thereof to the Lessee, the Owner Trustee
and each Indenture Trustee with respect to an
Aircraft, of any termination of this Article 7.

This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, FSBU and the Trustor have
caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of
March __, 1994.

1. Definitions. As used in this Guarantee, terms
defined in the Participation Agreement are used herein as
therein defined, unless otherwise defined herein.

2. Guarantee. a. The Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as primary
obligor and not merely as a surety to the Beneficiaries and
their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and
assigns, the prompt and complete payment by the Obligor when
due (whether at the stated due date thereof, by acceleration
or otherwise) of, and the faithful performance of, and
compliance with, all payment obligations of the Obligor
under the Operative Agreements or any related documents owed
to such Beneficiary, strictly in accordance with the terms
thereof and the timely performance of all other obligations
of the Obligor owed to such Beneficiary thereunder strictly

c. If for any reason any Obligation to be
performed or observed by the Obligor (whether affirmative or
negative in character) shall not be observed or performed
strictly in accordance with the terms thereof, or if any
amount payable by the Obligor in connection with any
Obligation shall not be paid promptly when due and payable,
the Guarantor shall perform or observe or cause to be
performed or observed each such Obligation or undertaking
and shall pay such amount at the place and to the person or
entity entitled thereto pursuant to the Operative Agreements
regardless of whether or not any Beneficiary or anyone
acting on behalf of any of them shall have instituted any
suit, action or proceeding or exhausted its remedies or
taken any steps to enforce any rights against the Obligor or
any other person or entity to compel any such performance or
to collect all or any part of such amount pursuant to the
provisions of the Operative Agreements or at law or in
equity, or otherwise, and regardless of any other condition
or contingency.

d. The Guarantor irrevocably waives promptness,
diligence, demand, and all notices whatsoever as to the
Obligations and covenants guaranteed hereby, and any other
circumstances which might otherwise constitute a defense
available to it, or a discharge of it (other than the
defense of payment or performance) and agrees that it shall
not be required to consent to or receive any notice of any
amendment or modification of, or waiver, consent or
extension with respect to, the Participation Agreement, the
Trust Agreement or the other Operative Agreements to which
the Obligor is a party that may be made or given as provided
herein or otherwise.

e. The Guarantor further agrees to pay all
expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel) that may be paid or incurred
by the beneficiaries hereof in enforcing any rights with
respect to, or collecting, any or all of the Obligations
and/or enforcing any rights with respect to, or collecting
against, the Guarantor under this Guarantee.

f. The Guarantor understands and agrees that its
Obligations hereunder shall be construed as continuing,
absolute and unconditional without regard to (a) the
validity, regularity or enforceability of any Operative
Agreement, any of the Obligations or any collateral security
therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect
thereto at any time or from time to time held by any
Beneficiary, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other
than a defense of full payment or performance) that may at
any time be available to or be asserted by the Obligor
against any Beneficiary, or (c) any other circumstances
whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the
Obligor or the Guarantor) that constitutes, or might be
construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of
the Obligor for the Obligations, or of the Guarantor under
this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance.

g. The obligation of the Guarantor hereunder
will not be discharged by: (a) any extension or renewal
with respect to any obligation of the Obligor under the
Operative Agreements; (b) any modification of, or amendment
or supplement to, any such Operative Agreement; (c) any
furnishing or acceptance of additional security or any
release of any security; (d) any waiver, consent or other
action or inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of any
right, remedy or power with respect to the Obligor or any
change in the structure of the Obligor; (e) any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, composition,
liquidation, dissolution or similar proceedings with respect
to the Obligor; (f) except as provided in Section 14 hereof,
any change in ownership of the shares of capital stock of
the Guarantor or the Obligor; or (g) any other occurrence
whatsoever, except payment in full of all amounts payable by
the Obligor under the Operative Agreements and performance
in full of all Obligations of the Obligor in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Operative Agreements.

3. No Subrogation, Contribution, Reimbursement or
Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Guarantee, the Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert any
rights which may have arisen in connection with this
Guarantee to be subrogated to any of the rights (whether
contractual, under the Bankruptcy Code, including Section
509 thereof, under common law or otherwise) of any
Beneficiary against the Obligor or against any Beneficiary
for the payment of the Obligations until indefeasible
payment or performance in full of the Obligations. The
Guarantor hereby further agrees not to assert any
contractual, common law, statutory or other rights of
reimbursement, contribution, exoneration or indemnity (or
any similar right) from or against the Obligor or any other
Person which may have arisen in connection with this
Guarantee if any payment under this Guarantee is outstanding
at such time. So long as any payment under this Guarantee
is outstanding, if any amount shall be paid by or on behalf
of the Obligor to the Guarantor on account of any of the
rights referred to above in this paragraph, such amount
shall be held by the Guarantor in trust, segregated from
other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon
receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the applicable
Beneficiary in the exact form received by the Guarantor
(duly endorsed by the Guarantor to the applicable
Beneficiary, if required).

4. Amendment with Respect to the Obligations;
Waiver of Rights. The Guarantor shall remain fully
obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any
reservation of rights against the Guarantor and without
notice to or further assent by the Guarantor, any demand for
payment or performance of any of the Obligations made by any
Beneficiary may be rescinded by such party and any of the
Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability
of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any
collateral security or guaranty therefor or right of offset
with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in
part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated,
compromised, waived, surrendered or released by any
Beneficiary and any Operative Agreement and/or any
collateral security document or other guaranty or document
in connection therewith, may be amended, modified,
supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in
accordance with the provisions thereof from time to time,
and any collateral security, guaranty or right of offset at
any time held by any Beneficiary for the payment or
performance of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged,
waived, surrendered or released. No Beneficiary shall have
any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any
Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations
or for this Guarantee or any property subject thereto. When
making any demand hereunder against the Guarantor, a
Beneficiary may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a
similar demand on the Obligor or any other guarantor, and
any failure by a Beneficiary to make any such demand or to
collect any payments from the Obligor or any such other
guarantor or any release of the Obligor or such other
guarantor shall not relieve the Guarantor of its obligations
or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the
rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of
law, of any Beneficiary against the Guarantor. For the
purposes hereof, "demand" shall include, but not be limited
to, the commencement and continuance of any legal
proceedings. [The Guarantor represents and warrants that it
owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of the capital stock of
the Obligor and that its obligations hereunder shall
continue unimpaired, even if the Guarantor no longer owns,
directly or indirectly, all or any portion of the capital
stock of the Obligor.]*

* Insert in the case of a guarantee in connection with a
transfer.

5. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. The
Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation,
renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and
notice of or proof of reliance by any Beneficiary upon this
Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee; the Obligations,
and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been
created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended,
amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guarantee; and all
dealings between the Obligor or the Guarantor and any
Beneficiary shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have
been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee.
The Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand
for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon
the Transferee or the Guarantor with respect to the
Obligations. The Guarantor understands and agrees that this
Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and
unconditional guaranty of payment and performance (and not
merely of collectability) without regard to (a) the
validity, regularity or enforceability of any Operative
Agreement or any related agreement, any of the Obligations
or any collateral security therefor or guaranty or right of
offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time
held by any Beneficiary, (b) any defense, set-off or
counterclaim (other than a defense of full payment or
performance) that may at any time be available to or be
asserted by the Obligor against any Beneficiary, or (c) any
other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or
knowledge of the Obligor or the Guarantor) that constitutes,
or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal
discharge of the Obligor for the Obligations, or of the
Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any
other instance. When pursuing its rights and remedies
hereunder against the Guarantor, any Beneficiary may, but
shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and
remedies as it may have against the Obligor or any other
person or entity or against any collateral security or
guaranty for the Obligations or any right of offset with
respect thereto, and any failure by any Beneficiary to
pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any
payments from the Obligor or any such other person or entity
or to realize upon any such collateral security or guaranty
or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of
the Obligor or any such other person or entity or any such
collateral security, guaranty or right of offset, shall not
relieve the Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall
not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether
express, implied or available as a matter of law, of any
Beneficiary against the Guarantor. This Guarantee shall
remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance
with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantor and
the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the
benefit of the Beneficiaries, and their respective
successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, until the
earlier of (x) all of the Obligations and the obligations of
the Guarantor under this Agreement shall have been satisfied
by payment and performance in full, (y) the right, title and
interest of the Obligor shall have been transferred to a
Person meeting the requirements of Article 5 of the Trust
Agreement, it being understood that this Guarantee shall
remain in effect with respect to obligations of the Obligor
arising prior to such transfer and (z) the Obligor obtaining
a tangible net worth equalling or exceeding [$50,000,000
(Fifty Million Dollars)].* The Guarantor further agrees
that, without limiting the generality of this Guarantee, if
any Beneficiary (or any assignee thereof) shall be prevented
by applicable law from exercising its remedies (or any of
them) against the Obligor under any Operative Agreement such
Beneficiary (or any assignee thereof) shall be entitled to
receive hereunder from the Guarantor the sums that would
have otherwise been due from the Obligor had such remedies
been able to be exercised.

6. Reinstatement. This Guarantee shall continue
to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at
any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or
returned by any Beneficiary upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Obligor or
the Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of
a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or
similar officer for, the Obligor or the Guarantor or any
substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as
though such payments had not been made. The Guarantor shall
not commence any "case" (as defined in Title 11 of the
United States Code) against the Obligor.

that payments hereunder shall be paid without set-off,
counterclaim, deduction or withholding, and shall be made in

ERISA, the continuing accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 6.01(k)(ix) and

shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to
Section 13 hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise

have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and
conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in
exercising, on the part of any Beneficiary, any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.
No single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. A waiver by a Beneficiary of any right or
remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed
as a bar to any right or remedy that such Beneficiary would
otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and
remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised
singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.

combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least
[$50,000,000]*, or is not a corporation with a net worth of

agreement, substantially in the form of this Guarantee,
guaranteeing the Obligations of the Obligor under the
Operative Agreements or provide such a guarantee from such a
bank, lending institution or corporation satisfactory to
each Beneficiary, so that there will then be existing both
such guaranty agreement as well as the guaranty agreement
executed by the Subsequent Guarantee; in such event, the
Beneficiaries shall have the right to enforce the
obligations of the Guarantor under such guaranty agreement
without first proceeding against the Subsequent Guarantor
under its guaranty referred to above.

LEASE AGREEMENT
(FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION TRUST ______)

Lease Agreement (Federal Express Corporation
Trust _______) (this "Lease") dated as of
__________ 1, 199_ between FIRST SECURITY BANK OF
UTAH, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking
association, not in its individual capacity but solely
as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement (as defined
in Article 1 below) (the "Lessor"), and FEDERAL
EXPRESS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Lessee").

W I T N E S S E T H :

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Participation Agreement (as
hereinafter defined), the Lessee desires to lease from
the Lessor and the Lessor is willing to lease to the
Lessee the Aircraft (as hereinafter defined) in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in
this Lease;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
mutual promises herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is
hereby acknowledged by the parties, the Lessor and the
Lessee agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

DEFINITIONS

Unless the context otherwise requires, the
capitalized terms herein shall have the meanings given
in Schedule II to the Participation Agreement, a copy
of which schedule is annexed hereto as Schedule I, for
all purposes of this Lease and shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and the plural forms
of the terms defined.

ARTICLE 2

ACCEPTANCE UNDER THE LEASE

Section 2.01. Lease of Aircraft. The
Lessor, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Lease, the Agreement to
Lease (to the extent relating to the Aircraft) and in
the Participation Agreement, hereby agrees to lease
the Aircraft to the Lessee, and the Lessee hereby
agrees to lease the Aircraft from the Lessor.
Execution by the Lessee of the Lease Supplement with
respect to the Aircraft shall be conclusive evidence
that such conditions have been satisfied or waived.
The Lease shall last for the Term, at all times during
which full legal title to the Aircraft shall remain
vested in the Lessor to the exclusion of the Lessee,
notwithstanding the possession and use thereof by the
Lessee or any other party.

ARTICLE 3

RENT

Section 3.01. Basic Rent. The Lessee agrees
to pay to the Lessor in immediately available funds
denominated in United States Dollars on each Rent
Payment Date during the Basic Term, Basic Rent in the
amount set forth for such Rent Payment Date on
Schedule II hereto. Each payment of Basic Rent shall
be payable in arrears and shall be accrued over the
six month period ending on and including the day
immediately preceding the Rent Payment Date on which
such arrears payment of Basic Rent is scheduled to be made.

Anything contained in this Lease to the
contrary notwithstanding, on each Rent Payment Date
after the Exchange Date (other than the first Rent
Payment Date after the Commencement Date, at which
time Basic Rent will be prorated as provided in
Schedule II hereto) the Lessee shall pay as Basic Rent
that amount which shall be, under any circumstances
and in any event, at least sufficient to pay in full,
any installment of principal of and interest on the
Certificates required to be paid pursuant to the
Certificates (other than amounts becoming due on
account of the exercise of remedies pursuant to
Section 17 hereof) on such Rent Payment Date.

Section 3.02. Supplemental Rent. The Lessee
agrees to pay or cause to be paid to the Lessor, or to
whomever shall be entitled to it, any and all
Supplemental Rent promptly as the same shall become
due. If the Lessee fails to pay any Supplemental Rent
when due, the Lessor shall have all rights, powers and
remedies provided for in this Lease, or by law or
equity or otherwise in the case of nonpayment of Basic
Rent. The Lessee will also pay to the person entitled
thereto, on demand, as Supplemental Rent, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, an amount equal to
interest at the Past Due Rate on any part of any
installment of Basic Rent not paid when due, for any
period until the same shall be paid and on any payment
of Supplemental Rent not paid when due, for the period
until the same shall be paid. In addition, in the
case of (i) any prepayment of the Certificates
pursuant to Section 6.02(a)(ii), 6.02(a) (iii) (if
clause (A) of Section 8.02(a) of the Indenture is
applicable), or 6.02(a)(iv) of the Indenture or (ii)
any purchase of the Certificates pursuant to clause
(A) of the first sentence of Section 8.02(a) of the
Indenture, unless any such prepayment or purchase arises
out of an Indenture Event of Default that occurs at a
time when no Event of Default is continuing, the Lessee
will pay to the Lessor, as Supplemental Rent, on the
date of such prepayment or purchase, an amount equal to
the aggregate amount of the Make-Whole Premium payable
upon such prepayment or purchase pursuant to the Indenture.
The expiration or other termination of the Lessee's
obligation to pay Basic Rent shall not limit or otherwise
modify the obligations of the Lessee with respect to
the payment of Supplemental Rent.

Section 3.03. Payment to Indenture Trustee.
All Rent payable by the Lessee to the Lessor shall be
paid to the Lessor at its principal office at 79 South
Main Street, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84111, or as the
Lessor may otherwise direct, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars with
sufficient information to identify sources and
applications of such funds no later than 11:00 a.m.,
Central Time on the due date of such payment;
provided, however, that on and after the Exchange Date
and so long thereafter as the Indenture shall not
have been discharged, the Lessor hereby directs, and
the Lessee agrees, that all Rent (other than Excepted
Payments) and all amounts referred to in Section 3.01
hereof, shall be paid directly to the Indenture
Trustee at its principal office no later than
11:00 a.m., Central Time, on the due date of such
payment. In any case where a scheduled Rent Payment
Date shall not be a Business Day, such Rent Payment
Date shall be adjourned to the next succeeding
Business Day.

Section 3.04. Costs and Expenses. As
between the Lessor and the Lessee, all obligations
under this Lease shall be done, performed and complied
with at the Lessee's cost and expense, whether or not
so expressed, unless otherwise expressly stated to the
contrary.

ARTICLE 4

RENEWAL OPTIONS AND PURCHASE OPTIONS

Section 4.01. Renewal Options. (a) Election
to Renew. The Lessee shall provide the Lessor with
irrevocable written notice (the "Preliminary Notice")
not less than 1 year prior to the end of the Basic
Term, whether it will exercise its options either to
renew this Lease pursuant to this Section 4.01 or to
purchase the Aircraft pursuant to Section 4.02(a)(A).
Provided that, (i) no Payment Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time of renewal, (ii) this Lease has not otherwise
expired or terminated, and (iii) the Lessee shall have
delivered the Preliminary Notice, the Lessee may, by
irrevocable written notice delivered to the Lessor not
less than 180 days prior to the end of the Basic Term,
elect to extend the Term for a Renewal Term commencing
on the expiration of the Basic Term and ending on the
second annual anniversary of such expiration of the
Basic Term. The rent payable with respect to any such
Renewal Term shall be equal to the then-current Fair
Market Rental of the Aircraft.

(b) Terms and Conditions. Any such renewal
shall be on the same terms and conditions as provided
herein, except that during any Renewal Term, the
Stipulated Loss Value as of any Stipulated Loss Value
Determination Date during the Renewal Term be equal to
the greater of Stipulated Loss Value on the last day
of the Basic Term and the Fair Market Value of the
Aircraft as of the commencement of such Renewal Term.

Section 4.02. Purchase Option. (a) Election
to Purchase. Provided that (i) this Lease has not
otherwise expired or terminated, and (ii) the Lessee
shall have previously given the Preliminary Notice
under Section 4.01(a) hereof in the case of paragraph
(A) below or the applicable notice for each other
paragraph below, as the case may be, the Lessee may:

(A) by irrevocable written notice delivered
to the Lessor and the Owner Participant not less
than 180 days prior to the end of the Basic Term,
elect to purchase the Aircraft on the last day of
the Basic Term (provided that the Indenture has
been discharged or will be discharged
concurrently with such purchase) for an amount
equal to the Fair Market Value thereof; or

(B) by irrevocable written notice delivered
to the Lessor and the Owner Participant not less
than 365 days prior to the end of the Renewal
Term, if any, elect to terminate the Lease and
purchase the Aircraft on the first day following
such Renewal Term at a price equal to the Fair
Market Value of the Aircraft on such day; or

(C) exercise the purchase option in this
Section 4.02(a)(C) which is more particularly
described in Schedule V hereto by reference to
this Section 4.02(a)(C) and which option shall be
in an amount not less than Fair Market Value; or

(D) exercise the purchase option in this
Section 4.02(a)(D) which is more particularly
described in Schedule V hereto by reference to
this Section 4.02(a)(D) and which option shall be
in an amount not less than Fair Market Value.

The Lessee shall give the Lessor, the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee not less than
120 days' prior written notice of its election to
purchase pursuant to Section 4.02(a)(C) or 4.02(a)(D)
hereof. Such notice shall either direct the Lessor to
prepay the Certificates in full on such Termination
Date pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
Indenture or state that the Lessee shall exercise its
option to assume all of the Certificates pursuant to
Section 7.12 of the Participation Agreement as of such
Termination Date; provided, however, that in no event
may the Lessee assume the Certificates pursuant to
such Section 7.12 prior to the Exchange Date. The
Lessee's notice pursuant to Section 4.02(a)(C) or
4.02(a)(D) hereof shall become irrevocable 10 days
prior to the applicable Termination Date designated in
such notice.

(b) Terms and Conditions. If the Lessee
elects to purchase the Aircraft pursuant to Section
4.02(a), the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on the
applicable Termination Date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the applicable purchase
price together with any amounts past due hereunder and
all other Supplemental Rent due under this Lease, the
Participation Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement whereupon the Lessor will
transfer to the Lessee, without recourse or warranty
(except as to the absence of Lessor's Liens) and
subject to the disclaimers set forth in Section 5.01
hereof, all of the Lessor's right, title and interest
in and to the Aircraft on an "as-is, where is" basis.
In connection with such transfer, the Lessee shall prepare
and the Lessor shall execute or arrange for the execution
of a bill of sale evidencing such transfer and any other
document reasonably deemed by the parties to be
necessary to convey such right, title and interest to
the Lessee and, if applicable, will deliver to the
Lessee such instrument as the Lessor shall have
received from the Indenture Trustee releasing the
Aircraft from the Lien of the Indenture. In
connection with any termination or proposed
termination of the Lease, the Lessee shall pay, at the
time of the applicable Termination Date, all related
reasonable costs and expenses of the Owner
Participant, the Lessor and the Indenture Trustee.

Section 4.03. Appraisal Procedures. (a)
Generally. Whenever Fair Market Rental or Fair Market
Value is required to be determined under this Lease
(unless otherwise provided herein), it shall be
determined by the mutual agreement of the Lessor and
the Lessee in accordance with the definitions of such
terms in Article 1. If the Lessee and the Lessor
cannot agree within twenty (20) days after the
Lessee's notice of election to purchase the Aircraft
or notice to extend the Term, as the case may be, such
amount shall be determined by independent appraisal
conducted by appraisers selected pursuant to Section
4.03(b). At any time prior to final determination of
such amount pursuant to Section 4.03(b), the Lessee
and the Lessor shall be entitled to submit to the
appraisers (and shall submit to each other any bids
submitted to the appraisers) any bids from unrelated
third parties, and such bids shall be accorded the
weight such appraisers deem appropriate. The Lessor
and the Lessee shall each have an opportunity to
comment on any such bids after receiving a copy
thereof.

(b) Selection. If an independent appraisal
is required pursuant to this Lease, the Lessor and the
Lessee shall consult for the purpose of appointing a
mutually acceptable, qualified aircraft appraiser. If
they are unable to agree on a single appraiser within
ten (10) Business Days, then the independent appraisal
shall be arrived at by mutual agreement of two
nationally recognized, independent aircraft
appraisers, one chosen by the Lessor and one chosen by
the Lessee, or, if such appraisers cannot agree on the
amount of such appraisal, their appraisals shall be
treated in the manner described in Section 4.03(c)
hereof with an appraisal arrived at by a third
nationally recognized, independent aircraft appraiser
chosen by the mutual consent of such two appraisers;
provided, however, that if either party shall fail to
appoint an appraiser within fifteen (15) Business Days
after a written request to do so by the other party,
or if such two appraisers cannot agree on the amount
of such appraisal and fail to appoint a third
appraiser within twenty (20) Business Days after the
date of the appointment of the second of such
appraisers, then either party may initiate an
arbitration proceeding with the American Arbitration
Association for purposes of appointing a nationally
recognized, independent aircraft appraiser.

(c) Valuation. If one appraiser is chosen,
the value determined by such appraiser shall be final
and binding upon the Lessor and the Lessee. If two
appraisers are chosen, one appraiser by the Lessor and
one by the Lessee, and such appraisers agree on the
value, such value shall be final and binding upon the
Lessor and the Lessee. If three appraisers shall be
appointed and the difference between the determination
which is farther from the middle determination is more
than 125% of the difference between the middle
determination and the third determination, then such
farther determination shall be excluded, the remaining
two determinations shall be averaged, and such average
shall be final and binding upon the Owner Participant
and the Lessee. Otherwise, the average of all three
determinations shall be final and binding upon the
Owner Participant and the Lessee.

(d) Rules of Appraisal. Any appraisal
pursuant to this Section 4.03 shall be conducted in
accordance with the commercial rules of the American
Arbitration Association as then in effect, as modified
by this Section 4.03 and the definitions of Fair
Market Value and Fair Market Rental. All expenses of
any independent appraisal shall be borne by the
Lessee, except that each of the Lessee and the Owner
Participant (in the case of the Lessor) shall bear any
fees, costs and expenses of its respective attorneys
in connection with such appraisal except that in the
case of an Event of Default or in the case of a
revocation by the Lessee of its election to terminate
the Lease pursuant to Section 4.02 or Article 10
hereof, such expenses shall be borne by the Lessee.

INDENTURE TRUSTEE, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE LESSEE ON
THE OTHER, ARE TO BE BORNE BY THE LESSEE.

THE FOREGOING, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND UNDERSTOOD
BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN
THE AGREEMENT TO LEASE, THE LESSOR SHALL BEAR THE SOLE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL RISKS, COSTS, EXPENSES AND
LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF THE OWNERSHIP, USE,

RISKS, COSTS, EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES. FOR THE
AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IT IS FURTHER AGREED BETWEEN THE
PARTIES THAT THE LESSOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
SUCH RISKS, COSTS, EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES WHICH
ARISE SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXECUTION OF SUCH LEASE
SUPPLEMENT BY THE LESSEE TO THE EXTENT THEY ARISE OUT

Section 5.01 have been negotiated by the Lessor and
the Lessee and, except as provided in Section 7.04 of
the Participation Agreement or in Section 7(c) of the
Agreement to Lease, are intended to be a complete
exclusion and negation of any representations or
warranties of the Lessor, express or implied, with
respect to the Airframe and each Engine that may arise
pursuant to any law now or hereafter in effect, or
otherwise.

Section 5.02. No Modification of Other
Warranties. None of the provisions of this Article 5
or any other provision of this Lease shall be deemed
to amend, modify or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties or other obligations
(express or implied) of the Lessee. So long as an
Event of Default shall not have occurred and be
continuing under this Lease and to the extent
permitted under the applicable warranty, patent
indemnity, or service-life policy, (i) the Lessor
shall assign or otherwise make available to the Lessee
such rights as the Lessor may have under any warranty,
patent indemnity, or service-life policy made or given
by the Aircraft manufacturer, Engine manufacturer, DA
or any other subcontractor performing work on the
Aircraft pursuant to the Modification Agreement or any
of their respective subcontractors or suppliers, and
any other claims against the Aircraft manufacturer and
Engine manufacturer or any such subcontractor or
supplier with respect to the Aircraft, including all
rights to demand, accept and retain all rights in and
to property (other than the Aircraft), data and
services of any kind which the Aircraft manufacturer
and Engine manufacturer are obligated to provide; and
(ii) all payments pursuant to any manufacturer's or
subcontractor's warranty, patent indemnity, or
service-life policy obligation shall be paid to the
Lessee and the Lessee shall apply such payments to the
cost of repair or correction of any condition of the
Aircraft which gave rise to such payments, and the
excess (if any) shall be paid to the Lessor.

Section 5.03. Certain Agreements of the
Lessee. The Lessee agrees with the Lessor for the
benefit of the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee that the Lessee shall perform the agreements,
covenants and indemnities of the Lessee set forth in

regulatory agency or body of any other
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft may then be
registered and, provided, however, the Lessee
shall not be in default of its obligation in this
Section 7.01(b)(iii) to maintain the Aircraft's
airworthiness certification in good standing if
the Aircraft loses its airworthiness
certification, such loss is curable and the
Lessee undertakes such cure promptly, diligently,
and continuously, using its best efforts but,
provided, further, that in the event such loss is
not a loss of the character described in clause
(iv) of the definition of Event of Loss and is
not curable or, if curable, has not been cured
within twelve (12) months of the date the
airworthiness certification was lost, unless the
Lessor elects to retain the Aircraft in
accordance with the procedure described in
Article 10 hereof, the Aircraft shall be sold
within 90 days after the earlier of (1) the date
it is determined that the loss of the
airworthiness certificate is not curable, (2) the
date twelve (12) months after the airworthiness
certificate is lost, or (3) 90 days prior to the
end of the Term, in each case, in accordance with
the procedure set forth in Section 10.01(b)
hereof (except that the Lessee shall have no
right to rescind such termination procedure
(unless the loss of airworthiness certification
shall have been cured) and the Lessee shall
accept the highest bid thereunder without regard
to whether such bid is less than Termination
Value) and the Lessee shall make the payments set
forth in Section 10.01(c) hereof, and on the date
of such sale this Lease shall (subject to the
conditions specified in Article 10 hereof)
terminate; and provided, that this Lease shall
continue in full force and effect until the
Aircraft is sold according to such procedures and
nothing in this Section 7.01(b) shall or shall be
deemed to limit in any respect the Lessee's
obligations under Article 12 hereof or under any
other Operative Agreement;

(c) maintain, or cause to be maintained, all
records, logs and other materials in respect of
the Aircraft required by the Aeronautics
Authority, or the applicable regulatory agency or
body of any other jurisdiction in which the
Aircraft may then be registered, all such records
and logs to be maintained in the English
language, to the extent required by the Federal
Aviation Act (which records, logs and other
materials shall, as between the Lessor and the
Lessee and all parties claiming through the
Lessee, be the property of the Lessor but shall
become the property of the Lessee upon purchase
by the Lessee of the Aircraft pursuant to the
terms of this Lease or upon the occurrence of an
Event of Loss and the Lessee's compliance with
Section 11.02 hereof);

(d) promptly furnish to the Lessor such
information within the Lessee's possession as may
be required to enable the Lessor to file any
reports to be filed by the Lessor with any
governmental authority because of the Lessor's
ownership of or the Owner Participant's or the
Indenture Trustee's interest in the Aircraft;

(e) not maintain, use or operate the
Aircraft or any Engine in violation of any
airworthiness certificate or registration
relating thereto, or in violation of any law or
any license, rule, regulation or order of or by
any government or governmental authority having
jurisdiction over the Lessee or the Aircraft or
any Engine or any manufacturer's operation manual
or instruction or service bulletin relating to
the Airframe or any Engine or for any purpose for
which the Aircraft is not designed; provided,
however, that the Lessee may in good faith (after
having delivered to the Lessor a certificate
signed by an authorized officer of the Lessee
stating the relevant facts) contest the validity
or application of any such law, license, rule,
regulation or order in any manner that does not
in the Lessor's opinion, involve any risk of
liabilities or civil penalties or criminal
penalties being imposed on or against the Owner
Participant, the Indenture Trustee or the Lessor,
that does not involve any material risk of loss
or forfeiture of the Aircraft or any Engine and
that does not materially adversely affect the
Lessor, its title or interest in such Aircraft or
any Engine, or the interests of the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Participant; and if any such
law, license, rule, regulation or order requires
alteration of the Aircraft or any Engine, the
Lessee will conform therewith at its expense and
will maintain the Aircraft and the Engines in
proper operating condition under such law,
license, rule, regulation or order; and

(f) not operate or locate the Aircraft or
any Engine, or suffer the Aircraft or any Engine
to be operated or located, (i) in any area
excluded from coverage by an insurance policy in
effect with respect to the Aircraft and each
Engine required by the terms of Article 13
hereof, except in the case of a requisition for
use by the Government where the Lessee has
obtained (and furnished the Lessor with
satisfactory evidence of its having obtained)
prior to the operation or location of the
Airframe or any Engine in such area,
indemnification or insurance in lieu of such
indemnification from the Government against the
risks and in the amounts required by, and
otherwise in compliance with, Article 13 hereof
covering such operation or location in such area,
or (ii) in areas that are war zones or
recognized, or, in the Lessee's reasonable
judgment, threatened areas of hostilities
(including any area of the United States of
America which becomes such an area), unless fully
covered by international war-risk and allied
perils insurance coverage including hijacking
(air piracy) and non-Government confiscation and
expropriation insurance) or unless the Aircraft
is operated or used under contract with the
Government under which contract the Government
assumes liability for any damage, loss,
destruction or failure to return possession of
the Aircraft at the end of the term of the
contract and for injury to persons or damage to
properties of others, in either case in the
amounts required by Article 13 hereof, and the
Lessee shall have furnished the Lessor with
satisfactory evidence thereof.

Section 7.02. Possession and Permitted
Transfer and Sublease. (a) Conditions. The Lessee
will not, without the prior written consent of the
Lessor, sublease or otherwise in any manner deliver,
transfer or relinquish possession of the Aircraft, the
Airframe or any Engine or install any Engine, or
permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe
other than the Airframe; provided, that, so long as
(i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, and (ii) the Lessee shall comply with the
provisions of Article 13 hereof, the Lessee may
without the prior written consent of the Lessor and

Lessor as evidenced by its prior written consent;
provided, that, (i) with respect to clauses (B)
and (C) above, at the time of any such sublease
the United States of America maintains normal and
full diplomatic relations with the country in
which such Air Carrier is principally based and
domiciled and (ii) any such Air Carrier to which
the Aircraft is proposed to be subleased shall
operate the Aircraft under a maintenance program
where standards are at least equal to those
specified for similar aircraft with similar
engines by one of the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Directoire Generale de
l'Aviation Civile of the French Republic, the
Luftfahrt Bundesamt of the Federal Republic of
Germany or the Civil Aviation Authority of the
United Kingdom. In the case of any sublease (x)
such sublease shall include the provisions
required by Section 7.02(b) hereof and expressly
require the sublessee to operate and maintain the
Aircraft in compliance with the applicable
provisions of this Lease, (y) such sublease shall

person without the prior written consent of the
Lessor (except as permitted by subparagraphs (ii)
through (viii) below) and (z) such sublease shall
expire not later than 180 days prior to the
expiration of the Basic Term or the Renewal Term,
if any. In addition, prior to entering into any
such sublease under clause (C) of this Section
7.02(a)(i), the Lessee will provide opinions of
counsel (such counsel and the form of such
opinions to be reasonably satisfactory to the
Lessor and the Indenture Trustee) to the effect
that (1) the Operative Agreements and the
sublease will constitute legal, valid and
enforceable obligations of the parties thereto
under the laws of such country (including without
limitation the provisions thereof required by
Section 7.02(b) below), (2) it is not necessary
for the Owner Participant, the Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee to register or qualify to do
business in such country as a result of the
proposed sublease or in order for the Owner
Participant, the Lessor or the Indenture Trustee
to enforce the terms and conditions of the
Operative Agreements, (3) the laws of such
country require fair compensation by the
government of such country payable in a currency
freely convertible into U.S. Dollars for the loss
of the use of or title to the Airframe or any
Engine in the event of a requisition of use or
title by such government, (4) the Lessor's title
to the subleased equipment will be recognized,
(5) there is no tort liability of the owner of an
aircraft not in possession thereof or of persons
lending money to such an owner for the purchase
of an aircraft, under the laws of such
jurisdiction other than tort liability which
might have been imposed on such owner or persons
under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof (it being understood that, in the event
that such latter opinion cannot be given in a
form satisfactory to the Lessor, such opinion
shall be waived if insurance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessor is available to cover
such risk and is provided at or before the
execution of such a sublease, at the Lessee's
cost and expense), (6) the required agreement of
such foreign air carrier that its rights under
the sublease are subject and subordinate to all
the terms of this Lease is enforceable against

(subject only to customary exceptions to
enforceability), (7) the remedies provisions of
this Lease are enforceable against the Lessee
notwithstanding such sublease or any bankruptcy
proceedings involving the sublessee and (8) none
of the Owner Participant, the Lessor, or the
Indenture Trustee will suffer any unindemnified
adverse tax consequences as a result of such
sublease;

(ii) subject the Airframe or permit the
Airframe to be subjected to normal interchange
agreements or subject the Engines or permit any
Engine to be subjected to normal interchange or
pooling agreements or arrangements, in each case
customary in the airline industry, entered into
by the Lessee in the ordinary course of its
business with a vendor domiciled in the United
States or in a country with which the United
States maintains "normal" diplomatic relations
(other than in the case of Taiwan, in which case
relations as in effect on the Commencement Date
shall be acceptable), or; (x) any United States
Air Carrier certificated under Section 401 of the
Act or any successor provision or (y) any
"foreign air carrier" (as such term is defined in
the Act) which is (I) organized in a country
listed on Schedule III to the Participation
Agreement, (II) organized in a country with which
the United States then maintains "normal"
diplomatic relations (other than in the case of
Taiwan, in which case relations as in effect on
the Commencement Date shall be acceptable), (III)
is a party to the Geneva Convention or (IV)
otherwise provides equivalent protection to
owners, lessors and mortgagees of aircraft;
provided that no transfer of the registration of
the Airframe or any Engine shall be effected and
that throughout the period that the Airframe or
any Engine is subjected to such interchange or
pooling agreement or arrangement the terms of
this Lease shall be observed; and provided,
further, that no such agreement or arrangement
contemplates or requires the transfer of title to
or registration of the Airframe or any Engine,
and if the Lessor's title to any Engine shall
nonetheless be divested under any such agreement
or arrangement, such divestiture shall be deemed

this Lease in respect of such Engine;

(iii) deliver or permit the delivery of
possession of the Airframe or any Engine to their

to a contract or agreement with the Government or
pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
("CRAF Program") administered pursuant to

similar or substitute programs, so long as the
Lessee (or any permitted sublessee or transferee
pursuant to this Section) shall promptly notify
the Lessor upon such transfer of possession and
provide the Indenture Trustee with the name and
address of the Contracting Officer or
representative of the Military Aircraft Command
of the United States Air Force to whom notices
must be given in respect of the Aircraft,
provided, that if such transfer of possession
continues beyond the end of the Basic Term or the
Renewal Term, the Basic Term or the Renewal Term,

(including the obligation to pay Rent per diem
during such extension at a rate equal to the Fair
Market Rental) for up to six (6) months after the
end of the Term;

which apply only to the engines (other than an
Engine), appliances, parts, instruments,
appurtenances, accessories, furnishings and other
equipment (other than Parts) installed on such
airframe and which do not apply to substantially
all of such airframe and (C) the rights of an Air
Carrier under normal interchange or pooling
agreements which are customary in the airline
industry and do not contemplate or require the
transfer of title to such airframe or the engines
installed on it;

(vi) install or permit the installation of
an Engine on an airframe leased to the Lessee or
any permitted sublessee or transferee or
purchased by the Lessee subject to a conditional
sale or other security agreement, provided that
(A) such lease, conditional sale or other
security agreement does not cover the Engine so
installed and the Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee shall have received from the lessor,
conditional vendor or secured party of such
airframe an agreement (which may be the lease or
conditional sale or other security agreement
covering such airframe), whereby such lessor,
conditional vendor or secured party expressly
agrees that neither it nor its successors or
assigns will acquire or claim any right, title or
interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine
being installed on such airframe at any time, and
(B) such airframe is and remains free and clear
of all Liens except the rights of the parties to
the lease or conditional sale or other security
agreement covering such airframe and Liens of the
type permitted by subparagraph (v) of this
Section 7.02(a);

(vii) install or permit the installation of an
Engine on an airframe owned by the Lessee, leased
to the Lessee or purchased by the Lessee subject
to a conditional sale or other security agreement
under circumstances where neither subparagraph
(v) nor subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7.02(a)
is applicable, provided that such installation
shall be deemed an Event of Loss with respect to
such Engine and the Lessee shall comply with
Section 11.04 hereof in respect of such Engine,
the Lessor not intending to waive any right,
title or interest it may have to or in such
Engine under applicable law until compliance by
the Lessee with such Section 11.04; and

(viii) enter into a wet lease under which the
Lessee has effective control of the Aircraft in
the ordinary course of the Lessee's business
which shall not be considered a transfer of
possession hereunder, provided that the Lessee's
obligations under this Lease shall continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding any such
wet lease.

(b) Rights of Transferee. Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 7.02(a) hereof, the rights
of any transferee who takes possession of the
Aircraft, the Airframe or any Engine by reason of a
transfer permitted by Section 7.02(a) hereof shall be
subject and subordinate to, and any sublease or wet
lease permitted by Section 7.02(a) hereof shall be
made expressly subject and subordinate to, all the
terms of this Lease, including, without limitation,
the Lessor's right to repossession pursuant to Article
17 hereof and to avoid such sublease upon such
repossession, and the Lessee shall remain primarily
liable for the performance of all the terms of this
Lease to the same extent as if such sublease or
transfer had not occurred. Any such sublease shall
include appropriate provisions for the maintenance,
inspection (as required by Section 14.01 hereof) and
insurance of the Aircraft, the Airframe and each
Engine in accordance with the provisions of this Lease
and shall provide assurances reasonably satisfactory
to the Lessor that the sublessee may not further
sublease any of such equipment. The Lessee shall
notify the Lessor, the Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee of any sublease of the Airframe at
least 15 days before the execution and delivery

Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee within 15
days after execution and delivery thereof a copy of
any sublease which has a term in excess of six (6)
months and shall deliver a copy of any other sublease
promptly after a request therefor from any such party
and, prior to execution and delivery of any sublease
deliver to Lessor all other documents required
hereunder relating to such sublease or transfer of
possession.

Subleasing. No sublease, interchange or pooling
agreement or other relinquishment of possession
permitted under this Article 7 of the Aircraft, the
Airframe or any Engine shall in any way discharge or
diminish any of the Lessee's obligations to the

under this Lease, the Participation Agreement or the
Tax Indemnity Agreement, or constitute a waiver of any
of the Lessor's rights and remedies hereunder or
thereunder or extend beyond the end of the Term
(except as provided in Section 7.02(a)(iv) hereof).
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease, the
Lessee will retain the right to cure any default by
any sublessee permitted pursuant to this Section 7.02

Lessee shall pay all costs of the Lessor, the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee incurred in
connection with any subleasing or proposed subleasing.

Section 7.03. Insignia. (a) Nameplate. On
or prior to the Commencement Date of the Aircraft or
as soon thereafter as possible, the Lessee agrees to
affix to and maintain in the cockpit of the Airframe,
in a clearly visible location, and on each Engine, a
clearly visible metal nameplate bearing the
inscription "FIRST SECURITY BANK OF UTAH, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, AS OWNER TRUSTEE, OWNER AND LESSOR," and,
so long as the Airframe or any Engine shall be subject
to the Lien of the Indenture the additional
inscription "NATIONSBANK OF GEORGIA, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE, MORTGAGEE."

(b) Lessee's Marks. Except as provided in
clause (a) above, the Lessee will not allow the name
of any Person to be placed on the Airframe or on any
Engine as a designation that might be interpreted as a
claim of ownership; provided, that during the Term,
the Lessee may cause such Aircraft to be lettered
"Federal Express Corporation" or may letter, paint or
mark it in some other appropriate manner for
convenience of identification of the Lessee's interest
or the interest of any permitted sublessee (including
but not limited to the Lessee's or any permitted
sublessee's customary colors and insignia) and to bear
insignia plates or other markings identifying the
supplier or manufacturer of the Airframe or the
Engines or any Parts of either.

ARTICLE 8

REPLACEMENT AND POOLING OF PARTS

Section 8.01. Replacement of Parts. (a)
Generally. The Lessee, at its own cost and expense,
will replace or cause to be replaced as promptly as
practicable all Parts which may from time to time be
incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or any Engine and which may from time to time
become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently
rendered unfit for use for any reason, except as
otherwise provided in Section 9.01 or 9.02 hereof. In
addition, the Lessee may, at its own cost and expense,
remove or cause to be removed in the ordinary course
of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing,
any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen,
destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair
or permanently rendered unfit for use, provided that
the Lessee, except as otherwise provided in Sections
9.01 or 9.02 hereof, will, at its own cost and
expense, replace such Parts as promptly as
practicable. All replacement Parts shall be free and
clear of Liens (except for pooling arrangements to the
extent permitted by Section 8.02 hereof and Liens
permitted under Section 6.01(a),(b),(c),(d) and (f)
hereof) and shall be in at least as good operating
condition as, and shall have a value and utility at
least equal to, the Parts replaced, and in any event
not less than the condition and repair required to be
maintained by the provisions of this Lease.

(b) Title. All Parts at any time removed
from the Airframe or any Engine shall remain the
property of the Lessor until such Parts shall be
replaced by Parts which have been incorporated or
installed in or attached to the Airframe or such
Engine and which meet the requirements for replacement
Parts specified in Section 8.01(a) hereof.
Immediately upon any replacement Part (other than, to
the extent permitted by Section 8.02 hereof, a
replacement Part subject to a pooling arrangement)
becoming incorporated or installed in or attached to
the Airframe or any Engine, and without further act:

(i) title to the replaced Part shall vest in
the Lessee, free and clear of all rights of the
Lessor, and such replaced Part shall no longer be
deemed a Part under this Lease;

(ii) title to such replacement Part shall
vest in the Lessor free and clear of all Liens
except for Liens permitted by Section 6.01(a),
(b), (c), (d) and (f) hereof; and

(iii) such replacement Part shall become
subject to this Lease and to the Lien of the
Indenture and shall be deemed part of the
Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the
same extent as the Parts originally incorporated
or installed in or attached to the Airframe or
such Engine.

Section 8.02. Pooling of Parts. Any Part
removed from the Airframe or any Engine as permitted
in Section 8.01(a) hereof may be subjected by the
Lessee to any normal pooling arrangement customary in
the airline industry and entered into with vendors and
other Air Carriers in the ordinary course of the
Lessee's business, provided that the Part replacing
such removed Part shall be incorporated or installed
in or attached to the Airframe or such Engine in
accordance with Section 8 hereof, as promptly as
practicable after the removal of such removed Part.
In addition, any replacement Part when incorporated or
installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine
in accordance with Section 8.01(a) hereof may be owned
by another Air Carrier subject to such normal pooling
arrangement, provided that the Lessee, at its own cost
and expense and as promptly as possible, either:

(a) causes title to such replacement Part to
vest in the Lessor in accordance with Section
8.01(b) hereof by the Lessee acquiring title to
such replacement Part for the benefit of, and
transferring such title to, the Lessor free and
clear of all Liens (other than Liens permitted
under Section 6.01(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f)
hereof); or

(b) replaces such replacement Part by
incorporating or installing in or attaching to
the Airframe or such Engine a further replacement
Part owned by the Lessee free and clear of all
Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section
6.01(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) hereof) and by
causing title to such further replacement Part to
vest in the Lessor in accordance with Section
8.01(b) hereof.

All such replacement Parts and further
replacement Parts shall meet the standards set forth
in the last sentence of Section 8.01(a) hereof.

ARTICLE 9

ALTERATIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONS

Section 9.01. Required Alterations and
Modifications. The Lessee, at its own cost and
expense, shall make or cause to be made such
alterations and modifications in and additions to the
Airframe and each Engine as may be required from time
to time to meet the applicable requirements of the
Aeronautics Authority or any other governmental
authority with jurisdiction over the Lessee's
operations and aircraft; provided, however, that the
Lessee may in good faith (after having delivered to
the Lessor a certificate signed by an authorized
officer of the Lessee stating the relevant facts)
contest the validity or application of any such
requirement in any manner that does not, in the
Lessor's opinion, involve any risk of liabilities or
civil penalties or criminal penalties being imposed on
or against the Owner Participant, the Indenture
Trustee or the Lessor, that does not involve any
material risk of loss or forfeiture of the Aircraft or
any Engine and that does not materially adversely
affect the Lessor, its title or interest in such
Aircraft or any Engine, or the interests of the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Participant; and if any
such requirement requires alteration of the Aircraft
or any Engine, the Lessee will conform therewith at
its expense and will maintain the Aircraft and the
Engines in proper operating condition under such
requirement. All such alterations, modifications or
additions required to be made under this Section 9.01
shall be made on or before the date mandated therefor,
taking into account postponements resulting from a
contest or otherwise and shall be made at such time
and in such a manner so as not to discriminate against
the Aircraft whether by reason of its leased status or
otherwise. Title to all alterations, modifications
and additions made pursuant to this Section 9.01 shall
without further act vest in the Lessor and become
subject to this Lease.

Section 9.02. Other Alterations and
Modifications. (a) Generally. The Lessee, at its
own cost and expense, may from time to time make such
alterations and modifications in and additions to the
Airframe or any Engine as the Lessee may deem
desirable in the proper conduct of its business,
including, without limitation, removal of Obsolete
Parts, provided that no such alteration, modification,
addition or removal, individually or in the aggregate,
shall create any adverse tax consequences for the
Owner Participant not otherwise indemnified for,
diminish the value, useful life, or utility of the
Airframe or the value and utility of any Engine or
impair its condition or airworthiness below its value,
useful life (in the case of the Airframe only),
utility, condition and airworthiness immediately prior
to such alteration, modification, addition or removal,
assuming that the Airframe or such Engine was then in
the condition and airworthiness required to be
maintained by the terms of this Lease, or cause the
Airframe or any Engine to become "limited use
property" within the meaning of Revenue Procedure
76-30, 1976-2 C.B. 647.

(b) Title to Installed Parts. Title to each
Part incorporated or installed in or attached or added
to the Airframe or any Engine as the result of any
alteration, modification, removal or addition made
pursuant to Section 9.02(a) hereof shall without
further act vest in the Lessor and become subject to
this Lease; provided, however, that the Lessee may
remove any such Part at any time during the Term if:

(i) such Part is in addition to, and not in
replacement of or substitution for, any Part
originally incorporated or installed in or
attached or added to the Airframe or such Engine
on the Commencement Date or any Part in
replacement of, or substitution for, any such
Part;

(ii) such Part is not required to be
incorporated or installed in or attached or added
to the Airframe or such Engine pursuant to the
terms of Article 7 hereof or the first sentence
of Section 9.01 hereof;

(iii) such Part can be removed from the
Airframe or such Engine without (A) causing
material damage to the Airframe or such Engine
(it being understood that the Lessee shall repair
any damage caused by a permitted removal) or
diminishing or impairing the value, utility,
condition or airworthiness required to be
maintained by the terms of this Lease or (B)
diminishing the value, utility or remaining
useful life (in the case of the Airframe) or the
value and utility (in the case of such Engine)
which the Airframe or such Engine would have had
at such time had such alteration, modification,
removal or addition not occurred, assuming the
Airframe or such Engine was then in the condition
required to be maintained by the terms of this
Lease; and

(iv) the cost of such Part was not paid by
the Lessor.

(c) Title to Removed Parts. Upon the
removal by the Lessee of any such Part as provided in
subsection (b) above, title thereto shall, without
further act, vest in the Lessee and such Part shall no
longer be deemed a Part. Any Part not removed by the
Lessee as above provided prior to the return of the
applicable Aircraft to the Lessor hereunder shall
remain the property of the Lessor and subject to this
Lease.

ARTICLE 10

VOLUNTARY TERMINATION

Section 10.01. Right of Termination Upon
Obsolescence or Surplus. (a) Option to Terminate.
So long as no Event of Default or Payment Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee
shall have the right, at its option, on any
Termination Date, on at least 180 days' prior written
notice (which notice shall state the Proposed
Termination Date) to the Lessor, the Indenture Trustee
and the Owner Participant (or, in the circumstances
described in Section 7.01(b) hereof, the Lessee shall
have the obligation on not more than 90 days' prior
written notice) to terminate this Lease as of a
Termination Date (or within such 90-day period) if the
Aircraft shall have become obsolete or surplus to the
operations of the Lessee; provided that the Lessee
shall have furnished to the Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Participant a certificate of
the Lessee's President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Treasurer
or Assistant Treasurer stating the determination
of Lessee that the Aircraft is obsolete or surplus to
its needs or that the Lessee has given such notice
pursuant to Section 7.01(b) hereof. Unless the Lessor
has elected to retain the Aircraft as herein provided
or the Lessee has given such notice pursuant to Section
7.01(b) hereof, the Lessee shall have one right to revoke
its notice of termination not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Proposed Termination Date whereupon
this Lease shall continue in full force and effect;
provided that the Lessee may not deliver another
notice of termination within one year after revocation
of the prior notice, and provided further that the
Lessee may not revoke its notice if a cash bid which
is for an amount greater than or equal to Termination
Value has been submitted for the purchase of the
Aircraft.

(b) Sale Procedure. During the period from
the giving of notice pursuant to Section 10.01(a)
until the Proposed Termination Date, the Lessee, as
non-exclusive agent for the Lessor, shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain bids for the cash
purchase on the Proposed Termination Date (or such
earlier date as shall be consented to in writing by
the Lessor) of such Aircraft. On the Termination
Date, the Engines shall be installed on the Airframe
(provided that the Airframe may be sold with engines
meeting the requirements set forth herein for
Replacement Engines in lieu of the Engines so long as
the aggregate number of Engines and Replacement
Engines being sold with the Airframe equals two). The
Lessor may, if it desires to do so, seek to obtain
such bids. The Owner Participant shall not inspect
any bids received by the Lessee, unless the Owner
Participant has given to the Lessee binding and
irrevocable notice that neither the Owner Participant
nor any of its Affiliates nor any Person acting for
the Owner Participant or such Affiliate will submit a
bid for the purchase of the Aircraft and if such
notice has been given, the Lessee will provide the
Lessor with copies of bids received by the Lessee. No
bid may be submitted by the Lessee or any Person, firm
or corporation affiliated with the Lessee (or with
whom or which there is any arrangement or
understanding as to the subsequent use of the Aircraft
by the Lessee or any of its Affiliates) or any agent
or person acting on behalf of the Lessee. The Lessee
may reject any bid which is less than the applicable
Termination Value unless the sale is being made
pursuant to a notice given in accordance with Section
7.01(b) hereof. Subject to the provisions of Section
10.02 hereof, on the Proposed Termination Date or such
earlier date of sale as shall be consented to in
writing by the Lessor, the Lessee shall deliver the
Airframe which shall have the Engines installed on it
(provided that the Airframe may be delivered with
installed engines meeting the requirements set forth
herein for Replacement Engines in lieu of the Engines
so long as the aggregate number of Engines and
Replacement Engines being delivered with the Airframe
equals two and the Lessee shall comply with the
provisions of Section 11.04 hereof as if an Event of
Loss occurred with regard to the Engines) to the
bidder which shall have submitted the highest cash bid
(whether certified to the Lessor by the Lessee or
directly received by the Lessor and certified to the
Lessee, it being understood, however, that all bidders
shall be required to make payments directly to the
Lessor) in the same manner as if delivery were made to
the Lessor pursuant to Article 12 hereof, at a
location specified by such bidder, and shall duly
transfer to the Lessor title to any such engines not
owned by the Lessor, and the Lessor shall, upon
payment in full of the bid price and all amounts due
and owing pursuant to Section 10.01(c) hereof by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, sell the
Airframe and Engines or engines to such bidder without
recourse or warranty (except as to the absence of
Lessor's Liens).

(c) Payments to the Lessor. The total
selling price realized at a sale of the Aircraft
pursuant to Section 10.01(b) hereof net of all
expenses of the sale (including commissions and any
sales or transfer taxes) (the "Net Sales Price") shall
be retained by the Lessor (or the Indenture Trustee,
as long as the Indenture is in force) and, in
addition, on or before the Proposed Termination Date
(or any earlier date of sale), the Lessee shall pay to
the Lessor (or the Indenture Trustee, as long as the
Indenture is in force), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the sum of:

(i) the excess, if any, of the Termination
Value for the Aircraft computed as of the
Termination Date over the Net Sales Price
therefor; plus

(ii) all other amounts then due and payable
by the Lessee under this Lease or any other
Operative Agreement (including any Make-Whole
Premium payable pursuant to the Indenture).

(d) Transfer of Uninstalled Engines. Upon
payment of the amounts described in Section 10.01(c)
hereof and upon transfer to the Lessor of title to
engines which have been returned in lieu of Engines as
provided in Section 10.01(b) hereof, and upon payment
of all other amounts then due under this Lease, the
Lessor will transfer to the Lessee, without recourse
or warranty (except as to the absence of Lessor's
Liens), all of the Lessor's right, title and interest
in and to any Engines which were replaced with engines
pursuant to Section 10.01(b) hereof, and shall deliver
to the Lessee, at the Lessee's cost, such instrument
as the Lessor shall have received from the Indenture
Trustee, releasing such Engines from the Lien of the
Indenture.

(e) Limitation on the Lessor's Duties. The
Lessor shall be under no duty to solicit bids, to
inquire into the efforts of the Lessee to obtain bids
or otherwise to take any action in connection with any
such sale other than to transfer to the purchaser
named in the highest cash bid as referred to above (or
to such purchaser and to the Lessee, as the case may
be), without recourse or warranty (except as to the
absence of Lessor's Liens), all of the Lessor's right,
title and interest in and to the Aircraft, against
receipt by the Lessor of the payments provided for.

(f) Termination of the Lessee's Obligations.
Upon the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to this Section
10.01 and upon compliance by the Lessee with the
further provisions of this Article 10, the obligation
of the Lessee to pay Basic Rent shall cease for any
Rent Payment Date occurring after the Termination
Date and the Term shall end effective as of the
Termination Date. If no sale shall have
occurred on or before the Proposed Termination Date,
this Lease shall continue in full force and effect
and, for purposes of Section 10.01(a) hereof, it shall
be deemed that the Lessee has rescinded its notice of
termination, and the Lessee shall pay the expenses
incurred by the Lessor, the Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee in connection with the proposed
sale.

Section 10.02. Retention of the Aircraft by
the Lessor. (a) Generally. Notwithstanding Section
10.01, the Lessor may, subject to Section 10.02(b)
hereof, elect to retain the Aircraft after receipt of
the Lessee's notice of termination given in accordance
with Section 10.01(a), by giving the Lessee and the
Indenture Trustee written irrevocable notice of such
election not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
Proposed Termination Date. If the Lessor so elects,
the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on the Proposed
Termination Date, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds all amounts then due and payable by
the Lessee under this Lease and any other Operative
Agreement on or prior to the Termination Date
(including any Make-Whole Premium payable pursuant to
the Indenture).

(b) Payment of the Certificates. It shall
be an absolute condition precedent to the Lessor's
right to retain the Aircraft and to the termination of
the Term pursuant to this Section 10.02 that the
Lessor (or the Lessee to the extent set forth in
Section 10.02(a)) shall have paid to the Holders of
the Certificates and such Holders shall have received
the entire outstanding principal amount of and accrued
interest on the Certificates on the Termination Date
and all other sums due and owing to the Indenture
Trustee and the Holders of the Certificates (including
any Make-Whole Premium payable pursuant to the
Indenture) on or prior to the Termination Date under
this Lease, the Indenture or any other Operative
Agreement. If the condition precedent set forth in
this Section 10.02(b) is not satisfied on any
Termination Date, the Lease shall continue in full
force and effect with respect to the Aircraft (and the
Lessee's notice of termination referred to in Section
10.02(a) hereof shall be deemed revoked).

(c) Delivery of Aircraft to Lessor; Title to
Engines. If the Lessor elects to retain such Aircraft
pursuant to this Section 10.02, the Lessee shall
deliver the Airframe and the Engines (provided that
the Airframe may be delivered with engines meeting the
requirements set forth herein for Replacement Engines
in lieu of the Engines so long as the aggregate number
of Engines and engines being delivered with the
Airframe equals two and provided that the other
requirements of Section 11.04 hereof are met as if an
Event of Loss has occurred with regard to the Engines)
to the Lessor in the same manner as if delivery were
made to the Lessor pursuant to Article 12 hereof, and
shall duly transfer to the Lessor right, title and
interest to any such engines not owned by the Lessor,
all in accordance with Article 12 hereof. Upon such
delivery of the Airframe and the Engines or engines to
the Lessor and payment by the Lessee of any amounts
required to be paid by the Lessee pursuant to Section
10.02(a) hereof, the Lessor will transfer to the
Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to the
absence of Lessor's Liens), all of the Lessor's right,
title and interest in and to any Engines which were
replaced by engines pursuant to this Section 10.02(c),
and shall deliver to the Lessee such instrument as the
Lessor shall have received from the Indenture Trustee
releasing such Engines from the Lien of the Indenture.

(d) Termination of the Lessee's Obligations.
Upon compliance by the Lessor and the Lessee with the
provisions of this Section 10.02 and upon compliance
by the Lessee with the further provisions of this
Article 10, the obligation of the Lessee to pay Basic
Rent shall cease for any Rent Payment Date occurring
on or after the Termination Date and the Term shall
end effective as of the Termination Date.

Section 10.03. Voluntary Termination as to
Engines. So long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Lessee shall have the
right at its option and at any time, on at least sixty
(60) days' prior written notice to the Lessor, to
terminate this Lease with respect to any Engine not
then installed or held for use on the Airframe,
provided that prior to the date of such termination,
the Lessee shall comply with the terms of Section
11.04 hereof to the same extent as if an Event of Loss
had occurred with respect to such Engine.

ARTICLE 11

LOSS, DESTRUCTION, REQUISITION

Section 11.01. Lessee's Notification
Responsibility. The Lessee shall notify the Lessor,
the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee as
soon as practicable but in no event more than five (5)
Business Days following the occurrence of an event
which constitutes or might constitute an Event of Loss
with respect to the Airframe or with respect to the
Airframe and the Engines or engines then installed on
the Airframe.

Section 11.02. Payment of Stipulated Loss
Value. (a) If an Event of Loss has occurred, the
Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds on the earlier of (i) the
fifth Business Day following receipt in full of
insurance proceeds or requisition proceeds, described
in Section 11.05 hereof, in connection with such Event
of Loss and (ii) the 90th day after the occurrence of
such Event of Loss (the earlier of such dates being
referred to herein as the "Loss Payment Date"), the
sum of (A) the Stipulated Loss Value, determined as of
the Stipulated Loss Value Determination Date next
preceding the Loss Payment Date (or, if the Loss
Payment Date occurs on a Stipulated Loss Value
Determination Date, determined as of such Stipulated
Loss Value Determination Date), together with interest
on such amount at the Debt Rate from such Stipulated
Loss Value Determination Date to the Loss Payment
Date, plus (B) any and all Basic Rent due and payable
on or prior to the relevant Stipulated Loss Value
Determination Date and unpaid, plus (C) any and all
Supplemental Rent due and payable on or prior to such
Loss Payment Date and all other amounts owing by the
Lessor to the Indenture Trustee or to the Holders
under the Indenture and the other Operative Agreements
plus (D) any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with such Event of Loss and the
related prepayment of the Certificates by the Lessor,
the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee.

(b) Termination of Lease; Title Transfer.
Upon payment in full of the amounts due pursuant to
Section 11.02(a) hereof, the obligation of the Lessee
to pay Basic Rent on any Rent Payment Date occurring
subsequent to the payment of such amounts shall
terminate and the Term shall end. Further, upon such
payment, the Lessor will transfer to the Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to the absence
of Lessor's Liens) and subject to the disclaimers set
forth in Section 5.01 hereof, all of the Lessor's
right, title and interest, in and to the Airframe,
Engines and engines, if any, with respect to which
such Event of Loss occurred, as well as all of the
Lessor's right, title and interest in and to any
Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but not
installed on the Airframe when such Event of Loss
occurred. In connection with such transfer, the
Lessee shall prepare and the Lessor shall execute or
arrange for the execution of a bill of sale evidencing
such transfer and any other document reasonably deemed
by the parties to be necessary to convey such right,
title and interest to the Lessee and, if applicable,
the Lessor will deliver to the Lessee such instrument
as the Lessor shall have received from the Indenture
Trustee releasing the Aircraft from the Lien of the
Indenture.

Section 11.03. [Intentionally Omitted]

Section 11.04. Event of Loss with Respect to
an Engine. (a) Generally. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under
circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event
of Loss with respect to the Airframe, the Lessee shall
give the Lessor and the Indenture Trustee prompt
written notice thereof and shall, as soon as
practicable but in any event within sixty (60) days
after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, duly
convey or cause to be conveyed to the Lessor, a
replacement for the Engine with respect to which such
Event of Loss occurred, good and marketable title to a
Replacement Engine, free and clear of all Liens not
excepted in Section 6.01(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f)
hereof and having a value and utility at least equal
to, and being in as good operating condition as, the
Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss
occurred, assuming such Engine was of the value and
utility and in the condition and repair required by
the terms of this Lease immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Event of Loss, provided that after
any replacement both Engines shall be of identical
make and model. The standards set forth in this
Section with respect to Replacement Engines shall
apply upon any replacement or substitution of an
Engine with a Replacement Engine pursuant to any other
provision of this Lease.

(b) Conditions Precedent. Prior to or at
the time of any conveyance of an Engine pursuant to
Section 11.04(a) hereof, the Lessee, at its own cost
and expense will:

(i) furnish the Lessor with an original of,
and the Indenture Trustee with a copy of, a full
warranty bill of sale, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lessor, the Owner Participant
and the Indenture Trustee with respect to such
Replacement Engine together with an assignment in
form and substance satisfactory to the Lessor and
the Indenture Trustee of any and all
manufacturer's warranties applicable thereto and
a consent reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor
and the Indenture Trustee from such manufacturer
to such assignment;

(ii) cause a Lease Supplement covering such
Replacement Engine to be duly executed by the
Lessee and filed for recordation pursuant to the
Act, or the applicable laws, rules and
regulations of any other jurisdiction in which
the Aircraft may then be registered as permitted
by Section 6.02(b) of the Participation Agreement
and, if the Engine being replaced was registered
under the jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is
then registered, the Replacement Engine shall be
registered in the same fashion;

(iii) furnish the Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee with a certificate of the Lessee
certifying that such Replacement Engine has a
value and utility at least equal to, and is in as
good operating condition as, the Engine replaced,
assuming such Engine was in at least the
condition and repair required by the terms of
this Lease immediately prior to the occurrence of
such Event of Loss;

(iv) furnish the Lessor with such evidence
of compliance with the insurance provisions of
Article 13 hereof with respect to such
Replacement Engine as the Lessor or the Indenture
Trustee may reasonably request;

(v) provide the Owner Participant and the
Lessor with (A) an opinion of counsel selected by
the Owner Participant and reasonably acceptable
to the Lessee (which opinion shall be reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to the Owner
Participant and the Lessor) that it will suffer
no adverse tax consequences not otherwise
indemnified for as of the Commencement Date as a
result of such substitution or (B) an indemnity
reasonably acceptable to the Lessor against such
consequences;

(vi) comply with the provisions of the
Indenture relating to the replacement of Engines
upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss;

(vii) cause an Indenture Supplement with
respect to such Replacement Engine to be duly
executed by the Lessor and the Indenture Trustee
and recorded pursuant to the Act, or the
applicable laws, rules and regulations of any
other jurisdiction in which the Aircraft may be
registered as permitted by Section 6.02(b) of the
Participation Agreement in order that the
Indenture shall constitute a first and prior and
perfected Lien and security interest on and in
respect of such Replacement Engine;

(viii) take such other action, including the
filing with the Secretary of State of Utah of UCC
financing statements naming the Indenture Trustee
as Secured Party and with the Secretary of State
of Tennessee only a notice filing, as the Lessor
or the Indenture Trustee may reasonably request
in order that such Replacement Engine be duly and
properly titled in the Lessor, leased under this
Lease and subjected to the Lien of the Indenture
to the same extent as the replaced Engine;

(ix) furnish the Lessor, the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee with an
opinion (reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the Lessor, the Owner Participant
and the Indenture Trustee) of counsel to the
Lessee (which may be the Lessee's General
Counsel) addressed to the Indenture Trustee to
the effect that (A) the Lessor has good title to
such Replacement Engine, and (B) such Replacement
Engine has been validly subjected to the Lien of
the Indenture (with the effect and result that
the Indenture constitutes a first and prior
perfected security interest and Lien on such
Replacement Engine); and

(x) take such other action as the Indenture
Trustee may reasonably request in order that such
Replacement Engine be duly and properly subjected
to the Lien of the Indenture to the same extent
as the replaced Engine.

(c) Title Transfer. Upon compliance by the
Lessee with the terms of Sections 11.04(a) and (b)
hereof, the Lessor will transfer to the Lessee
(subject to any insurer's salvage rights), without
recourse or warranty (except as to the absence of
Lessor's Liens) and subject to the disclaimers set
forth in Section 5.01 hereof, all of the Lessor's
right, title and interest, if any, in and to the
Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss
occurred. In connection with such transfer, the
Lessee shall prepare and the Lessor shall execute or
forward to the Indenture Trustee for execution, as the
case may be, all in recordable form, a bill of sale
evidencing such transfer, a release from the Indenture
of the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss
occurred, such instrument, if any, as the Lessor shall
have received from the Indenture Trustee releasing
such Engine from the Lien of the Indenture and any
other document reasonably deemed by the parties to be
necessary to convey such right, title and interest to
the Lessee and to effect such release, all at the
Lessee's sole cost and expense. Each Replacement
Engine shall, after such conveyance, be deemed part of
the property leased under this Lease. An Event of
Loss covered by this Section 11.04 shall not result in
any change in Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or
Termination Values with respect to the corresponding
Aircraft, but may result in payments to be made
pursuant to the Tax Indemnity Agreement and the
Participation Agreement.

Section 11.05. Application of Payments from
the Government or Others. (a) Generally. Any
payments (other than insurance proceeds the
application of which is provided for in Section 13.03
hereof) received at any time by the Lessor or by the
Lessee from any governmental authority or any other
party, foreign or domestic, with respect to an Event
of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation,
theft or seizure of, or requisition of title to or use
of, the Airframe or any Engine will be applied, as
appropriate, in accordance with Section 11.05(b) or
Section 11.05(c) hereof.

(b) Payments of Stipulated Loss Value. If
the payments described in Section 11.05(a) hereof are
received with respect to the Airframe or with respect
to the Airframe and Engines or engines then installed
on such Airframe, so much of such payments as shall
not exceed the amount required to be paid by the
Lessee pursuant to Section 11.02 hereof shall be paid
to the Lessor in reduction of the Lessee's obligations
under Section 11.02 hereof if not already paid by the
Lessee, or, if such obligations have already been
discharged in full by the Lessee, such payments shall
be applied to reimburse the Lessee for its payment of
such Stipulated Loss Value and, if and to the extent
specifically included in such payment, to pay to the
Lessee interest on such amount of Stipulated Loss
Value at the rate included in such payment if any, or
otherwise at the applicable Debt Rate, for the period
from the date of payment by the Lessee of the
Stipulated Loss Value to the date of reimbursement of
the Lessee under this Section 11.05(b). The excess,
if any, remaining after such application shall be
divided between the Lessor and the Lessee as their
respective interests may appear.

(c) Payment upon Engine Replacement. If the
payments described in Section 11.05(a) hereof are
received with respect to an Engine not then installed
on the Airframe under the circumstances contemplated
by Section 11.04 hereof, all such payments shall,
subject to Section 11.08 hereof, be paid over to or
retained by the Lessee, provided that the Lessee shall
have fully performed its obligations pursuant to
Section 11.04 hereof with respect to the Event of Loss
for which such payments are made.

Section 11.06. Requisition of the Airframe
and the Installed Engines for Use by Government. In
the event of the requisition for use by the Government
or any other government of registry of the Aircraft,
or any agency or instrumentality of either (a
"Requisitioning Government") of the Airframe and the
Engines or engines then installed on the Airframe
during the Term, which requisition does not constitute
an Event of Loss, the Lessee shall promptly notify the
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee, and the Owner
Participant of such requisition and all of the
Lessee's obligations under this Lease shall continue
to the same extent as if such requisition had not
occurred except to the extent that any failure or
delay in the performance or observance of such
obligations (other than obligations for the payment of
Rent) by the Lessee shall have been caused by such
requisition. All payments received by the Lessor, the
Lessee or any permitted sublessee or transferee from
the Requisitioning Government for such use of the
Airframe and Engines or engines during the Term (other
than any such requisition which constitutes an Event
of Loss, as to which the provisions of Section 11.05
hereof shall govern) shall, subject to Section 11.08
hereof, be paid over to, or retained by the Lessee or
such permitted sublessee or transferee. All payments
received by the Lessor, the Lessee or any such
permitted sublessee or transferee from the
Requisitioning Government for the use of the Airframe
and Engines or engines after the Term shall be paid
over to, or retained by, the Lessor (or the Lessee if
it shall have purchased the Lessor's interest therein
in accordance with the provisions hereof). In the
event of any such requisition for use, the Lessee
agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain
reimbursement from the Requisitioning Government to
the Lessor for damages suffered by the Lessor or the
Owner Participant, with respect to which the Lessee is
not obligated to indemnify under the Operative
Agreements, as a result of such requisition for use.
The Lessee will endeavor to keep the Lessor informed
as to any negotiations between the Lessee and/or any
permitted sublessee or transferee and a Requisitioning
Government with respect to any such requisition and
will consult with the Lessor regarding methods or
procedures that are appropriate to effect recovery
from such Requisitioning Government for such damages.

Section 11.07. Requisition for Use by
Government of an Engine Not Installed on the Airframe.
In the event of the requisition for use by a
Requisitioning Government of registry of the Aircraft
or any agency or instrumentality thereof of any Engine
not then installed on the Airframe, the Lessee shall
replace such Engine by complying with the terms of
Section 11.04 hereof to the same extent as if an Event
of Loss had occurred with respect to such Engine as of
the date of such requisition, and any payments
received by the Lessor or the Lessee from the
Requisitioning Government with respect to such
requisition shall, subject to Section 11.08 hereof, be
paid over to or retained by the Lessee, provided that
the Lessee shall have fully performed its obligations
under Section 11.04 hereof.

Section 11.08. Application of Payments
During Existence of Certain Defaults. Any amount
referred to in Section 11.05, 11.06 or 11.07 hereof
which is payable to the Lessee shall not be paid to
the Lessee, or, if it has been previously paid
directly to the Lessee, shall not be retained by the
Lessee, if at the time of such payment a Payment
Default, Bankruptcy Default or an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall be
paid to and held by the Lessor (or the Indenture
Trustee so long as the Lien of the Indenture is in
effect) as provided in Article 23 hereof as security
for the obligations of the Lessee under this
Agreement, and at such time as there shall not be
continuing any such Payment Default, Bankruptcy
Default or Event of Default, such amount shall be paid
to the Lessee.

ARTICLE 12

RETURN OF AIRCRAFT

Section 12.01. Return of Aircraft. Unless
such Aircraft is purchased by the Lessee as provided
in Section 4.02 hereof, at the end of the Term, or
upon the termination of this Lease pursuant to Article
7, Article 10 or Article 17 hereof or otherwise
(including termination as a result of a rejection
hereof pursuant to any provision of the Bankruptcy
Code), the Lessee, at its own cost and expense, will
return the Aircraft by delivering it to the Lessor on
the last day of the Term (including the date specified
in any court order authorizing such a rejection) or on
the Termination Date, as the case may be, at the
Lessee's principal maintenance facility in Memphis,
Tennessee or such other location within the
continental United States (on the Lessee's route
structure as in effect on the return date) as
determined by the Lessee or such other location
mutually agreed upon by the Lessee and the Lessor, and
the Airframe shall be fully equipped with two Engines
of the same or an improved make and model as were
delivered on the Commencement Date (or Replacement
Engines), free and clear of all Liens (other than
Lessor's Liens), including any rights of third parties
under pooling, interchange, overhaul, repair or
similar agreement or arrangements, it being understood
that both such Engines and Replacement Engines so
returned shall be of identical make and model and that
any Replacement Engine shall be in at least as good
operating condition and have at least the same value
and utility as the Engines being replaced, assuming
such Engines were in the condition required hereunder.
The Lessee will give the Lessor at least thirty (30)
(or ten (10) in the case of a return pursuant to
Article 17 or in connection with such a rejection)
days prior written notice of the place of such return;
provided, however, that if the Lessor shall have made
the request for storage pursuant to Section 12.06
hereof, the Lessee shall return the Aircraft to the
Lessor at the site of the storage.

Section 12.02. Return of Engines. If either
engine not owned by the Lessor shall be delivered with
the Airframe as set forth in Section 12.01 hereof, the
Lessee, concurrently with such delivery, will, at its
own cost and expense furnish the Lessor with (i) a
full warranty bill of sale, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor, with respect to
such engine, (ii) an opinion of the Lessee's counsel
to the effect that, upon such return, the Lessor will
acquire full right, title and interest to such engine
free and clear of all Liens (other than Lessor's
Liens) and (iii) a certificate as described in Section
11.04(b)(iii) hereof. The Lessee shall take such
other action as the Lessor may reasonably request in
order that such Replacement Engine shall be duly and
properly titled in the Lessor free and clear of all
Liens (other than Lessor's Liens), and the Lessor will
then transfer to the Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to the absence of Lessor's Liens)
and subject to the disclaimers set forth in Section
5.01 hereof, all the Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engine in lieu of which a
Replacement Engine has been delivered pursuant to
Section 12.01 hereof, "as is, where is". In
connection with such transfer, the Lessee shall
prepare and the Lessor shall execute or arrange for
the execution of a bill of sale evidencing such
transfer and any other document reasonably deemed by
the parties to be necessary to convey such right,
title and interest to the Lessee and, if applicable,
the Lessor will deliver to the Lessee such instrument
as the Lessor shall have received from the Indenture
Trustee releasing the Aircraft from the Lien of the
Indenture.

Section 12.03. Return of Manuals. Upon the
return of the Aircraft, the Lessee shall deliver to
the Lessor (updated to reflect the actual
configuration of the Aircraft at the time of return)
all logs, manuals, certificates and data (to be in the
English language if necessary to permit the
registration of the Aircraft or as required by the
FAA), and inspection, modification and overhaul
records pertaining to the Airframe, Engines or
engines, which are then in the Lessee's possession and
reasonably required for the further sale or lease by
the Lessor of the Aircraft, Engines or engines or
which are required to be maintained with respect
thereto under applicable rules and regulations of the
Aeronautics Authority and under the rules of any other
government of registry.

Section 12.04. Condition of the Aircraft.
(a) Required Condition. The Aircraft when returned
to the Lessor shall, at the Lessee's own cost and
expense, meet the following requirements:

(i) it shall be duly registered in the name

the Lessor otherwise requests the Lessee to
retain the then-existing registration of the
Aircraft;

(ii) it shall be clean by airline and cargo
handling operating standards;

(iii) the Airframe shall be returned with the
Engines, or any replacements thereto as herein
authorized, provided that the Airframe shall have

the same make and model, installed thereon,
together with the equipment, accessories or parts
installed thereon on the Commencement Date or
replacements therefor (as herein authorized) and
alterations, modifications and additions thereto
made in accordance with the provisions of this
Lease;

(iv) it shall be in the condition required
by Section 7.01(b) hereof, and otherwise be in as
good condition as when delivered to the Lessee,
ordinary wear and tear excepted;

required by, the Aeronautics Authority (or any
government or governmental authority, domestic or
foreign, having jurisdiction over the Aircraft)
required to be terminated before the end of the
Term and each Engine (including any Replacement
Engine) shall be serviceable in accordance with
the Lessee's Aeronautics Authority approved
maintenance program;

(vii) it shall be free and clear of all Liens
and rights of others (other than the Lessor's
Liens) including, without limitation, rights of
third parties under pooling, interchange,
overhaul, repair and other similar agreements or
arrangements referred to in Section 7.02(a)
hereof;

(viii) each Engine (including any Replacement
Engine) shall be serviceable and shall have been
continuously maintained in accordance with the
Lessee's FAA-approved maintenance program or
the maintenance program of the Lessee approved by
the aeronautical authority of the country of
registry of the Aircraft;

(ix) it shall be in a standard cargo
configuration; and

(x) it shall not be subject to a use
prohibition of the character described in clause
(iv) of the definition of "Event of Loss";
provided, however, that so long as no Event of
Default, Payment Default or Bankruptcy Default
exists if such a use prohibition shall have
occurred and be continuing and shall be curable
by action by the Lessee and the Lessee shall be
undertaking such cure promptly, diligently and
continuously, using its best efforts, then the
Lessee shall have a period of eighteen (18)
months from the date of such prohibition to
effect such cure and the provisions of Section
12.05 hereof shall apply throughout such period.

(b) Remaining Time. On return, (i) the
Airframe shall have been maintained under the Lessee's
continuous maintenance program approved by the FAA.
With respect to maintenance under the Lessee's FAA-
approved maintenance program, or the maintenance program
of the Lessee approved by the aeronautical authority of
the country of registry of the Aircraft, the Lessee shall
have treated the Aircraft in a non-discriminatory
manner with other A310 aircraft in the Lessee's fleet,
and the Aircraft shall be free and clear of all Liens
and rights of others other than the Lessor's Liens and
shall be in compliance in every material respect with
the Lessee's maintenance program as if the Term were
not ending. Any and all defects or discrepancies
revealed by any of the inspection procedures outlined
in Article 14 hereof shall be corrected by Lessee at
Lessee's expense prior to the return of the Aircraft
to Lessor.

Section 12.05. Delayed Return of Aircraft.
(a) If the return of the Aircraft to the Lessor in
compliance with the terms of this Lease shall be
delayed beyond the scheduled end of the Term because
of the occurrence of an event described in clause
(iii)(B) of the definition of Event of Loss or
pursuant to Section 12.04(a)(x), this Lease shall not
terminate but shall continue in full force and effect
until the earlier to occur of the return of the
Aircraft hereunder or the expiration of the six-month
period (or such shorter period referred to in said
clause (iii)(B) or, in the event that Section
12.04(a)(x) shall be applicable, the expiration of the
18-month period referred to therein) after the
scheduled end of the Term, provided that (i)
Stipulated Loss Value during such extension shall be
an amount determined in accordance with Section
4.01(b) hereof, (ii) the Lessee shall pay on demand,
as Basic Rent for each day of such delay and this
Lease shall continue, an amount equal to the average
per diem of the Basic Rent paid during the Basic Term
and the Renewal Rent paid during any Renewal Term or
such higher compensation being paid by the Government
pursuant to the Civil Reserve Airfleet Program and
(iii) neither the Lessee nor any other Person shall
use or operate the Aircraft in any manner, except
pursuant to the activation of such Civil Reserve
Airfleet Program.

(b) If, in the case of a delay in return
pursuant to paragraph (a) above, at the expiration of
the six-month period following the scheduled end of
the Term the Aircraft has not been returned to the
Lessor, an Event of Loss shall be deemed to have
occurred on the date of expiration of such six-month
period (or such shorter period referred to in
paragraph (a) above) or 18-month period if Section
12.04(a)(x) shall be applicable and on such date (or
at such earlier date as an Event of Loss pursuant to
clause (iv) of the definition of Event of Loss shall
have occurred) the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor all
amounts then due hereunder together with the
Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft determined as
of such date; provided, however, that the Lessor shall
have the right to waive payment of such Stipulated
Loss Value and accept the Aircraft on such date, "as
is, where is" (including the Aircraft's being subject
to any use prohibition of the character described in
clause (iv) of the definition of Event of Loss).

(c) In any other situation in which the
Aircraft is not returned to the Lessor upon the
expiration of the Term (other than due to a purchase
of the Aircraft by the Lessee pursuant to this Lease
or by a purchaser under Article 10), the Lessee shall
pay on demand as Rent for each day of such delay and
this Lease shall continue, an amount equal to the
higher of (x) the per diem Fair Market Rental for up
to six (6) months after the end of the Term and (y)
the per diem average of the Basic Rent payable during
the Basic Term, or the Renewal Rent payable during any
Renewal Term; provided, however, that nothing in this
paragraph shall be deemed (i) to relieve the Lessee in
any respect from any Default or Event of Default
arising from the failure to return the Aircraft at the
time or in the condition required by the Operative
Agreements or (ii) to permit the Lessee or any
sublessee to operate or use the Aircraft otherwise
than in connection with effecting such return. For
the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly agreed and
understood that, except with respect to the 18-month
period referred to in Section 12.04(a)(x), no period
of delayed return pursuant to this Article 12 shall
exceed six (6) months.

Section 12.06. Storage. Upon any expiration
or termination of this Lease, at the written request
of the Lessor given at least 15 days prior to such
expiration or termination, the Lessee will arrange, or
will cause to be arranged, at no charge to the Lessor
(subject, however, to the last sentence of this
Section 12.06), storage at a ramp storage facility for
the Aircraft at the Lessee's principal maintenance
facilities in Memphis, Tennessee or one of the
Lessee's other maintenance facilities or at a location
selected by the Lessee used as a location for the
parking or storage of aircraft for a period of up to
30 days. At the end of such 30 day period, if the
Lessor so requests within 10 days before the end of
such period, the Lessee will continue to provide such
ramp storage facility at such facility or location for
an additional 30 days at the Lessor's expense. If the
Lessee is required to move the Aircraft from one
storage facility to another, such move shall be at the
risk and expense of the Lessee during the initial
thirty-day storage period, otherwise the maintenance
and risk of loss of, and responsibility for obtaining
insurance on, the Aircraft shall be the responsibility
of the Lessor during any period of storage; provided,
however, that the Lessee will, upon written request of
the Lessor and at the Lessor's expense, not to exceed
the Lessee's incremental cost of such service, obtain
insurance for the Aircraft (including, if possible,
coverage through its fleet policy). Notwithstanding
other provisions of this Section 12.06, in the event
of an Event of Default all storage, maintenance,
insurance costs and risk of loss for the Aircraft
shall be for the account of the Lessee.

Section 12.07. Special Markings. The Lessee
shall, at the Lessee's cost, completely strip from the
interior and the exterior of the Aircraft all
insignias and other distinctive markings of the Lessee
or any sublessee and repaint the stripped down areas
in a workmanlike manner in matching exterior colors.

Section 12.08. Lessor's Option to Purchase
Parts. At any time after the Lessee has advised the
Lessor that it has determined not to renew this Lease
or purchase the Aircraft, or the Aircraft is otherwise
to be returned to the Lessor, the Lessee shall advise
the Lessor of any Part which the Lessee intends, and
is permitted, to remove as provided in Section 9.02(b)
above, and the Lessor may, at its option, upon 30 days
notice to the Lessee, purchase any or all of such
Parts from the Lessee upon the expiration of the Term
at their then Fair Market Value determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.03 hereof.
Upon any return of the Aircraft pursuant to this
Article 12, if the Lessor does not elect to exercise
its option under this Section 12.08, the Lessee will,
at its own cost and expense, remove such Parts
described in subparagraph (i), (ii), or (iii) to
Section 9.02(b) as the Lessor may request.

ARTICLE 13

risks (including, without limitation, contractual
liability and war risk and allied perils liability),
with such retentions as the Lessee customarily
maintains with respect to similar aircraft and engines
which comprise the fleet of the Lessee (subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 13.06) hereof, and
with such insurers (which shall be insurers of
recognized responsibility), and such insurance against
such other risks as is usually carried by similar
corporations engaged in the same or similar business
and similarly situated as the Lessee and owning or
operating aircraft and engines similar to the
Aircraft and Engines; provided that such insurance
shall not be in amounts less than the amount per
occurrence as shall have been agreed to on the Closing
Date by the Owner Participant, the Lessee and the
Indenture Trustee, unless and only so long as the
Aircraft is not operated and appropriate insurance for
the Aircraft on the ground is maintained;
provided that in no event shall the limits of
liability for all public liability insurance be less
than the amount, per occurrence, as shall have been
agreed to on the Closing Date by the Owner
Participant, the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee,
unless and only so long as the Aircraft is not
operated and appropriate insurance for the Aircraft on
the ground is maintained.

(b) Government Indemnification.
Notwithstanding Section 13.01(a) hereof, in the event
of the requisition for use by the Government of the
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines
then installed on the Airframe, the Lessee shall
maintain throughout the period of such requisition
such insurance as would otherwise be required under
this Section 13.01; provided that the Lessor shall
accept, in lieu of such insurance coverage, written
indemnification or insurance from the Government which
is substantially the same as otherwise required under
this Article 13.

(c) Policy Terms. Any policy of insurance
carried and maintained in accordance with this Section
13.01, and any policy taken out in substitution or
replacement for any such policy subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations thereof, shall:

(i) name or be amended to name the Lessor in
its individual capacity and as owner of the
Aircraft, the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee, in its capacity as such, and each of
their respective Affiliates, successors,
permitted assigns and the respective officers,
directors, employees, servants and agents of the
foregoing in their respective capacities as such
as additional insureds (hereinafter in this
paragraph (c) sometimes referred to as
"Additional Insured");

(ii) provide that, in respect of the
interest of any Additional Insured in such
policies, the insurance shall not be invalidated
by any action or inaction of the Lessee or any
Additional Insured as defined under the policy of
insurance required under this Section 13.01
(other than such Additional Insured) and shall
insure each Additional Insured regardless of any
breach or violation of any warranty, declaration
or condition contained in such policies by the
Lessee or any other Additional Insured as defined
under the policy of insurance required under this
Section 13.01 (other than such Additional
Insured);

(iii) provide that if such insurance is
canceled for any reason, or any substantial
change is made in the policies which adversely
affect the scope of the coverage required herein,
or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for
nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change
or lapse shall not be effective as to any
Additional Insured for thirty (30) days (except
in the case of war risk coverage in which event
the applicable period shall be seven (7) days or
such other period as may be customary) after
receipt by each such Additional Insured of
written notice from such insurers of such
cancellation, change or lapse;

(iv) provide that no Additional Insured
shall have any obligation or liability for
premiums or other payments, if any, in connection
with such insurance;

(v) provide that the insurers shall waive
any rights to be subrogated to the rights of each
Additional Insured, to the extent that the Lessee
has waived its rights under this Lease or the
other Operative Agreements; provided that the
exercise by insurers of rights of subrogation
derived from rights retained by the Lessee shall
not, in any way, delay payment of any claim that
would otherwise be payable by such insurers but
for the existence of rights of subrogation
derived from rights retained by the Lessee;

(vi) provide that such insurer shall waive
the right of such insurer to any set-off or
counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by
attachment or otherwise, in respect of any
liability of any Additional Insured;

(vii) provide that all of the provisions of
such policy shall operate in the same manner as
if there were a separate policy covering each
Additional Insured; provided, that such policies
shall not operate to increase any insurer's limit
of liability; and

(viii) be primary, without right of
contribution from any other insurance which is
carried by any Additional Insured with respect to
its interest in the Aircraft.

Section 13.02. Insurance Against Loss or
Damage to Aircraft and Engines. (a) Hull Insurance.
The Lessee, at its own cost and expense, shall
maintain or cause to be maintained in effect, with
insurers of recognized responsibility, all-risk ground
and flight aircraft hull insurance covering the
Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any
Engines and Parts while temporarily removed from the
Aircraft and not replaced by similar Engines or Parts,
including in each case war-risk and allied perils,
hijacking (air piracy) and governmental confiscation
and expropriation insurance (except, with respect to
governmental confiscation and expropriation, in the
country of registry with such retentions (subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 13.06 hereof) and
in such form and amounts as the Lessee customarily
maintains with respect to the aircraft in the Lessee's
fleet of the same type and model and operated on the
same routes as the Aircraft (except that the Lessee
shall be required to maintain war-risk, hijacking (air
piracy) and governmental confiscation and
expropriation insurance (except, with respect to
governmental confiscation and expropriation, in the
country of registry if the Aircraft is operated on
routes where the custom is for major international Air
Carriers flying comparable routes to carry such
insurance), provided that such insurance shall at all
times while the Aircraft is subject to this Lease and
the Lien of the Indenture be for an amount not less
than an amount equal to the Stipulated Loss Value for
the Aircraft from time to time.

(b) Policy Terms. Any policies carried and
maintained in accordance with this Section 13.02 and
any policies taken out in substitution or replacement
for any such policies subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations thereof shall:

(i) name or be amended to name the Lessor in
its individual capacity and as owner of the
Aircraft, the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee and each of their respective Affiliates,
successors, permitted assigns and the respective
officers, directors, employees, servants and
agents of the foregoing, in their respective
capacities as such, as additional insureds
(hereinafter in this paragraph (b) sometimes
referred to as "Additional Insured"), and the
Lessor (or, so long as the Indenture as it
relates to the Aircraft shall not have been
discharged, the Indenture Trustee) as sole loss
payee (hereinafter in this paragraph (b)
sometimes referred to as "Loss Payee");

(ii) provide with respect to coverage
provided under this Section 13.02, that (i) in
the event of a loss involving proceeds in excess
of $5,000,000 (or in the case of a loss while the
Aircraft is in the possession of a permitted
sublessee or transferee, $2,500,000), the
proceeds in respect of such loss up to an amount
equal to the Stipulated Loss Value for the
Aircraft shall be payable to the Lessor (or, so
long as the Indenture shall not have been
discharged, the Indenture Trustee), it being
understood and agreed that in the case of any
payment to the Lessor (or the Indenture Trustee)
otherwise than in respect of an Event of Loss,
the Lessor (or the Indenture Trustee) shall,
unless a Payment Default or an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, upon
receipt of evidence satisfactory to it that the
damage giving rise to such payment shall have
been repaired or that such payment shall then be
required to pay for repairs then being made, pay
the amount of such payment to the Lessee or its
order, and (ii) the entire amount of any loss
involving proceeds in the aggregate of $5,000,000
(or in the case of a loss while the Aircraft is
in the possession of a permitted sublessee or
transferee, $2,500,000) or less or the amount of
any proceeds of any loss in excess of the
Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft shall be

Default or an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and the insurers have
been notified thereof by the Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee (and if the insurers have
notice of a Payment Default or Event of Default,
such payment shall be made to the Indenture
Trustee);

(iii) provide that if such insurance is
canceled for any reason or any substantial change
is made in the policies which adversely affects
the scope of the coverage required herein, or if
such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment
of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse
shall not be effective as to any Additional
Insured or the Loss Payee for thirty (30) days
(except in the case of war-risk coverage in which
event the applicable period shall be seven (7)
days or such other period as may be customary)
after receipt by each such Additional Insured or
Loss Payee of written notice from such Insurer of
such cancellation, change or lapse;

(iv) provide that, in respect of the
interest of the Lessor (in its individual
capacity and as the Owner Trustee), the Owner
Participant or the Indenture Trustee in their
respective capacities as such in such policies
the insurance shall not be invalidated by any
action or inaction of the Lessee, any Additional
Insured or the Loss Payee (other than any action
or inaction of such Additional Insured or the
Loss Payee) and shall insure the Lessor (in its
individual capacity and as Owner Trustee), the
Owner Participant or the Indenture Trustee,
regardless of any breach or violation of any
warranty, declaration or condition in such
policies by the Lessee or any other Insured as
defined under the policy of insurance required
under this Section 13.02;

(v) provide that the insurers shall waive
any rights of subrogation against the Lessor (in
its individual capacity and as Owner Trustee),
the Owner Participant or the Indenture Trustee,
to the extent that the Lessee has waived its
rights under this Lease; provided that the
exercise by insurers of rights of subrogation
derived from rights retained by the Lessee shall
not, in any way, delay payment of any claim that
would otherwise be payable by such insurers but
for the existence of rights of subrogation
derived from rights retained by the Lessee;

any right of such insurer to any set-off or
counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by
attachment or otherwise, in respect of any
liability of any Additional Insured or Loss
Payee;

contribution from any other insurance which is
carried by any Additional Insured or Loss Payee
with respect to its interest in the Aircraft; and

(viii) provide that no Additional Insured or
Loss Payee shall have any obligation or liability
for premiums or other payments, if any, in
connection with such insurance.

Section 13.03. Application of Insurance
Proceeds. (a) Generally. All insurance proceeds
(other than proceeds from policies carried by the
Lessor, the Owner Participant or the Indenture
Trustee) received under policies described in Section
13.02 hereof as the result of the occurrence of an
Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an
Engine will be applied as follows:

(i) if such proceeds are received with
respect to the Airframe or with respect to the
Airframe and the Engines or engines then
installed on the Airframe, so much of such
proceeds as shall not exceed the amounts required
to be paid by the Lessee pursuant to said Section
11.02 hereof shall be applied in reduction of the
Lessee's obligation to pay such amounts if not
already paid by the Lessee, or if already paid by
the Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse the
Lessee for its payment of such amounts, provided
that no Payment Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, and the balance,
if any, of such proceeds remaining will be paid
to the order of the Lessee; if and so long as the
foregoing proviso is not satisfied, such proceeds
shall be held pursuant to Section 23.01 hereof as
security for the Lessee's obligations hereunder
and under the Participation Agreement; or

(ii) if such proceeds are received with
respect to an Engine not then installed on the
Airframe and not replaced by an Engine or engine
under the circumstances contemplated by Section
11.04 hereof, all such proceeds shall be paid to
the Indenture Trustee (unless the Indenture has
been discharged in which case paid to the Lessor)
for disbursement to the order of the Lessee,
after the Lessee shall have fully performed the
terms of Section 11.04 hereof with respect to the
Event of Loss for which such proceeds are paid,
provided that no Payment Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing; if
and so long as the foregoing proviso is not
satisfied, such proceeds shall be held pursuant
to Section 23.01 hereof as security for the
Lessee's obligations hereunder and under the
Participation Agreement.

(b) Payment if no Event of Loss. The
insurance proceeds of any property damage loss not
constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the
Aircraft, the Airframe or an Engine will be applied in
payment (or to reimburse the Lessee) for repairs or
for replacement property in accordance with Articles 7
and 8 hereof, if not already paid for by the Lessee,
and any balance remaining after compliance with said
Articles 7 and 8 hereof with respect to such loss
shall be paid to the order of the Lessee, provided
that no Payment Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; if and so long as the
foregoing proviso is not satisfied, such proceeds
shall be held pursuant to Section 23.01 hereof as
security for the Lessee's obligations hereunder and
under the Participation Agreement.

(c) Information. If any Additional Insured
becomes subject to any claim covered by any insurance
policy maintained pursuant to this Article 13, the
Lessee shall make available any information required
by such Additional Insured in connection with such
claim.

Section 13.04. Reports. On or before the
Commencement Date and thereafter annually on or before
the scheduled expiration date for such policy during
the Term (the "Expiration Date"), an aviation
insurance broker will furnish to the Lessor and the
Indenture Trustee a signed report, stating the types
of coverage and limits carried and maintained on the
Aircraft and certifying that such insurance complies
with the terms and conditions of this Lease. The
Lessee will cause its aviation insurance broker to
advise the Lessor, the Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee in writing promptly of any default
in the payment of any premium and of any other act or
omission on the part of the Lessee of which it has
knowledge and which might invalidate, cause
cancellation of or render unenforceable all or any
part of any insurance carried by the Lessee with
respect to the Aircraft. The Lessee will cause such
insurance broker to agree to advise the Lessor, the
Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee in writing
if and when it becomes evident to such broker that any
insurance policy carried and maintained on the
Aircraft pursuant to this Article 13 will not be
renewed at the Expiration Date. The Lessee will also
cause such insurance broker to deliver to the Lessor,
the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee on or
prior to the date of expiration of any insurance
policy referenced in a previously delivered
certificate of insurance, a new certificate of
insurance, confirming to such parties that such
insurance as certified on the Commencement Date
continues in full force and effect. If the Lessee
shall fail to maintain insurance as required, the
Lessor may, at its option, provide such insurance, and
in such event, the Lessee shall, upon demand,
reimburse the Lessor, as Supplemental Rent, for the
cost of such insurance; provided, however, that no
exercise of said option shall affect the provisions of
this Lease, including the provisions that failure by
the Lessee to maintain the prescribed insurance shall
constitute an Event of Default or otherwise constitute
a waiver of any other rights the Lessor may have
against the Lessee.

Section 13.05. Lessor's Insurance. The
Lessor may insure the Airframe or any Engine at its
own cost and expense, including insuring the Aircraft
for amounts in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value of
the Aircraft, provided that any insurance so
maintained by the Lessor shall not result in a
reduction of coverage or amounts payable under
insurance required or permitted to be maintained by
the Lessee under this Article 13 or increase the cost
to the Lessee of maintaining such insurance; provided
further, that any insurance policies of the Lessor
insuring the Airframe or any Engine shall provide for
a release to the Lessee of any and all salvage rights
in and to the Airframe or any Engine.

Section 13.06. Self-Insurance. The Lessee
may self-insure the risks required to be insured
against by Sections 13.01 and 13.02 hereof in such
reasonable amounts as are then applicable to other
aircraft or engines of the Lessee of value comparable
to the Aircraft, but in no case shall such
self-insurance with respect to all aircraft in the
Lessee's fleet in aggregate exceed for any 12-month
year an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 50% of the
highest insured value of any single aircraft in the
Lessee's fleet and (ii) 1.5% of the average aggregate
insured value from time to time of the Lessee's entire
aircraft fleet provided that a standard deductible per
occurrence per aircraft not in excess of the amount
customarily allowed as a deductible in the industry
shall be permitted in addition to the above-mentioned
self-insurance. The foregoing shall not permit Lessee
to discriminate as between insurance coverage on the
Aircraft and insurance which Lessee maintains with
respect to similar aircraft owned or operated by the
Lessee operating on similar routes in similar
locations.

ARTICLE 14

INSPECTION

Section 14.01. Right of Inspection. At all
times following the Commencement Date, the Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee (if the Indenture is still in
effect), and the Owner Participant or their respective
authorized representatives, at such party's expense
may at any reasonable times and upon reasonable prior
notice, inspect the Aircraft, the books and records of
the Lessee relating to the maintenance of the
Aircraft, and such other information as they may
reasonably request, and may make copies of those parts
of such books, records and other information as are
not deemed to be confidential by the Lessee. Within
365 days before the end of the Term, the Lessee shall
upon a request from the Lessor (i) advise the Lessor,
the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee (if the
Indenture is still in effect) of any major maintenance
visits scheduled during such 365-day period and shall
permit the Lessor, the Indenture Trustee (if the Indenture
is still in effect) and the Owner Participant or their
respective authorized representatives to observe such
major maintenance visit and (ii) cooperate with the
Lessor generally in making the Aircraft available for
inspection by the Lessor's prospective purchasers or
lessees, in all such cases, so long as such
observation or inspection does not interfere with the
Lessee's operation and maintenance of the Aircraft.

Section 14.02. No Obligation to Inspect.
Neither the Lessor, the Indenture Trustee, nor the
Owner Participant shall have any duty to make any
inspection of the Aircraft and no such party shall

coverage) after receipt by the Lessor of written
notice of such lapse or cancellation or the date that
such lapse or cancellation is effective as to the Lessor
and provided further, that such failure for a period

referred to in the proviso to Section 13.01(b)
hereof is in effect); or

(d) the Lessee shall fail to perform or
observe any other covenant, condition or
agreement to be performed or observed by it under

in the Tax Indemnity Agreement which could give
rise to an obligation on the part of the Lessee
to indemnify thereunder (regardless of Section
26.08 hereof), but subject to Section 16.01(b)
hereof) or any other written agreement of the
Lessee entered into in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Operative
Agreements and such failure shall continue
unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days from
the date on which the Lessee has knowledge of the
failure or the Lessee shall have received written

such 30-day period) the Lessee shall have
promptly undertaken such cure after the earlier

maintain the registration of the Aircraft under
the Act pursuant to the Lessee's covenants and
agreement in Section 6.02(b) of the Participation
Agreement and in Section 7.01(a) of this Lease,

because the Owner Participant or the Lessor has
ceased to be a Citizen of the United States, or
when the lapse of such registration is solely
because the Owner Participant has revoked control
rights pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 7.07
of the Trust Agreement or other similar
arrangements designed to permit such
registration, shall not constitute a Default or
an Event of Default; or

(e) an order for relief shall be entered in
respect of the Lessee by a court having

case under the federal bankruptcy laws as now or
hereafter in effect; or the Lessee shall consent

Lessee shall authorize the Lessee to, or grant
one or more persons authority (at their
discretion) to, seek relief by voluntary

similar law providing for the reorganization or
winding-up of corporations, or providing for an
agreement, composition, extension or adjustment
with its creditors; or

(f) an order, judgment or decree shall be
entered by any court of competent jurisdiction
appointing, without the consent of the Lessee, a

ARTICLE 17

REMEDIES

Section 17.01. Remedies Upon Lessee's
Default. (a) Remedies Generally. Upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default and at any time
after such occurrence so long as the same shall be
continuing, the Lessor may, at its option, declare
this Lease to be in default (except that no such
declaration shall be required in the case of an Event
of Default pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f) or (g) of
Section 16.01 hereof), and at any time thereafter the
Lessor may do, and the Lessee shall comply with, one
or more of the following, as the Lessor in its sole
discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by,
and subject to compliance with, any mandatory
requirements of applicable law then in effect:

(i) Demand in writing that the Lessee shall,
and upon such written demand the Lessee shall, at
the Lessee's own cost and expense, return
promptly to the Lessor the Airframe and Engines
as the Lessor may demand in the manner and
condition required by, and otherwise in
accordance with all of the provisions of, Article
12 (provided that, unless the Lessor shall
require otherwise, the Aircraft shall be returned
within the continental United States), or the
Lessor, at its option, may enter upon the
premises where the Airframe or any Engine is
located or believed to be located and take
immediate possession of and remove the Airframe
or any Engine (together with any engine which is
not an Engine but is installed on the Airframe,
subject to all of the rights of the owner,
lessor, lien holder or secured party of such
engine) without the necessity for first
instituting proceedings, or by summary
proceedings or otherwise, all without liability
of the Lessor to the Lessee for or by reason of
such entry or taking of possession, whether for
the restoration of damage to property caused by
such action or otherwise;

(ii) With or without taking possession
thereof, sell or otherwise dispose of the
Airframe and Engines, at public or private sale
and with or without advertisement or notice to
the Lessee, as the Lessor may determine, and the
Lessor may hold the Lessee liable for any
installment of Basic Rent and Renewal Rent due on
or before the date of such sale of the Aircraft
(and, if such Basic Rent or Renewal Rent is
payable in arrears, the pro rata portion of the
installment of such Basic Rent or Renewal Rent
due on the next succeeding Rent Payment Date in
respect of any period commencing on the
immediately preceding Rent Payment Date to the
date of such sale), or hold, use, operate, lease
to others or keep idle all or any part of the
Airframe or any Engine as the Lessor, in its sole
discretion, may determine, in any such case free
and clear of any rights of the Lessee except as
otherwise set forth in this Article 17, and
without any duty to account to the Lessee with
respect to such action or inaction or for any
proceeds except to the extent required by Section
17.01(a)(iv) hereof; in the event the Lessor
elects to exercise its rights under said Section,
and in connection with any sale of the Aircraft
or any part thereof pursuant to this Article 17,
the Lessor, the Owner Participant or the
Indenture Trustee, may bid for and purchase such
property;

(iii) Whether or not the Lessor shall have
exercised or shall later at any time exercise any
of its rights under Section 17.01(a)(i) or
17.01(a)(ii) hereof, the Lessor, by written
notice to the Lessee specifying a payment date
not earlier than 10 days from the date of such
notice, may demand that the Lessee pay to the
Lessor, and the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on
the payment date specified in such notice, as
liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not
as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent or
Renewal Rent due on Rent Payment Dates occurring
after the payment date specified in such notice),
any installment of Basic Rent or Renewal Rent due
on or before, and any Supplemental Rent due on or
before such payment date, plus an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of the Stipulated Loss Value
for the Aircraft, computed as of the Stipulated
Loss Value Determination Date on or next
preceding the payment date specified in such
notice over the Fair Market Value of the
Aircraft, computed as of the Stipulated Loss
Value Determination Date on or next preceding the
payment date specified in such notice on an "as-
is, where-is" basis and assuming a sale on a
liquidation basis (and calculated assuming that
the Aircraft will be in storage for a period of
twelve months unless the Lessor has arranged for
a sale or a new lease of the Aircraft scheduled
to be completed or to commence within such twelve
month period, in which case such sale or new
lease shall be taken into account in determining
such Fair Market Value) together with interest,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the
Past Due Rate on the amount of such Stipulated
Loss Value, from the applicable Stipulated Loss
Value Determination Date to the date of actual
payment of such amount; provided, however, that
if (and in any event prior to the time for
payment hereunder) the Lessor is unable within a
reasonable period of time to recover possession
of the Aircraft, or any portion thereof, pursuant
to clause (i) above unencumbered by this Lease
and free and clear of all Liens (other than
Lessor's Liens), Fair Market Value of the
Aircraft or such portion shall, at the option of
the Lessor to the extent legally enforceable, be
zero and after payment in full by the Lessee of
the amount specified above and all other amounts
due from the Lessee under this Lease and the
other Operative Agreements, the Lessor shall
promptly transfer (without recourse or warranty
other than as to the absence of the Lessor's
Liens and subject to the disclaimers set forth in
Section 5.01 hereof) all of its right, title and
interest in the Aircraft or such portion, to the
Lessee and the Lessee shall, as promptly as
practicable thereafter sell the Aircraft and
remit to the Lessor the excess, if any, of the
net sales proceeds (after deducting costs of sale
incurred by the Lessee) over such Stipulated Loss
Value;

(iv) In the event the Lessor, pursuant to
Section 17.01(a)(ii) hereof, shall have sold the
Airframe and/or any Engine, the Lessor, in lieu
of exercising its rights under Section
17.01(a)(iii) hereof, may, if it shall so elect,
demand that the Lessee pay the Lessor, and the
Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, on the date of
such sale, as liquidated damages for loss of a
bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu of the
Basic Rent or Renewal Rent due after the date on
which such sale occurs) any unpaid Basic Rent or
Renewal Rent due on or before the date on which
such sale occurs, and any Supplemental Rent due
on or before the date on which such sale occurs,
plus an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(A) the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft,
computed as of the Stipulated Loss Value
Determination Date on or next preceding the sale
date, over (B) the net proceeds of such sale (after
deduction of all of the Lessor's costs and
expenses of such sale, including, without
limitation, sales or transfer taxes, costs of
storage, overhaul, maintenance, preparation and
transportation of the Aircraft and brokers' and
attorneys' fees) together with interest, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, at the Past
Due Rate, on the amount of such excess from the
date of such sale to the date of actual payment
by the Lessee;

(v) Proceed by appropriate court action to
enforce the terms of this Lease or to recover
damages for its breach;

(vi) Terminate or rescind this Lease as to
the Airframe or any or all of the Engines; or

(vii) Exercise any other right or remedy
which may be available to the Lessor under
applicable law.

(b) Cost of Exercise of Remedies. In
addition, the Lessee shall be liable, except as
otherwise provided above, for any and all unpaid Rent
due before, after or during the exercise of any of the
Lessor's remedies, for all amounts payable by the
Lessee under the Participation Agreement before or
after any termination hereof, and for all reasonable
legal fees and other costs and expenses
incurred by the Lessor by reason of the occurrence of
any Event of Default or the exercise of the Lessor's
remedies, including, without limitation, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the return of the
Airframe or any Engine in accordance with the terms of
Article 12 or in placing the Airframe or Engines in
the condition and airworthiness required by such
Article or in connection with any use, operation,
maintenance, storage, or leasing carried out as part
of such exercise.

Section 17.02. Cumulative Remedies. Except
as otherwise provided, no remedy referred to in this
Article 17 is intended to be exclusive, but each shall
be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy
referred to above or otherwise available to the Lessor
at law or in equity; and the exercise or beginning of
exercise by the Lessor of any one or more of such
remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later
exercise by the Lessor of any or all of such other
remedies.

Section 17.03. Waiver. No express or
implied waiver by the Lessor of any Event of Default
shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver
of any future or subsequent Event of Default. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Lessee waives
any rights now or in the future conferred by statute
or otherwise which may require the Lessor to sell,
lease or otherwise use the Airframe or either Engine
in mitigation of the Lessor's damages or which may
otherwise limit or modify any of the Lessor's rights
or remedies under this Article 17. The Lessor's
access to the Aircraft is of the essence and shall not
be impaired.

Section 17.04. Lessor's Right to Perform for
Lessee. If the Lessee fails to make any required
payment of Rent or fails to perform or comply with any
of its agreements contained in this Lease, whether or
not such failure shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder, the Lessor may (but shall not be obligated
to) make such payments or perform or comply with such
agreement, and the amount of such payment and the
amount of the reasonable costs and expenses of the
Lessor incurred in connection with such payment or the
performance of or compliance with such agreement,
together with interest (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) at the Past Due Rate from the date of
the making of such payment or the incurring of such
costs and expenses by the Lessor to the date of
payment of such Rent or other amount by the Lessee,
shall be deemed Supplemental Rent payable by the
Lessee upon demand. No such payment or performance by
the Lessor shall be deemed to waive any Default or
Event of Default or relieve the Lessee of its
obligations hereunder.

ARTICLE 18

COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

Section 18.01. Quiet Enjoyment. So long as
no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each of the parties hereto covenants that
neither it nor any other person lawfully claiming
through it (other than the holder of a Lien which the
Lessee is obligated to discharge pursuant to Article 6
hereof) shall interfere with the Lessee's right to
quietly enjoy the Aircraft without hindrance or
disturbance by it or any such other Person.

ARTICLE 19

Lessee will cause each of this Lease, the Trust
Agreement and the Indenture, and upon the execution

Supplement will cause each of them, to be duly filed
for recordation in accordance with the Act and will
maintain the recordation of the Indenture until the
Lien of the Indenture shall have been discharged

promptly and duly execute and deliver to the Lessor,
the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee such
further documents and assurances to carry out the
intent and purpose of this Lease and the Indenture and

counterparts of this Lease and the Indenture in
accordance with the laws of such jurisdictions as the
Lessor or the Indenture Trustee may from time to time
deem advisable. The foregoing does not impose upon
the Lessor any additional liabilities not otherwise
contemplated by this Lease.

indebtedness evidenced by the Certificates the
Indenture provides, among other things, for the
assignment by the Lessor to the Indenture Trustee of
this Lease and the Lease Supplement and for the

obligation to perform all the terms and provisions to

whatsoever which the Lessor is or may become entitled
to do under this Lease (except as otherwise provided
in the Indenture); all or any of which rights,
obligations, benefits and interests may, pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture, be reassigned or
retransferred by the Indenture Trustee at any time and
from time to time (except as otherwise provided in the
Indenture); provided, however, that the Lessor, except
to the extent, and for such time as, it is unable to
do so by virtue of the Indenture, shall remain liable
for the performance of all the terms, conditions,
covenants and provisions for which it is obligated
under this Lease notwithstanding such assignment. The
Lessee agrees to furnish the Indenture Trustee with
copies of all notices and other communications
required to be made to the Lessor hereunder
contemporaneously with the giving of the same to the
Lessor.

Event of Default, and, at such times as there shall
not be continuing a Default or Event of Default, such

received) realized as the result of any investment
pursuant to Section 23.01(a) hereof (net of any fees,
commissions and other costs and expenses, if any,
incurred by the Lessor in connection with such
investment), unless a Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing in which case
such funds shall be applied in the same manner as the
principal so invested. The Lessee shall be

(C) The Purchase Option Referred to in Section
4.02(a)(C) of the Lease. If any Significant
Expenditure (as defined below) with respect to the
Aircraft is required at any time on or after the
Tax Attribute Period, the Lessee may elect to
terminate the Lease and purchase the Aircraft on
any Rent Payment Date occurring after the Tax
Attribute Period, at the Lessee's option, by either
(1) payment to the Lessor in immediately available
funds of an amount equal to the greater of (x) the
Fair Market Value of the Aircraft or (y) the
Termination Value for the Aircraft, determined in
each case as of such Rent Payment Date or (2) the
assumption by the Lessee pursuant to Section 7.12
of the Participation Agreement of all of the
obligations of the Lessor under the Indenture, the
Certificates and Section 7.04 of the Participation
Agreement and the payment to the Lessor in
immediately available funds of an amount equal to
the excess of (A) the greater of (I) the
Termination Value for the Aircraft, or (II) the
Fair Market Value of the Aircraft, both computed as
of such Rent Payment Date, over (B) the unpaid
principal amount of the Certificates outstanding as
of such Rent Payment Date; it being understood that
Fair Market Value for this purpose shall be
determined without regard to any Significant
Expenditure. For purposes of this paragraph (C)
the term "Significant Expenditure" means
expenditures in respect of non-severable
improvements (i.e. improvements which cannot by the
terms of Section 9.02(b) of the Lease be removed
from the Aircraft) which in the Lessee's reasonable
judgment would exceed $10,000,000 and which the
Owner Participant will not permit to be financed on
similar terms and conditions then available for
similar transactions or through additional equity
investments of the Owner Participant or both (it
being understood that Section 4.02(a)(C) shall not
impose any obligation on the Owner Participant to
provide or permit such financing); or

(D) The Purchase Option Referred to in Section
4.02 (a)(D) of the Lease. In the event that a
Burdensome Indemnity Payment shall occur that is
not deliberately caused by Lessee at any time on or
after the Tax Attribute Period, the Lessee may,
elect to terminate the Lease and purchase the
Aircraft on the first Rent Payment Date (the
"Burdensome Indemnity Payment Date") following the
date that the Owner Participant provides the Lessee
with a written notice of any Loss (as defined in
Section 5 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement) that is a
Burdensome Indemnity Payment, at the Lessee's
option, by either (1) payment to the Lessor in
immediately available funds of an amount equal to
the greater of (x) the Fair Market Value of the
Aircraft or (y) the Termination Value for the
Aircraft, determined in each case as of such
Burdensome Indemnity Payment Date, or (2) the
assumption by the Lessee, pursuant to Section 7.12
of the Participation Agreement, of all of the
obligations of the Lessor under the Indenture, the
Certificates and Section 7.04 of the Participation
Agreement and the payment to the Lessor in
immediately available funds of an amount equal to
the excess of (A) the greater of (I) the
Termination Value for the Aircraft, or (II) the
Fair Market Value of the Aircraft, both computed as
of the Burdensome Indemnity Payment Date, over (B)
the unpaid principal amount of the Certificates
outstanding as of such Date. For purposes of this
paragraph (D), the term "Burdensome Indemnity
Payment" means a Loss, as defined in the Tax
Indemnity Agreement, which causes the aggregate net
present value as of the determination date
discounted at the Debt Rate, of all Losses which
can be avoided through a purchase by the Lessee of
the Aircraft, to exceed 2.5% of the Aircraft Cost.

determine the lower of (x) the amount of cash expected
to be in the Collateral Account on such Payment Date
(giving effect to any income from or proceeds of any
then-existing Specified Investments scheduled to

of the amount of cash expected to be in the Collateral
Account on such Payment Date (giving effect to (1) any
income from or proceeds of any then-existing Specified
Investments scheduled to mature on or prior to the
Scheduled Commencement Date and (2) any payment to be
made on any other Payment Date prior to the Scheduled
Commencement Date) over the Debt Portion. The
Indenture Trustee shall, at or prior to such time of
determination, notify the Owner Trustee of (i) such
lower amount of (x) and (y) above and (ii) the
aggregate amount of interest due with respect to the
Certificates as of such Payment Date. If the amount

Indenture Trustee shall determine the excess of the
amount of cash expected to be in the Collateral
Account on such Payment Date (giving effect to any

Investments scheduled to mature on or prior to such
Payment Date) over the Debt Portion. The Indenture
Trustee shall, at such time of determination, notify

Trustee shall draw the amount of the Debt Service
Shortfall pursuant to the Letter of Credit. If the
Debt Service Shortfall exceeds the amount then

Trustee shall demand, pursuant to the Demand Notes,

to the date that the determination referred to in such
sentence would otherwise be required.

determine the amount of cash expected to be in the

Date). The Indenture Trustee shall, at or prior to
such time of determination, notify the Owner Trustee
of (i) such expected amount and (ii) the aggregate
Prepayment Price due with respect to the Certificates
as of such Pre-Funding Prepayment Date. If the amount
of clause (ii) above exceeds the amount of clause (i)
above (any such excess, the "Prepayment Shortfall"),
the Indenture Trustee shall draw the amount of the
Prepayment Shortfall pursuant to the Letter of Credit.
If the Prepayment Shortfall exceeds the amount then
available under the Letter of Credit, the Indenture
Trustee shall demand, pursuant to the Demand Notes,
the amount of such excess.

(d) Debt Service on the First Payment Date
after the Exchange Date. No later than 9:00 A.M., New
York time, four Frankfurt Business Days prior to the
first Payment Date occurring after the Exchange Date
(unless Section 6(b) hereof shall be applicable to
such Payment Date), the Indenture Trustee shall
determine the amount of cash expected to be in the
Collateral Account on such Payment Date (giving effect
to any income from or proceeds of any then-existing
Specified Investments scheduled to mature on or prior
to such Payment Date). The Indenture Trustee shall,
at or prior to such time of determination, notify the
Owner Trustee of (i) such expected amount of cash and

SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and
Agreements of the Owner Trustee. (a) Representations
and Warranties. The Owner Trustee represents and
warrants that:

(i) except for the interests granted
hereby, the Owner Trustee is the owner and
holder of the Collateral free from any claim,
security interest, encumbrance, lien, charge,
or other right, title or interest of any
person; the Owner Trustee has full power and
lawful authority to enter into this Agreement
and to grant, transfer, pledge and assign the
Collateral to the Indenture Trustee and to
grant to the Indenture Trustee a first and
prior security interest therein as herein
provided, all of which have been duly
authorized by all necessary action; and

(ii) the Owner Trustee has not
heretofore pledged or signed any financing
statement or security agreement (other than

(b) Further Assurances. The Owner Trustee
shall, at its own expense, take such actions and
execute such other writings as may be necessary or as
reasonably requested by the Indenture Trustee to
establish or perfect the security interest created or
purported to be created by the Indenture in the
Collateral and to assist the Indenture Trustee's
realization thereon. In the event of any default in
any execution by the Owner Trustee pursuant hereto,
the Indenture Trustee is authorized to execute any
writings as the Owner Trustee's agent and attorney-in-
fact. The Owner Trustee will not enter into or
execute any security agreement or any financing
statement covering the Collateral, other than those in
favor of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture.

(c) Expenses. In the event the Indenture
Trustee shall incur or pay any taxes, assessments,
interests, costs, penalties or expenses incident to or
in connection with the holding, collection or
protection of the Collateral, or with the enforcement
of any obligation of the Owner Trustee hereunder, the
Owner Trustee shall pay to the Indenture Trustee the
full amount thereof upon demand, and so long as the

payment, this Agreement shall operate as security
therefor.

of Default shall have occurred and shall be

defaulted in its obligation to pay any outstanding
Secured Obligation, the Indenture Trustee may exercise
any of the rights or remedies with respect to the
Collateral set forth in the Indenture.

SECTION 10. Standard of Care. The Indenture
Trustee may execute any of its duties hereunder by or
through agents or employees and shall be entitled to
retain or rely upon experts and to act in reliance
upon the advice of such experts concerning all matters
pertaining to the agencies hereby created and its
duties hereunder, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good
faith in accordance with the advice of such experts.
The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable to the Owner
Trustee for any error of judgment or for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder, or in
connection herewith, except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct; nor shall the
Indenture Trustee be responsible for the Specified
Investments (or any part thereof) or the performance
thereof, except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to rely on any communication, instrument,
paper or other document believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper person or persons. The Indenture Trustee shall
be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody and preservation of the Collateral if the
Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal
to that which the Indenture Trustee accords its own
property.

the security interests created with respect to the
Collateral under the Indenture shall terminate upon
