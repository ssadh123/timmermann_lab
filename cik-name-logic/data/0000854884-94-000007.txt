CHICAGO AND NORTH WESTERN HOLDINGS CORP.
ANNOUNCES ESTIMATE FOR FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
AND RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

Chicago, Illinois, April 22, 1994 -- Chicago and North Western

Holdings Corp. (NYSE: CNW) today announced that next week it

expects to report first quarter 1994 net income of approximately

$16.5 million, or 35 to 37 cents per share, compared with net

income of $14.6 million, or 33 cents per share, in the first

quarter of last year. This year's results were achieved despite

the effects of severe winter weather and reflect a net accounting

adjustment resulting from errors and irregularities that reduced

net income by $800,000, or 2 cents per share (a reduction of $1.3

million in pre-tax income).

The net adjustment reflects the conclusions of an

investigation, conducted for the audit committee of the company's

board of directors, by the company's outside counsel and Arthur

Andersen & Co., the company's independent public accountants, as

well as a review, conducted by special counsel to the audit<PAGE>

committee, of a part of the investigation. The company noted

that the net adjustment is not material to the company's

financial position or results of operations of past periods, and

because the net adjustment is not material to the first quarter

of 1994, the company will not restate its past annual and

quarterly financial statements. The investigation also concluded

that there was no evidence that any funds or other assets were

improperly diverted from the company.

The net adjustment results from errors and irregularities

that increased net income in past periods by approximately $3.2

million, offset by those that decreased net income in past

periods by approximately $2.4 million. The problems were the

result of inappropriate recording of certain operating expenses,

and relate primarily to the fourth quarter of 1993, resulting in

a net overstatement of $1.0 million ($.02 per share) in 1993

fourth quarter reported net income of $24.5 million, or $.54 per

share (an overstatement of $1.6 million in pre-tax income), and a

net overstatement of approximately $500,000 ($.01 per share) in

1993 reported net income of $53.2 million, or $1.20 per share (an

overstatement of $800,000 in pre-tax income). The investigation

also identified errors and irregularities in the earlier quarters

in 1993 and in fiscal 1992 and 1991, that resulted in a net

understatement of $.02 per share in reported loss in 1991 (in

which there was a reported net loss of $4.72 per share); no net

effect on reported net loss per share for 1992; a net

understatement of $.01 per share in reported earnings in each of<PAGE>

3

the first two quarters of 1993 (in which there were reported net

earnings per share of $.33 and $.43, respectively); and no effect

on reported loss per share for the third quarter of 1993.

The company is taking immediate action to review and tighten

its financial controls and to review and strengthen its program

for assuring observance of the highest legal and ethical

standards by company personnel.

In addition, although they were not involved in any way in

the underlying errors and irregularities, Mr. Thomas A. Tingleff,

senior vice president--Finance and Accounting, and Mr. R. Scott

Morgan, vice president and controller, have been dismissed

because of the manner in which they handled the matter after they

discovered it. Two other company employees were also dismissed. 

The Operating department is being restructured and Mr. Robert A.

Jahnke, senior vice president--Operations, although not involved

in the errors and irregularities, is being reassigned to the

position of senior vice president--Planning.

The company also announced that Mr. John M. Butler, retired

senior vice president--Finance and chief financial officer of the

company, will return to that position on an interim basis.

"Although the amounts involved are small and not material to

the company's financial results for the periods affected, we take

this matter very seriously," Robert Schmiege, the company's

chairman, president and chief executive officer, said. "We have

taken decisive steps to prevent any recurrence. The two cent per

share adjustment should not obscure the company's performance<PAGE>

4

during the first quarter, which was strong in spite of severe

weather conditions," Schmiege added.

Chicago and North Western Holdings Corp. is the holding

company for the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company,

a leading railroad freight hauler in the central transcontinental

corridor and major transporter of coal, grain and double-stack

containers.
