FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION TO ACQUIRE
THE CONTINENTAL CORPORATION FOR $1.1 BILLION

CHICAGO, December 6, 1994 - CNA Financial Corporation (CNA) and The
Continental Corporation (Continental) today have signed an agreement
under which CNA will acquire Continental through a cash merger for $1.1
billion, or $20 a share. The acquisition will create the seventh largest
U.S. insurance group.

Dennis H. Chookaszian, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the CNA
Insurance Companies, said that the acquisition presents a unique
opportunity to build a world-class insurance organization.

Continental's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John P. Mascotte
said that the merger will achieve an impressive collaboration of the
talents, strengths and resources of both companies. 

Both boards have approved the transaction. The acquisition may be
funded with long-term debt or may include a combination of long-term debt
and equity.

In conjunction with CNA's acquisition of Continental, CNA will invest
an additional $275 million which takes the place of the funds that
Insurance Partners, L.P., had committed under a previous agreement with
Continental.

Chookaszian said that the acquisition of Continental will expand CNA's
product portfolio for customers and agents. "The opportunity to acquire
high-quality assets and gain additional market presence, while building
on our solid financial strength is very exciting," he said.

"Numerous economics of scale and market efficiencies make the agreement
an excellent business decision," said Chookaszian. "We see opportunities
to apply both companies' experience in improving efficiencies, and this
should reduce costs. In addition, the insurance expertise of CNA and
Continental can be further leveraged through the agents and brokers of
both organizations."

CNA's solid capital position, high-quality, conservative investment
portfolio and positive operating trends all contribute to CNA's ability
to make a success of the acquisition. CNA's strong debt-to-capital ratio
of 17 percent, plus the economic benefits of the acquisition, will more
than support the financing.

CNA and Continental will jointly seek regulatory approvals as quickly
as possible. Until the acquisition is completed, Continental will
continue to operate independently. Mascotte will continue as chairman and
chief executive officer for the interim period. In addition, a transition
team composed of key people from both organizations will be formed to
ensure that CNA and Continental are smoothly combined.

CNA Financial Corporation is the parent company of the CNA Insurance
Companies, the 12th largest U.S. insurance organization and the sixth
largest U.S. property-casualty insurance group as measured by 1993
premium volume. Loews Corporation owns 84 percent of the common stock of
CNA Financial Corporation. CNA had 1993 revenues of $11 billion and
assets of $41.9 billion as of December 31, 1993. The principle CNA
Insurance Companies are Continental Casualty Company and Continental
Assurance Company.

The Continental Corporation, headquartered in New York, is the 11th
largest U.S. property-casualty insurance company based on 1993 premium
volume. Continental had 1993 revenues of $5 billion and assets of $16
billion as of December 31, 1993.
