Item 5. Other Events

On September 6, 1994, the Registrant announced plans to
purchase from General Reinsurance Corporation its 50 percent
interest in Engineering Insurance Group (EIG), a joint
partnership of the Registrant and General Reinsurance
Corporation formed in 1988. The Registrant will issue
convertible preferred stock to General Reinsurance with a
value of $20 million and expects to sign the purchase
agreement in late September. After the purchase,
Engineering Insurance Company Limited (EICL), the operating
company of EIG licensed in the United Kingdom in 1990, will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. EICL
will remain a United Kingdom insurance company with its own
capitalization and reinsurance capacity. EICL's current
annual gross written premiums are approximately $45 million.
