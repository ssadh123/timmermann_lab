FOR RELEASE JUNE 6, 1994

SPRINT AND EDS NO LONGER DISCUSSING MERGER OF EQUALS
Companies To Continue Discussions Concerning 
Possible Strategic Relationship

NEW YORK, June 6, 1994 -- Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and Sprint 
Corporation announced today that, in their ongoing discussions, the 
companies are no longer considering a merger of equals but are 
continuing to explore other forms of a strategic relationship. The 
companies said they have been unable to reach agreement with respect to 
the financial terms of a merger transaction.

This announcement follows a May 16 disclosure that the two companies 
had been engaged in broad discussions, which included a possible merger 
of equals, but that "significant issues, including relative values" 
remained to be resolved.

EDS chairman and chief executive officer Les Alberthal and Sprint 
chairman and chief executive officer William T. Esrey said the two 
companies continue to believe that convergence of their industries will 
create tremendous opportunities.

"We have been in discussions concerning how to best integrate these 
converging functions for the benefit of our customers," said Messrs. 
Esrey and Alberthal. "Part of those discussions involved exploring a 
merger of equals. That option is no longer being discussed, but there 
may be other ways we can work together to achieve strategic 
objectives."

General Motors stated today that it would continue to consider a 
spin-off of EDS to Class E shareholders to facilitate EDS' ability to 
attain its strategic objectives. Such a spin-off could occur through 
an exchange of EDS common stock for Class E stock and would be proposed 
only in a transaction that is tax-free.

EDS has operations in more than 30 countries, employs approximately 
70,000 and is the leader in applying information technology to meet the 
needs of businesses and governments around the world. Class E stock is 
a common stock of General Motors, traded under the symbol GME. EDS 
reported revenues of $8.6 billion in 1993.
