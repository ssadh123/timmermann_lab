TAMBRANDS REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS

White Plains, New York--April 26, 1994--Tambrands Inc. (NYSE:TMB) today
reported sales and earnings for the first quarter of 1994.

Howard B. Wentz, Jr., Chairman of the Board, announced that net sales for
the quarter were $139,173,000, compared to $154,348,000 in the first
quarter of 1993. Sales were down principally because of lower U.S.
volumes, which resulted primarily from a continuing reduction in trade
customer inventory. Also, last year's first quarter included introductory
shipments of a new 20-count package size.

Net earnings were $22,044,000, or $.58 per share, compared to $21,939,000,
or $.56 per share, in the first quarter of 1993. First-quarter 1993 has
been restated to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in the method of
accounting for postemployment benefits, as previously announced. Without
the restatement, earnings for last year's first quarter were $.82 per
share.

Wentz said, "In the first quarter, we continued to see strong growth of the
tampon category in the United States, supported by our successful
advertising campaign. However, the Tampax market share was adversely
affected by the heavy promotional activity of our competitors." Marketing,
selling and distribution expenses in the quarter were above last year's
levels, as the Company continued its increased marketing spending.

The Company also announced that the Board of Directors today declared a
regular quarterly dividend of $.42 per share, payable on June 15, 1994 to
shareholders of record on June 3, 1994.

Tambrands manufactures Tampax(R) tampons and markets them around the world.
