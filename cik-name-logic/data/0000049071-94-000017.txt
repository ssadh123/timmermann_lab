Item 5. Other Events

After the close of business on June 14, 1994, Humana Inc.
announced that it received $71 million in tax refunds for
settlement of certain income tax disputes with the Internal
Revenue Service related to the timing of medical claims
deductions and the deductibility of intangible amortization
for the tax years 1988 through 1991. The company previously
made a tax and interest prepayment during 1992 for the 1988
and 1989 tax years.

As a result of the settlement, the company will recognize a
$29 million reduction of interest expense and a $10 million
reduction of tax expense which represents the cumulative
effect from 1988 to present of amounts provided for such
items. The remainder of the refund will reduce the deferred
tax asset currently being carried on the company's balance
sheet.

Concurrently, the company provided $18 million for the
writedown of a non-operational asset. Combining the effect of
the tax refund and the write-down of the non-operational
asset, Humana's results of operations for the second quarter
ending June 30, 1994, will be increased by $17 million or $.10
per share. For the remainder of 1994, the benefit of the tax
settlement and non-operational adjustment in the company's
results of operations will approximate $.04 per share.
