INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors
FGC Holding Company
Martin, Kentucky

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
FGC Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Guaranty National
Bank, Martin, Kentucky as of December 31, 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable, but not absolute, assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FGC
Holding Company and Subsidiary at December 31, 1992 and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

FGC HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Basis of Presentation - These financial statements include
the accounts of FGC Holding Company (the Company) and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, First Guaranty National Bank (the Bank). All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

B. Investment Securities - Investment securities are carried at
cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on a
constant yield basis. Gains or losses on dispositions are computed using the
specific identification method.

C. Loans - Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal,
reduced by unearned interest and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income
from certain installment loans is recognized on the sum-of-the-months-digits
method (Rule of 78's), which approximates income earned on the accrual basis.
Income from all other loans is recorded on the accrual basis, except for those
loans on a nonaccruing income status. Accrual of interest is discontinued on a
loan when management believes, after considering economic and business
conditions and collection efforts, that the borrowers' financial condition is
such that collection of interest is doubtful.

The provision for loan losses is an amount that is sufficient to
maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level to absorb future
loan losses based on management's best estimate of possible loan losses,
predicated upon such considerations as the current condition and volume of the
Bank's loan portfolio, economic conditions within the Bank's service area and
any other factors influencing the collectibility of the loan portfolio.

D. Bank Premises and Equipment - Bank premises and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using straight-line methods
for buildings and both straight-line and accelerated methods for furniture and
equipment.

E. Other Real Estate Owned - Real estate acquired through
foreclosure is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the property
or its fair value. The value of the underlying loan is written down to the
fair value of the real estate to be acquired by a charge to the allowance for
loan losses. Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, and
gains and losses on their disposition, are included in other expenses.

F. Income Taxes - The Company and the Bank file a consolidated
federal income tax return. Income taxes are allocated on a separate return
basis.

Deferred federal income taxes are provided on certain
transactions which are reported for financial statement purposes in different
years than for income tax purposes. The principal differences are in
provisions for loan losses, depreciation on premises and equipment, accretion
of discounts on securities, income from leveraged lease financing and changes
in accounting methods being amortized over periods of four to ten years for
income tax purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992
(CONTINUED)

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes". The Statement requires the use of the liability method for computing
deferred income taxes no later than 1993, with earlier adoption encouraged.
Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are based on the change from
the beginning of the year in the deferred tax liability or asset established
for the expected future tax consequences of differences in the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

The Company has postponed adoption of the Statement until 1993.
Adoption of the Statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the
Company's financial position.

G. Leveraged Leases - The Bank has entered into leveraged leases
which are financing arrangements whereby the major portion of the cost of the
equipment leased is financed with nonrecourse debt from another investor. The
financial statements reflect the Bank's investment, net of unearned income and
nonrecourse debt. The investment is reduced by cash flows arising from the
transaction, after providing necessary amounts for deferred income taxes in the
period in which the benefits arise. Income is recorded under a method which
relates return to investment.

H. Purchase Method of Accounting - The net assets of First
Guaranty National Bank acquired in a purchase transaction are recorded at the
fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess cost over net assets
acquired (goodwill) is being amortized by the straight-line method over 25
years.

Treasury Tax and Loan account and other purposes as required or permitted by
law.

Proceeds from sales and calls of investment securities during
1992 were approximately $2,472,000, resulting in gross gains of $48,040 and
gross losses of $0.

NOTE 3 - LOANS

Major classifications of loans at December 31, 1992 are
summarized as follows:

<TABLE>

------------ 
$ 65,240,407

</TABLE>
The amount of loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 1992 was
approximately $292,000. Interest income on these loans that would have been
earned had they not been placed on nonaccrual status approximated $25,000 for
1992.

Certain directors and executive officers of the Bank, including
their immediate families and companies in which they are principal owners, are
loan customers of the Bank. Total loans to these persons at December 31, 1992
approximated $378,000. Such loans were made in the ordinary course of business
at the Bank's normal credit terms and interest rates.

The Bank's investment in leveraged leases amounted to $114,321 at
December 31, 1992. Deferred income tax credits applicable to such leases,
amounting to $38,869 at December 31, 1992 are included in deferred income taxes
on the accompanying balance sheet. Outstanding nonrecourse debt on these
leases amounted to $0 at December 31, 1992.

NOTE 5 - BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Bank premises and equipment at December 31, 1992 are summarized
as follows:

$ 2,021,711

Depreciation expense was $187,513 for 1992.

</TABLE>
NOTE 6 - DEBENTURES PAYABLE

Debentures payable at December 31, 1992 consists of four
identical debentures dated January 20, 1988 payable to the four individuals who
previously owned the Bank. Principal payments commenced on January 1, 1989 and
are due annually on January 1 of each year through 2000. The debentures bear
interest for the first five years at a rate of 9%, payable quarterly. After
the first five years, the interest rate is equal to the prime rate as quoted in
the Wall Street Journal. The debentures are collateralized by 100% of the
issued and outstanding common stock of First Guaranty National Bank.

The debentures require the maintenance of certain capital and
operational ratios for the Bank, all of which have been complied with at
December 31, 1992, however, the Company has failed to fully comply with certain
affirmative and negative covenants contained in the debentures. Management
believes that any adverse impact resulting from these failures will not have a
material effect on the Company's financial condition.

NOTE 6 - DEBENTURES PAYABLE (CONTINUED)

The Company may, at its option, repay the debentures, with
certain restrictions, in whole or in part at any time. Principal payments due
on the debentures during the five years subsequent to December 31, 1992 are as
follows: 1993 - $0; 1994 - $0; 1995 - $500,000; 1996 - $700,000; 1997 -
$750,000.

NOTE 7 - NOTES PAYABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS

Notes payable at December 31, 1992 consists of two identical
unsecured notes dated January 20, 1988, payable to two of the stockholders of
the Company. Principal is due on demand. The notes bear interest for the
first five years at a rate of 9%, payable quarterly. After the first five
years, the interest rate is equal to the prime rate as quoted in the Wall
Street Journal.

NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31,
1992 is summarized as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Currently payable $ 740,482
Deferred (190,655)
------------ 
$ 549,827

</TABLE>
Deferred income taxes according to timing differences which
caused them for the year ended December 31, 1992 were as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Lease financing income $ 46,223
Provision for loan losses 93,759
Amortization of changes in tax
accounting methods 28,446
Depreciation (25,600)
Accretion of discounts on securities 40,951
Other 6,876
------------
$ 190,655
</TABLE>

The income tax provision is less than that obtained by using the
statutory Federal corporate income tax rate, principally due to interest income
of approximately $926,000 being exempt from Federal income taxes.

NOTE 9 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its
customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in
the form of unused lines of credit. The Bank uses the same credit policies in
making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet
instruments.

Page 10
<PAGE> 16
FGC HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992
(CONTINUED)

NOTE 9 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK (CONTINUED)

At December 31, 1992, the Bank had commitments to extend credit
of approximately $657,000 whose contract amounts represent credit risk.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer
as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. The Bank evaluates each customer's
credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. Since many of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Collateral held varies,
but primarily includes real estate.

NOTE 10 - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Bank grants residential, commercial and consumer loans to
customers primarily located in Floyd and Knott Counties in Kentucky. Although
the Bank has a diverse loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its debtors'
ability to perform on their contracts is influenced by the coal industry which
has a significant impact on the local economy.

NOTE 11 - DIVIDEND LIMITATION

The Company's principal source of funds is dividends received
from the bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be
paid without prior approval of the Bank's regulatory agency. Under these
regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is
limited to the current year's net profits, as defined, combined with the
retained net profits of the preceding two years. During 1993, the Bank could,
without prior approval, declare dividends of approximately $3,234,000 plus any
1993 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.

NOTE 12 - PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has authorized, issued and outstanding two classes of
preferred stock, Class A and Class B. Both classes of preferred stock and all
dividends to which it is entitled shall have a preference as to all other
shareholders on all of the assets of the corporation. Each share of preferred
stock is subject to redemption and may, at the option of the Company, on any
dividend payment date, at any time after January 20, 1993, be called and
retired at the cash price per share equal to its par value.

At December 31, 1992, there were no dividends on the preferred
stock in arrears.

NOTE 13 - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Bank and certain officers and directors are named defendants
in legal actions arising from the purchase of the Bank by the Company. This
litigation has been settled by the parties agreeing to a dismissal of all
claims, subject to court approval, therefore, the ultimate liability, if any,
resulting from these actions is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On January 28, 1994, the Company entered into a merger agreement
with Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. of Bowling Green, Kentucky, whereby Trans
Financial will exchange 1,050,000 shares of its common stock for 100% of the
common stock of FGC Holding Company. The merger is contingent upon regulatory
approval.

cause to be taken any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, that

the

acknowledges and agrees that the certificates representing shares of
Corporation Common Stock to be received by such Shareholder in the Merger will

proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its
shareholders) with respect to a merger, acquisition, consolidation or similar
transaction involving, or any purchase of all or any significant portion of the
assets or any equity securities of, FGC or any FGC Subsidiary (any such
proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal")
or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or

3.12 Indemnification.

A. From and after the Effective Time, the Corporation
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an executive officer or director of FGC or
any FGC Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against (i) all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement with the approval of the Corporation (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or
in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of FGC
or any FGC Subsidiary, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or
at or after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"), and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case to the full extent FGC would have been permitted under law
and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws to indemnify such person (and the
Corporation shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such
action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking required by law). Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), (i) any counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties for any period after the Effective Time shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Corporation; (ii) after the Effective Time, the Corporation
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received to the extent permitted by
law and upon receipt of any undertaking required by law; and (iii) after the
Effective Time, the Corporation will use all reasonable efforts to assist in
the vigorous defense of any such matter, provided that the Corporation shall
not be liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its written
consent, which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 3.12,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall notify the Corporation in writing (but the failure so to notify the
Corporation shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this
Section 3.12 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
Corporation), and shall deliver to the Corporation the undertaking, if any,
required by law. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law
firm to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

9

<PAGE> 10

B. The provisions of this Section 3.12 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his
heirs and his representatives.

3.13 Employee Benefits. At, or as soon as administratively
feasible after, the Effective Time, employees and officers of FGC and each FGC
Subsidiary shall be provided with such employee benefits as Corporation from
time to time generally provides to employees and officers of a Corporation
Subsidiary, including, but not limited to, participation in Corporation's
Employee Stock Ownership Plan, Savings Investment Plan, life, medical and
hospitalization and disability insurance, and sick pay, vacation, personal
leave and severance benefits, on a non-discriminatory and substantially similar
basis. For purposes of providing such benefits to employees and officers of
FGC or any FGC Subsidiary after the Effective Time, the Corporation shall
credit such employees and officers for years of service at FGC or any FGC
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting.

3.14 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, each party to this Agreement shall take
all such necessary action.

3.16 Certain Covenants of Corporation. Within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the Effective Time, Corporation, at its expense, shall file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act a
registration statement pursuant to which the Shareholders may publicly offer
and sell the shares of Corporation Common Stock they receive in the Merger and
shall take all actions necessary to register or qualify such shares pursuant to
all applicable state "blue sky" or securities laws. Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain such registration statement (and such
registrations and qualifications) in effect for three years after the Effective
Time. FGC and the Shareholders shall cooperate fully with, and provide full,
complete and accurate information to, Corporation in connection with such
registration statement and any filings related thereto. In no event, however,
shall any party hereto be liable for, and each party shall indemnify and hold
the other harmless from, any untrue statement of a material fact or omission to
state a material fact in any registration statement filed pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 3.16 made in reliance upon, and in conformity with,
written information concerning the other party furnished by such other party
specifically for use in such registration statement.

ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

4.1 Representation and Warranties of Shareholders as to title and
Authority. Each Shareholder, severally and not jointly, represents and
warrants to Corporation, only on such Shareholder's behalf and only with
respect to the shares of FGC Common Stock owned by such Shareholder, as
follows:

A. Power and Authority of Shareholders. Shareholder has
the right, power and capacity to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by such Shareholder and
constitutes Shareholder's legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against Shareholder in accordance with its terms. The execution, delivery and
performance by such Shareholder of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, with or without the giving of notice
or the lapse of time, or both, (i) violate any provision of law, statute, rule
or regulation to which such Shareholder is subject, (ii) violate any order,
judgment or decree applicable to such Shareholder, or (iii) violate, conflict
with, or result in a breach or default under, or cause the termination of, any
term or condition of any agreement, document or other instrument to which such
Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder or such Shareholder's
properties may be bound.

B. Ownership of Shares. Shareholder owns good record and
beneficial title to the number of shares of FGC Common Stock and FGC Preferred
Stock set forth beside Shareholder's name on Exhibit 4.1 to this Agreement,
free and clear of any liens, restrictions, claims, equities, charges, options,
rights of first refusal, or encumbrances, with no defects of title whatsoever.
Shareholder owns, of record or beneficially, no other shares of capital stock 
of FGC or any other equity security of FGC or right or option of any kind to 
have any such equity security issued. Upon consummation of the Merger, 
Corporation shall have obtained good title to all shares of FGC Common Stock 
owned by Shareholder, free and clear of any liens, restrictions, claims,
equities, options, charges, rights of first refusal, or encumbrances or other 
restrictions, and with no defects of title whatsoever. Shareholder has the 
exclusive right, power and authority to vote the shares of FGC Common Stock 
owned by Shareholder. Shareholder covenants that it is not a party to or 
bound by any agreement affecting or relating to Shareholder's right to 
transfer or vote the shares of FGC Common Stock owned by Shareholder.

C. Investment and Other Representations. Shareholder is
acquiring the shares of Corporation Common Stock in the Merger for his or its
own account for investment and not with a view to or for sale, distribution or
other disposition, unless such shares are

11

<PAGE> 12

registered under the Securities Act, or, in the opinion of knowledgeable
counsel, transferred under an applicable exemption from registration.
Shareholder has had an adequate opportunity to ask questions of and receive
answers from the officers and other employees of Corporation and has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he or it is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in Corporation
Common Stock. Shareholder is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined
in Rule 501 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act.

4.2 FGC's Representations and Warranties. Except as Previously
Disclosed, FGC hereby represents and warrants to Corporation as follows:

A. Corporate Standing; Authorization.

(i) FGC is a bank holding company registered
under the BHCA. FGC and each FGC Subsidiary is a Kentucky corporation
or banking corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. FGC and each
FGC Subsidiary has paid all fees due and owing to the Office of the
Kentucky Secretary of State, has delivered to that office its most
recent annual report as required by the Act, and has never filed
articles of dissolution with the Kentucky Secretary of State or the
KDFI. FGC has delivered to Corporation true and correct copies of the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of FGC and all amendments thereto

requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties

material benefit under, or the creation of a lien, pledge, security
interest, charge or other encumbrance on assets (any such conflict,

has any obligations or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) that might
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the business, assets, results of operations or financial
condition of FGC and the FGC Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except obligations
or liabilities incurred after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course
of business consistent with prior practice. The business of

FGC and each FGC Subsidiary has been conducted only in the ordinary course of
business since December 31, 1992.

reflected on the books and records of each FGC Subsidiary have been (i) made

the consolidated balance sheet of FGC as of September 30, 1993 included in the

or any actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations or investigations pending or,

financial condition, results of operation or business of FGC or any FGC
Subsidiary, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
governmental entity or arbitrator outstanding against FGC or any FGC Subsidiary
having or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future could
have any such effect.

H. Agreements with Regulators. Neither FGC, any FGC
Subsidiary, nor any officer or director of FGC or any FGC Subsidiary, is a

or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letters
from, any banking regulator, nor has FGC or any FGC Subsidiary been advised by
any banking regulator that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is
considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order,

letter, commitment letter or similar submission. No investigation by any
governmental entity with respect to FGC or any FGC Subsidiary is pending or, to
the best knowledge of FGC, threatened and neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary
has knowledge of any basis for the commencement of any regulatory or
enforcement action against FGC or any FGC Subsidiary by any governmental or
regulatory authority.

15

<PAGE> 16

operation of the businesses of FGC and each FGC Subsidiary and is in compliance
in all material respects with the terms thereof. FGC and each FGC Subsidiary
has complied with in all material respects and is not in any default under (and
has not been charged with or received notice with respect to (except for
routine bank examinations by Federal and state agencies), nor are threatened
with or under investigation with respect to, any charge concerning any
violation of any provision of) any federal, state or local law, regulation,
ordinance, rule or order (whether executive, judicial, legislative or
administrative) or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court, agency
or instrumentality, except for possible violations or defaults that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
FGC and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There are no uncured violations or
violations with respect to which refunds or restitution may be required cited
in any report concerning FGC or any FGC Subsidiary as a result of examination
by any regulatory authority and neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary has
knowledge of any basis on which refunds or restitution may be required by any
regulatory authority.

J. Employee Benefit Plans.

(i) Since the date of the most recent FGC Financial
Statements, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any
material respect by FGC or any FGC Subsidiary of any collective
bargaining agreement, or any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase,
stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, severance,
disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan,
arrangement or understanding (whether or not legally binding)
providing benefits to any current or former employee or director of
FGC or any FGC Subsidiary (collectively, "Benefit Plans"). There
exist no employment, consulting, severance, termination or
indemnification agreements, arrangements or understandings between FGC
or any FGC Subsidiary and any officer, director or key employee of FGC
or any FGC Subsidiary.

(ii) FGC has Previously Disclosed a list and brief
description of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA")) (sometimes referred to herein as "Pension
Plans"), all "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA) and all other Benefit Plans maintained, or contributed
to, by FGC or any FGC Subsidiary for the benefit of any officers or
employees of FGC or any FGC Subsidiary. FGC has delivered to
Corporation true, complete and correct copies of (1) each Benefit Plan
(or, in the case of any unwritten Benefit Plans, descriptions
thereof), (2) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with
the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Benefit Plan, (if
any such report was required), (3)

16

<PAGE> 17

the most recent summary plan description for each Benefit Plan for
which such summary plan description is required, and (4) each trust
agreement and group annuity contract relating to any Benefit Plan. No
Benefit Plan provides medical or hospitalization benefits to retirees
or other former employees, other than medical benefits required to be
provided to qualified beneficiaries under the provisions of Section
4980B(f) of the Code and paid for entirely by the individual electing
such coverage under Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

(iii) Each Benefit Plan has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms. FGC, each FGC
Subsidiary and all the Benefit Plans are in compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. All reports, returns and
similar documents with respect to the Benefit Plans required to be
filed with any governmental agency or distributed to any Benefit Plan
participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed. There are
no investigations by any governmental agency, termination proceedings
or other claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of the Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or
involving any Benefit Plan or asserting any rights or claims to
benefits under any Benefit Plan that could give rise to any liability,
and, to the best knowledge of FGC, there are not any facts that could
give rise to any liability in the event of any such investigation,
claim, suit or proceeding.

(iv) All Pension Plans have been the subject of
determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect
that such Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income
taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code. No
such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the best knowledge
of FGC, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Pension Plan
been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its costs.

(v) No Pension Plan that FGC, any FGC Subsidiary
or any other company under common control with FGC (within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) maintains, or to which FGC, any FGC
Subsidiary or any other company under common control with FGC (within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) is obligated to
contribute, other than any Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)
(collectively, the "Multiemployer Pension Plans"), had, as of the
respective last annual valuation date for each such Pension Plan, an
"unfunded benefit liability" (as such term is defined in Section
4001(a)(18) of ERISA). FGC is not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would change the funded status of any such

17

<PAGE> 18

Pension Plan. None of the Pension Plans has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived. All contributions
to, and payments from, the Benefit Plans required to be made in
accordance with the Benefit Plans and, when applicable, Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, have been timely made, and there has
been no application for or waiver of the minimum funding standards
imposed by Section 412 of the Code with respect to any Pension Plan.
All such contributions to, and payments from, the Benefit Plans
(except those payments to be made from a trust qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code), for any period ending before the Effective Time
that are not yet, but will be, required to be made, will be properly
accrued and reflected in the proper books and records of FGC at the
Effective Time. None of FGC, any FGC Subsidiary or any officer of FGC
or any FGC Subsidiary or any of the employee benefit plans of FGC and
any FGC Subsidiary which are subject to ERISA, including the Pension
Plans, or any trusts created thereunder, any administrator or, to the
best knowledge of FGC, any trustee thereof, has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary
responsibility under Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of ERISA that could
subject FGC, any FGC Subsidiary or any officer of FGC or any FGC
Subsidiary to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section 502(i) or (1) of
ERISA. Neither any of such plans nor any of such trusts have been
terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event" (as that term is
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect thereto during the last
five years. Neither FGC, any FGC Subsidiary, any administrator, nor,
to the best knowledge of FGC, any trustee or other fiduciary, of any
Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing has engaged in any
transaction or acted or failed to act in a manner that could subject
FGC or any FGC Subsidiary to any material liability for breach of
fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable law. Neither FGC
nor any FGC Subsidiary (or any other employer that since September 2,
1974 has ever been treated as a "single employer" under Section
414(b)(c) or (m) of the Code with FGC or any FGC Subsidiary) has ever
been required to contribute to any Multiemployer Pension Plans.

(vi) With respect to any Pension Plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA (including for purposes of clause (1) below, any
Pension Plan maintained or contributed to by FGC or any other company
under common control with FGC within the meaning of Section 414 of the
Code and, for purposes of clause (2) below, any Pension Plan
maintained or contributed to by FGC or any other company under common
control with FGC within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA):
FGC has not incurred any material liability on or prior to the date
hereof

18

<PAGE> 19

(1) to such Pension Plan or (2) to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation other than for the payment of premiums, all of which have
been paid when due. FGC has furnished to Corporation the most recent
actuarial report or valuation with respect to each Pension Plan that
is a "defined benefit pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA). The information supplied to the actuary by FGC for use in
preparing those reports or valuations was complete and accurate and
FGC has no reason to believe that the conclusions expressed in those
reports or valuations are incorrect.

(vii) With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan: (1) no such Benefit Plan is unfunded or
funded through a welfare benefits fund, as such term is defined in
Section 419(e) of the Code, (2) each such Benefit Plan that is a group
health plan, as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code, complies with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of
the Code and (3) each such Benefit Plan (including any such Plan
covering retirees or other former employees) may be prospectively
amended or terminated without material liability to FGC or any FGC
Subsidiary on or at any time after the Effective Time.

(viii) Each employee bonus or profit sharing plan
providing benefits to any current or former officer, director or
employee of FGC or any FGC Subsidiary is terminable by FGC or such FGC
Subsidiary without notice at any time.

K. Labor Matters.

(i) FGC and each FGC Subsidiary is in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable laws respecting employment
and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages
and hours and occupational safety and health;

(ii) There is no unfair labor practice charge or
complaint or any other matter against or involving FGC or any FGC
Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of FGC, threatened before the
National Labor Relations Board or any court of law;

(iii) Neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary is a party
to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or any similar
labor union arrangement;

(iv) There are no charges, investigations,
administrative proceedings or formal complaints of discrimination
(including discrimination based upon sex, age, marital status, race,
color, religion, national origin, sexual preference, disability,
handicap or veteran status) pending or, to the knowledge of FGC
threatened, before the Equal Employment

19

<PAGE> 20

Opportunity Commission or any federal, state or local agency or court
against FGC or any FGC Subsidiary;

(v) There have been no governmental audits of the
equal employment opportunity practices of FGC or any FGC Subsidiary
and, to the knowledge of FGC, no basis for any such claim exists; and

(vi) FGC and each FGC Subsidiary is in compliance in
all material respects with the requirements of the Americans With
Disabilities Act.

L. Brokers. Neither FGC, any FGC Subsidiary, nor any of
their respective officers, directors or employees, has employed any broker,
finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for fees or commissions
payable to any broker, finder or financial advisor in connection with the
negotiations relating to or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

M. Assets. FGC and each FGC Subsidiary has good and
marketable title to all of the properties and assets, real and personal,
tangible and intangible, reflected on the FGC Financial Statements or acquired
after the dates thereof, free and clear of all liens, charges, security
interests, encumbrances and claims, except for (i) liens for current taxes not
yet due and payable, (ii) pledges to secure deposits and other liens incurred
in the ordinary course of its business, and (iii) such imperfections or
irregularities of title, easements, claims, liens, charges, security interests
and encumbrances, if any, as do not materially affect the use of the properties
or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair
business operations at such properties. All leases by which either of FGC or
any FGC Subsidiary leases real or personal property as lessee (other than
leases that are the equivalent of extensions of credit) are valid without
default in any material respect thereunder by the lessee or, to the best
knowledge of FGC, the lessor, and are in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms.

N. Material Contracts. Except as disclosed in any FGC
SEC Document, neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary is a party to any:

(i) agreement, arrangement or commitment not made
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

(ii) employment agreement or any bonus, incentive,
deferred compensation, severance pay, profit sharing, retirement,
stock purchase, stock option agreement or arrangement or employee
benefit plan for or in respect of any employee or former employee;

20

<PAGE> 21

(iii) collective bargaining agreement or other 
agreement with any labor union or labor organization;

(iv) material agreement, indenture or other
instrument relating to the borrowing of money, or the guaranty of any
obligation for the borrowing of money or any agreement that involves a
potential material liability (other than in the ordinary course of its
business);

(v) any agreement, contract or commitment
containing any covenant materially limiting the freedom of FGC or any
FGC Subsidiary to engage in any line of business in any geographic
area or to compete with any person; or

(vi) agreement for loans or the provision,
purchase or sale of goods, services or property, or other contract or
commitment with any director or officer.

O. Good Standing of Contracts. No event or condition has
occurred or exists, or, to the best knowledge of FGC, is alleged by any of the
other parties thereto to have occurred or existed, which constitutes, or with
lapse of time or giving of notice or both might constitute, a default or breach
under any of the leases, contracts or agreements to which FGC or any FGC
Subsidiary is a party, which default is reasonably likely to result in a
material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operation or
business of FGC or any FGC Subsidiary.

P. Insurance. FGC has Previously Disclosed a list and
of all policies of fire, theft, liability and other insurance and bonds
maintained with respect to the assets or businesses of FGC and each FGC
Subsidiary, the effective dates thereof and the premiums payable with respect
thereto. All such policies and bonds are valid and enforceable and in full
force and effect and neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary has received any notice
of premium increases or cancellations with respect to any of such policies and
bonds. To the best knowledge of FGC, neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary is
liable for any material retroactive premium adjustments with respect to any of
its insurance policies or bonds.

Q. Tax Matters. Each member of the consolidated group
of which FGC is a member or has ever been a member (the "Group") has timely
filed or caused to be filed all federal, state, foreign and local income,
franchise, gross receipts, payroll, sales, use, withholding, occupancy, excise,
real and personal property, employment and other tax returns, tax information
returns and reports required to be filed, and has paid, or made adequate
provisions for the payment of, all taxes, duties or assessments of any nature
whatsoever, interest payments, penalties and additions (whether or not
reflected in its returns as filed) due and payable (and/or properly accruable
for all periods ending on or before the date of this Agreement) to any city,
county, state, foreign

21

<PAGE> 22

country, the United States or any other taxing authority. The most recent FGC
Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes payable by FGC
and each FGC Subsidiary accrued through the date of such Financial Statements.
No material deficiencies for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed
against FGC or any FGC Subsidiary that are not adequately reserved for. Except
with respect to claims for refund, the federal income tax returns of FGC and
each FGC Subsidiary consolidated in such returns have been examined by and
settled with the United States Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), or the
statue of limitations with respect to such years has expired (and no waiver
extending the statute of limitations has been requested or granted) for all
years through 1989. The consolidated federal income tax returns of the Group
have not been audited during the last five (5) fiscal years of FGC. No audit,
examination or investigation is presently being conducted or, to the best
knowledge of FGC, threatened by any taxing authority; no unpaid tax
deficiencies or additional liabilities of any sort have been proposed by any
governmental representative; and no agreements for the extension of time for
the assessment of any amounts of tax have been entered into by or on behalf of
any member of the Group.

R. Fiduciary Activities. Each FGC Subsidiary's
fiduciary and custodial activities have been and are being conducted in all
material respects in accordance with all applicable law.

S. Environmental Matters. To the best knowledge of FGC:

(i) FGC and each FGC Subsidiary is in substantial
compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules,
regulations, ordinances and requirements relating to the environment
("Environmental Laws");

(ii) No "Hazardous Wastes" (as hereinafter defined) have
ever been generated, transported, treated, stored, released or
disposed of on any real property owned or leased by FGC or FGC
Subsidiary;

(iii) Neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary has transported or
disposed or caused or permitted any person to transport or dispose of
any Hazardous Wastes other than in accordance with all Environmental
Laws;

(iv) Neither FGC nor any FGC Subsidiary has ever violated
any of the Environmental Laws;

(v) No asbestos, PCBs or other Hazardous Wastes or any
petroleum product or constituents thereof is present on, in or under
any of the property owned by FGC or any FGC Subsidiary, whether owned
or leased or held as OREO (as such term is

22

<PAGE> 23

customarily used) or in which FGC or any FGC Subsidiary has any legal
or equitable interest;

(vi) There are no loans or other credits included in the
loan portfolio of any FGC Subsididary with respect to which FGC or any
FGC Subsidiary is or could incur or become responsible liability under
the Environmental Laws, except where such liability would not have a
material adverse effect on FGC and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
and

(vii) No Hazardous Wastes have ever been utilized on any of
the property now held or previously held by FGC or any FGC Subsidiary
as collateral or otherwise securing any loan made by FGC or any FGC
Subsidiary.

Hazardous Wastes" for purposes of this Agreement shall include,
without limitation: (i) hazardous substances or hazardous wastes, as those
terms are defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq., the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq., and any other applicable federal,
state or local law, rule, regulation, ordinance or requirement, all as amended
or hereafter amended; (ii) petroleum, including without limitation crude oil
or any fraction thereof which is liquid at standard conditions of temperature
and pressure (60 degrees Fahrenheit and 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute);
(iii) any radioactive material , including without limitation any source,
special nuclear, or by-product material as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 2011 et
seq.; and (iv) asbestos or any asbestiform minerals in any form or condition.

T. Insider Loans. All loans, loan commitments and any
other extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit that are currently
outstanding by FGC or any FGC Subsidiary to directors, officers, or principal
shareholders of FGC or any FGC Subsidiary or any of their related interests,
were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
other persons, and substantially comply with all applicable provisions of
federal and state law. Such loans, extensions and commitments do not involve
more than a normal risk of collectability.

U. Adjustable Rate Mortgages. Each FGC Subsidiary has
properly calculated, in accordance with the contractual terms thereof and all
applicable law, all adjustments required in its portfolio of adjustable rate
mortgage notes, except for possible violations or errors that individually or
in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on FGC and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole.

V. Regulatory Matters. Neither FGC nor any FGC
Subsidiary has, through the date hereof, taken or agreed to take

23

<PAGE> 24

any action or has knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would materially
impede or delay receipt of any approval referred to in Section 5.2E hereof.

W. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as
Previously Disclosed, since December 31, 1992, FGC and the FGC Subsidiaries
have not incurred any material liability, except in the ordinary course of
their business consistent with their past practices, nor has there been any
change, or any event involving a prospective change, in the business, assets,
financial condition or results of operations of FGC or any of its FGC
Subsidiaries that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a material adverse
effect on FGC and FGC's Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

X. Full Disclosure. No representation or warranty of
FGC contained in this Agreement and no statement contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate or other instrument furnished to Corporation hereunder
contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or
will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements contained
herein or therein not misleading.

4.3 Corporation's Representations and Warranties. Except as
Previously Disclosed, Corporation hereby represents and warrants to FGC that:

A. Corporate Standing; Authorization.

(i) Corporation is a bank holding company
registered under the BHCA and a savings and loan holding company
registered under the Home Owners' Loan Act. Corporation and each
Corporation Subsidiary is a Kentucky corporation or national bank or
savings association duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under applicable laws. Corporation and each Corporation
